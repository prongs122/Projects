# Two functions have been written in order to implement the naive Bayes algorithm and predict the class for 
# test data. Please note that the argument "target" in the modelNaiveBayes function requires the class outcome
# name to be entered as a string. For the breast cancer dataset used in the assignment, target is set to "class".

# This script contains three functions. The first, modelNaiveBayes, was written to create conditional 
# probability look up tables. The second, predictNaiveBayes, was written in order to make predictions on 
# test data and return a vector of winning class outcomes. The third function, main, carries out the task of
# creating a naive Bayes model, predicting class of test data and visualising the differences between actual
# and predicted classes.

###!!!! Run entire script !!!!###

# The modelNaiveBayes function takes three arguments:
#1 target (a string of the target class) 
#2 data (training dataframe)
#3 laplace (an integer value for Laplace smoothing)

#2 newdata (test data to make predictions on, can be unlabelled or labelled)
