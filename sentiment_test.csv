Once again Mr. Costner has dragged out a movie for far longer than necessary. Aside from the terrific sea rescue sequences  of which there are very few I just did not care about any of the characters. Most of us have ghosts in the closet  and Costner's character are realized early on  and then forgotten until much later  by which time I did not care. The character we should really care about is a very cocky  overconfident Ashton Kutcher. The problem is he comes off as kid who thinks he's better than anyone else around him and shows no signs of a cluttered closet. His only obstacle appears to be winning over Costner. Finally when we are well past the half way point of this stinker  Costner tells us all about Kutcher's ghosts. We are told why Kutcher is driven to be the best with no prior inkling or foreshadowing. No magic here  it was all I could do to keep from turning it off an hour in.,negative
I was looking forward to this movie. Trustworthy actors  interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? IF you are going to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. First. Know it. OK I did not expect the directors or writers to actually know the meaning but I thought they may have offered crumbs to peck at and treats to add fuel to the fire-Which! they almost did. Things I didn't get. A woman wandering around in dark places and lonely car parks alone-oblivious to the consequences. Great riddles that fell by the wayside. The promise of the knowledge therein contained by the original so-called criminal. I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the suspense. I understood and can wax lyrical about the fool and found Adrian Pauls role crucial and penetrating and then ????? Basically the story line and the script where good up to a point and that point was the last 10 minutes or so. What? Run out of ideas! Such a pity that this movie had to let us down so badly. It may not comprehend the meaning and I really did not expect the writers to understand it but I was hoping for an intellectual  if not spiritual ride and got a bump in the road,negative
I gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars.<br /><br />Unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress  in this film it's Carly Pope  behaving like a ditz  don't bother.<br /><br />Carly Pope plays Sara Novak  a young college student  who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles  that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go in alone.<br /><br />There are various intrigues in the film -- a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking Sara  a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto  a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynic's shop  and a woman named Emily Gray  who is back in prison.<br /><br />Sara's father is a lawyer who is handling Emily Gray's case. <br /><br />A few years back  Emily Gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy. Emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years  and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again  even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged.<br /><br />The only explanation Emily has ever given for her crime is: I never sinned.<br /><br />It's all part of the design.<br /><br />Well  my friend  don't expect to ever get any better explanation than that  because you won't.,negative
I of course saw the previews for this at the beginning of some other Lion's Gate extravaganza  so of course it was only the best parts and therefore looked intriguing. And it is  to a point. A young college student (Sarah)is finding riddles all over the place and is becoming obsessed with answering them  and in doing so she's unwittingly becoming involved in some game. Now that's fairly intriguing right there but unfortunately it all gets rather muddled and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like myself) will most likely become frustrated. Characters appear with little introduction and you're not really sure who they are or why Sarah knows them or is hanging out with them. All of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown a young boy years ago and her reason for that was that it's all part of the design. In reality  it's all part of the very sketchy script and when the film is over you'll find yourself feeling that you've lost about an hour and a half of your life that you want back for more productive uses of your time  like cleaning the bathroom  for instance. 4 out of 10.,negative
too bad this movie isn't. While Nemesis Game is mildly entertaining  I found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie  especially the situations that Sara was putting herself into. Are we supposed to believe that:<br /><br />1) this hot chick is going to go slumming unarmed around abandoned buildings and dark subway tunnels in the middle of the night just to solve some riddles?<br /><br />2) the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play riddle games for fun  but don't put the whole I Never Sinned riddle together until the very end...and then...and then...get this...she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together?? I know it was the filmmaker's device to show the audience what was going on  but do they really think we're that stupid?<br /><br />3) when Vern and Sara go to the Chez M to question the blonde  there is not ONE topless chick in the whole building. Nada. C'mon. I know it's Canada  but I would expect more from a country that gave us Shannon Tweed.<br /><br />And anyone else notice that when Vern was surfing the Web and found that riddlezone site  that when he moused over the link the cursor stayed an arrow  and didn't turn into a little hand (LIKE ALL CURSORS DO WHEN YOU CLICK ON A HYPERLINK)?!? I mean  if you're gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie  at least get the little things right. Geez.,negative
Years ago  when DARLING LILI played on TV  it was always the pan and scan version  which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format. So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie Andrews/Blake Edwards opus  I decided to purchase and watch it once and for all.<br /><br />Boy  what a terrible film. It's so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. Looking at it now  it's obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS  SOUND OF MUSIC  THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE  etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT  MY FAIR LADY  etc) because Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort  to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities  never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole  it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.<br /><br />Mind you  the version on the DVD is the director's cut  or in this case  let's salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop. In releasing the DVD  Edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version. The film moves along with no idea of what it is. We are 25 minutes into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going. What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for someone's death? Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews. Things aren't helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why him and not other men she got involved with? There should have been one of her ex hanging around  trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action. It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings. There's no catalyst in this story.<br /><br />One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews' (and Edwards') previous successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC. It's no wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in 1970  that scene might have worked on a certain level but today  that moment reeks of desperation. There are other plot elements directly inspired by Andrews/Edwards other films. The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment I'll give you three guesses was created just to make fun of Julie's MARY POPPINS persona  which is turned raunchy with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The ending  bird's eye view of Julie running towards Hudson's plane  is another wink at SOUND OF MUSIC.<br /><br />The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer  born from a German father and British mother  who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are just badly edited. Like when Julie and her uncle are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence. I'm like what happened here?<br /><br />The comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy. Every scene with the French police are pathetic. Where's Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her uncle are on their way to Germany on that train  Hudson's squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train  almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. What's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning. That's one slow moving train there. <br /><br />The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason I gave this film 3 stars) but it's effect is diminished considerably because it's repeated at the end. Speaking of redundant  did we really need to see a can-can dance  Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? The Girl in no man's land is OK even if it's bleeding obvious  but that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital  making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?<br /><br />The whole project is listless and without energy. The romance is 100% unbelievable. Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). Julie looks dazed  like she's on Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie  she's no Greta Garbo  who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI. Funny enough  even if Julie plays a German spy  she still comes across as cloying and cute.<br /><br />How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its release  Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release.,negative
This movie had a very unique effect on me: it stalled my realization that this movie REALLY sucks! It is disguised as a thinker's film in the likes of Memento and other jewels like that  but at the end  and even after a few minutes  you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious cr4p. Probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks. The whole idea is  I don't even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural  or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (a very weak one  btw) with stupid riddles  the kind you learn on elementary school recess  you suddenly come to the one truth about everything  then you have to kill someone and confess. !!! What? How  what  why  WHY? Is just like saying that to make a cake  just throw a bunch of ingredients  and add water forgot about cooking it? I guess these guys forgot to  not explain  but present the mechanism of WHY was this happening? You have to do that when you present a story which normal  everyday acts (lie solving riddle rhymes) start to have an abnormal effect on people. Acting was horrible  with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera  and the guy from Highlanders  the series  acting up like the though heavy metal record store (yeah  they're all real though s-o-b's). The menacing atmosphere  with the oh-so-clever riddles (enter the 60's series of Batman and Robin  with guest appearance of The Riddle) and the crazies who claim to have the knowledge behind that smirk on their faces just horrible  HORRIBLE.<br /><br />I'm usually very partial about low budget movies  and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve  in lieu of their constrictions  you know  but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half  and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it.,negative
The Forgotten (AKA: Don't Look In The Basement) is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror movie.<br /><br />The story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited about.<br /><br />The patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially Sam and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone. (Look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera  tell me you can watch without laughing!).<br /><br />Now the gore is very poor looking  with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesn't really deserve its place on the video nasties list!.<br /><br />Overall if you aren't looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time to spare then it's worth a watch.,negative
Dr Stephens (Micheal Harvey) runs a mental asylum. He has a different approach to the insane. He conducts unorthodox methods of treatment. He treats everyone like family  there are no locks on the patients doors and he lets some of the inmates act out their twisted fantasies. He lets Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) dress and act as a soldier and Harriet (Camilla Carr) be a mother to a doll  including letting her put it to bed in a cot. Dr. Stevens is outside letting Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross) chop a log up with an axe  it turns out to be a bad move as once Dr. Stevens back is turned the Judge plants the axe in his shoulder. Soon after Nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the Sanitarium having arranged an interview with Dr. Stevens about a possible job. She is met by the head Nurse  Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a trail position. She gets to know and becomes well liked among the patients. However things eventually start to turn sour  the phone lines are cut  an old lady named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has her tongue cut out and she starts to get a strange feeling that things just aren't right somehow. Then  one night all the Sanitariums dark secrets are violently revealed. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg this film has a great central idea which builds into a cool twist ending  but ultimately is a bit of a chore to sit through because of it's low budget restrictions and a rather slow script by Tim Pope. There are just too many long boring stretches of dialogue by the inmates  not a lot really happens until the final twenty odd minutes. The film has no real visual quality as it's set entirely in the Sanitarium and it's grounds which is basically just a big bland house in the middle of nowhere. There's no graphic gore in it  a few splashes of blood here and there and thats yer lot. There's a bit of nudity  but like the gore not much. The acting is pretty strong  especially Holotik and Weenick. The photography is flat and unexciting and I can't even remember what the music was like. The twist ending is great  but it just takes far too long to get to it. A film that had a lot of potential that was probably held back by it's budget. OK I guess  but I think it would have worked a lot better if the story had been turned into a half an hour 'Tales form the Crypt' episode.,negative
Low budget horror movie. If you don't raise your expectations too high  you'll probably enjoy this little flick. Beginning and end are pretty good  middle drags at times and seems to go nowhere for long periods as we watch the goings on of the insane that add atmosphere but do not advance the plot. Quite a bit of gore. I enjoyed Bill McGhee's performance which he made quite believable for such a low budget picture  he managed to carry the movie at times when nothing much seemed to be happening. Nurse Charlotte Beale  played by Jesse Lee  played her character well so be prepared to want to slap her toward the end! She makes some really stupid mistakes but then  that's what makes these low budget movies so good! I would have been out of that place and five states away long before she even considered that it might be a good idea to leave! If you enjoy this movie  try Committed from 1988 which is basically a rip off of this movie.,negative
Every movie I have PPV'd because Leonard Maltin praised it to the skies has blown chunks! Every single one! When will I ever learn?<br /><br />Evie is a raving Old Bag who thinks nothing of saying she's dying of breast cancer to get her way! Laura is an insufferable Medusa filled with The Holy Spirit (and her hubby's protégé)! Caught between these harpies is Medusa's dumb-as-a-rock boy who has been pressed into weed-pulling servitude by The Old Bag!<br /><br />As I said  when will I ever learn?<br /><br />I was temporarily lifted out of my malaise when The Old Bag stuck her head in a sink  but  unfortunately  she did not die. I was temporarily lifted out of my malaise again when Medusa got mowed down  but  unfortunately  she did not die. It should be a capital offense to torture audiences like this!<br /><br />Without Harry Potter to kick him around  Rupert Grint is just a pair of big blue eyes that practically bulge out of its sockets. Julie Walters's scenery-chewing (especially the scene when she plays God) is even more shameless than her character.<br /><br />At least this Harold bangs some bimbo instead of Maude. For that  I am truly grateful. And if you're reading this Mr. Maltin  you owe me $3.99!,negative
Ben  (Rupert Grint)  is a deeply unhappy adolescent  the son of his unhappily married parents. His father  (Nicholas Farrell)  is a vicar and his mother  (Laura Linney)  is ... well  let's just say she's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus' army. It's only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul-mouthed  eccentric  once-famous and now-forgotten actress Evie Walton  (Julie Walters)  that he finally finds himself in true 'Harold and Maude' fashion. Of course  Evie is deeply unhappy herself and it's only when these two sad sacks find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness.<br /><br />Of course it's corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it  too and Walters  who could sleep-walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted  is excellent. It's when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character  (like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink)  that she's at her best. The problem is she's the only interesting character in the film (and it's not because of the script which doesn't do anybody any favours). Grint  on the other hand  isn't just unhappy; he's a bit of a bore as well while Linney's starched bitch is completely one-dimensional. (Still  she's got the English accent off pat). The best that can be said for it is that it's mildly enjoyable - with the emphasis on the mildly.,negative
I just finished watching this movie and am disappointed to say that I didn't enjoy it a bit. It is so slow Slow and uninteresting. This kid from Harry Potter plays a shy teenager with an rude mother  and then one day the rude mother tells the kid to find a job so that they could accommodate an old guy apparently having no place to live has started to live with his family and therefore the kid goes to work for a old lady. And this old lady who is living all alone teaches him about girls  driving car and life! I couldn't get how an 18 year old guy enjoy spending time with an awful lady in her 80s. Sorry if my comments on this movie has bothered people who might have enjoyed it  I could be wrong as I am not British and may not understand the social and their family structure and way of life. Mostly the movie is made for the British audience.,negative
This cheap  grainy-filmed Italian flick is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the Italian countryside who head up to the house to stay  and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that house.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed by this. It wasn't really that scary  mostly just the way a cheap Italian film should be. A girl  her two cousins  and one cousin's girlfriend  head to this huge house for some reason (I couldn't figure out why) and are staying there  cleaning up and checking out the place. Characters come in and out of the film  and it's quite boring at points  and the majority of deaths are quite rushed. The girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death  and the scene is quite good  but then things get slow again  until a confusing end  when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way  and this weirdo guy (I couldn't figure out who he was during the movie  or maybe I just don't remember) goes after this one girl  attacking her  until finally this other girl kills him off. Hate to give away the ending  but oh well. The female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it  and they show scenes of her living there years later. The end. You really aren't missing anything  and anyway  you probably won't find this anywhere  so lucky you.,negative
Now  I LOVE Italian horror films. The cheesier they are  the better. However  this is not cheesy Italian. This is week-old spaghetti sauce with rotting meatballs. It is amateur hour on every level. There is no suspense  no horror  with just a few drops of blood scattered around to remind you that you are in fact watching a horror film. The special effects consist of the lights changing to red whenever the ghost (or whatever it was supposed to be) is around  and a string pulling bed sheets up and down. Oooh  can you feel the chills? The DVD quality is that of a VHS transfer (which actually helps the film more than hurts it). The dubbing is below even the lowest bad Italian movie standards and I gave it one star just because the dialogue is so hilarious! And what do we discover when she finally DOES look in the attic (in a scene that is daytime one minute and night the next)...well  I won't spoil it for anyone who really wants to see  but let's just say that it isn't very novel!,negative
A group of heirs to a mysterious old mansion find out that they have to live in it as part of a clause in the will or be disinherited  but they soon find out of its history of everybody whom had lived there before them having either died in weird accidents or having had killed each other.<br /><br />You've seen it all before  and this one is too low-budget and slow paced to be scary  and doesn't have any real surprises in the climax. No special effects or gore to speak of  in fact the only really amusing thing about the whole film is the quality of the English dubbing  which at times is as bad as a cheap martial arts movie.<br /><br />3 out of 10  pretty low in the pecking order of 80's haunted house movies.,negative
Julie Andrews satirically prods her own goody-two-shoes image in this overproduced musical comedy-drama  but if she approaches her role with aplomb  she's alone in doing so. Blake Edwards' film about a woman who is both music-hall entertainer and German spy during WWI doesn't know what tone to aim for  and Rock Hudson has the thankless task of playing romantic second-fiddle. Musicals had grown out of favor by 1970  and elephantine productions like Star! and this film really tarnished Andrews' reputation  leaving a lot of dead space in her catalogue until The Tamarind Seed came along. I've always thought Julie Andrews would've made a great villain or shady lady; her strong voice could really command attention  and she hits some low notes that can either be imposing or seductive. Husband/director Edwards seems to realize this  but neither he nor Julie can work up much energy within this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter Blatty isn't a good partner for Edwards  and neither man has his heart in this material. Beatty's script offers Andrews just one fabulous sequence--a striptease. *1/2 from ****,negative
"I saw the Mogul Video VHS of this. That's another one of those old 1980s distributors whose catalog I wish I had!<br /><br />This movie was pretty poor. Though retitled Don't Look in the Attic, the main admonition that is repeated in this is Don't go to the villa. Just getting on the grounds of the villa is a bad idea. A character doesn't go into the attic until an hour into the movie  and actually should have done it earlier because of what is learned there.<br /><br />The movie starts in Turin  Italy in the 1950s. Two men are fighting  and a woman is telling them the villa is making them do it. One man kills the other  then regrets it  and the woman pulls out the knife and stabs him with it. She flees the villa  and after she's left a chair moves by itself (what's the point of that?)  but when in the garden a hand comes up through the ground and drags he into the earth.<br /><br />From there  it's the present day  thirty years later. There's a séance that appears suddenly and doesn't appear to have anything to do with the movie. The children of the woman from the prologue are inheriting the house. The main daughter is played by the same actress who played her mother. At least one of the two men from the prologue seems to reoccur as another character too. She's haunted by some warnings not to go to the villa  but they all do  since if they do not use it  they forfeit it. People die. A lawyer who has won all his cases tries to investigate a little. The ending is pretty poor. Why was the family cursed? An unfortunately boring movie.<br /><br />There's an amusing small-print disclaimer on the back of the video box that reads The scenes depicted on this packaging may be an artist's impression and may not necessarily represent actual scenes from the film. In this case  the cover of the box is an illustration that does more or less accurately depict the aforementioned woman dragged underground scene  although there are two hands  and the woman is different. It's true  sometimes the cover art has nothing to do with the movie. I also recall seeing a reviewer who had a bad movie predictor scale  in which movies with illustrations on the cover instead of photos got at least one point for that.",negative
I first watched this movie back in the mid/late 80's  when I was a kid. We couldn't even get all the way through it. The dialog  the acting  everything about it was just beyond lame.<br /><br />Here are a few examples... imagine these spoken real dramatically  way over-acted: Oreegon? You're going to Oreegon? Why would anyone want to go to Oreegon?<br /><br />Survivalists? Nobody ever told us about any survivalists!<br /><br />This movie was SO bad  my sister and I rented it again for her 16th birthday party  just so our friends could sit around and laugh at how awful it was. I don't think we were able to finish it then either!,negative
Blind Date (Columbia Pictures  1934)  was a decent film  but I have a few issues with this film. First of all  I don't fault the actors in this film at all  but more or less  I have a problem with the script. Also  I understand that this film was made in the 1930's and people were looking to escape reality  but the script made Ann Sothern's character look weak. She kept going back and forth between suitors and I felt as though she should have stayed with Paul Kelly's character in the end. He truly did care about her and her family and would have done anything for her and he did by giving her up in the end to fickle Neil Hamilton who in my opinion was only out for a good time. Paul Kelly's character  although a workaholic was a man of integrity and truly loved Kitty (Ann Sothern) as opposed to Neil Hamilton  while he did like her a lot  I didn't see the depth of love that he had for her character. The production values were great  but the script could have used a little work.,negative
This flick is a waste of time.I expect from an action movie to have more than 2 explosions and some shooting.Van Damme's acting is awful. He never was much of an actor  but here it is worse.He was definitely better in his earlier movies. His screenplay part for the whole movie was probably not more than one page of stupid nonsense one liners.The whole dialog in the film is a disaster  same as the plot.The title The Shepherd makes no sense. Why didn't they just call it Border patrol? The fighting scenes could have been better  but either they weren't able to afford it  or the fighting choreographer was suffering from lack of ideas.This is a cheap low type of action cinema.,negative
Honestly awful film  bad editing  awful lighting  dire dialog and scrappy screenplay.<br /><br />The lighting at is so bad there's moments you can't even see what's going on  I even tried to playing with the contrast and brightness so I could see something but that didn't help.<br /><br />They must have found the script in a bin  the character development is just as awful and while you hardly expect much from a Jean-Claude Van Damme film this one manages to hit an all time low. You can't even laugh at the cheesy'ness.<br /><br />The directing and editing are also terrible  the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak it's just unreal.<br /><br />There's not a lot else to say other than it's really bad and nothing like Jean-Claude Van Damme's earlier work which you could enjoy.<br /><br />Avoid like the plaque  frankly words fail me in condemning this film.,negative
Technically I'am a Van Damme Fan  or I was. this movie is so bad that I hated myself for wasting those 90 minutes. Do not let the name Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II) fool you  I had big hopes for this one  depending on what I saw in (Undisputed II)  man.. was I wrong ??! all action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero  but i guess we wont be able to see that soon  as our hero keep coming with those (going -to-a-border - far-away-town-and -kill -the-bad-guys- than-comeback- home) movies I mean for God's sake  we are in 2008  and they insist on doing those disappointing movies on every level. Why ??!!! Do your self a favor  skip it.. seriously.,negative
It actually pains me to say it  but this movie was horrible on every level. The blame does not lie entirely with Van Damme as you can see he tried his best  but let's face it  he's almost fifty  how much more can you ask of him? I find it so hard to believe that the same people who put together Undisputed 2; arguably the best (western) martial arts movie in years  created this. Everything from the plot  to the dialog  to the editing  to the overall acting was just horribly put together and in many cases outright boring and nonsensical. Scott Adkins who's fight scenes seemed more like a demo reel  was also terribly underused and not even the main villain which is such a shame because 1) He is more than capable of playing that role and 2) The actual main villain was not only not intimidating at all but also quite annoying. Again  not blaming Van Damme. I will always be a fan  but avoid this one.,negative
Isaac Florentine has made some of the best western Martial Arts action movies ever produced. In particular US Seals 2  Cold Harvest  Special Forces and Undisputed 2 are all action classics. You can tell Isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always eventful  creative and sharp affairs  with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for. In particular he has found a muse with Scott Adkins  as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for. This is borne out with Special Forces and Undisputed 2  but unfortunately The Shepherd just doesn't live up to their abilities.<br /><br />There is no doubt that JCVD looks better here fight-wise than he has done in years  especially in the fight he has (for pretty much no reason) in a prison cell  and in the final showdown with Scott  but look in his eyes. JCVD seems to be dead inside. There's nothing in his eyes at all. It's like he just doesn't care about anything throughout the whole film. And this is the leading man.<br /><br />There are other dodgy aspects to the film  script-wise and visually  but the main problem is that you are utterly unable to empathise with the hero of the film. A genuine shame as I know we all wanted this film to be as special as it genuinely could have been. There are some good bits  mostly the action scenes themselves. This film had a terrific director and action choreographer  and an awesome opponent for JCVD to face down. This could have been the one to bring the veteran action star back up to scratch in the balls-out action movie stakes.<br /><br />Sincerely a shame that this didn't happen.,negative
I had high hopes for this one until they changed the name to 'The Shepherd : Border Patrol  the lamest movie name ever  what was wrong with just 'The Shepherd'. This is a by the numbers action flick that tips its hat at many classic Van Damme films. There is a nice bit of action in a bar which reminded me of hard target and universal soldier but directed with no intensity or flair which is a shame. There is one great line about 'being p*ss drunk and carrying a rabbit' and some OK action scenes let down by the cheapness of it all. A lot of the times the dialogue doesn't match the characters mouth and the stunt men fall down dead a split second before even being shot. The end fight is one of the better Van Damme fights except the Director tries to go a bit too John Woo and fails also introducing flashbacks which no one really cares about just gets in the way of the action which is the whole point of a van Damme film.<br /><br />Not good  not bad  just average generic action.,negative
First off let me say  If you haven't enjoyed a Van Damme movie since bloodsport  you probably will not like this movie. Most of these movies may not have the best plots or best actors but I enjoy these kinds of movies for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the movies the other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have thought about putting out the past few years. Van Damme is good in the movie  the movie is only worth watching to Van Damme fans. It is not as good as Wake of Death (which i highly recommend to anyone of likes Van Damme) or In hell but  in my opinion it's worth watching. It has the same type of feel to it as Nowhere to Run. Good fun stuff!,negative
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Former New Orleans homicide cop Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme) is re-assigned to Columbus  a small but violent town in Mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a major heroin smuggling operation into their town. The culprits turn out to be ex-military  lead by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord  otherwise known as Jase from East Enders) who is using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight off his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason for taking him down  that draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will walk away alive.<br /><br />After Until Death  Van Damme appeared to be on a high  showing he could make the best straight to video films in the action market. While that was a far more drama oriented film  with The Shepherd he has returned to the high-kicking  no brainer action that first made him famous and has sadly produced his worst film since Derailed. It's nowhere near as bad as that film  but what I said still stands.<br /><br />A dull  predictable film  with very little in the way of any exciting action. What little there is mainly consists of some limp fight scenes  trying to look cool and trendy with some cheap slo-mo/sped up effects added to them that sadly instead make them look more desperate. Being a Mexican set film  director Isaac Florentine has tried to give the film a Robert Rodriguez/Desperado sort of feel  but this only adds to the desperation.<br /><br />VD gives a particularly uninspired performance and given he's never been a Robert De Niro sort of actor  that can't be good. As the villain  Lord shouldn't expect to leave the beeb anytime soon. He gets little dialogue at the beginning as he struggles to muster an American accent but gets mysteriously better towards the end. All the supporting cast are equally bland  and do nothing to raise the films spirits at all.<br /><br />This is one shepherd that's strayed right from the flock. *,negative
Blake Edwards tried very hard to change Julie Andrews image in this film. He tried to make her sexy not realizing she already was. I think they were both still a bit irked that Julie had not been chosen to film her Broadway success of Camelot and was passed over as not being sexy enough. Unfortunately  they chose this vehicle to try and assuage this belief. It gets to the point where it is almost funny seeing Rock Hudson  who we all know now was gay  kissing Julie every 2 minutes throughout this movie. It seems now that they were not only trying to make you believe that Julie was a femme fatale but that Rock was straight. Sadly  they have absolutely no chemistry together and the unending kissing scenes start grossing one out. The other error they made with this picture was not knowing what kind of movie they were making. It is almost three separate movies. There is the drama of Julie as the German spy trying to get military secrets from Rock. There is an air war movie with lots of footage of WWI vintage planes swooping about and there is the stupid attempts at humor that Blake Edwards seems to think he has to insert in every one of his pictures whether it is appropriate or not  In this case  it was not. The only truly redeeming qualities in this film are looking at the always lovely Dame Julie and hearing her sing in that crystal clear bell-like soprano. Of course if you love her  you may overlook the weaknesses of this film just because of her. You can always tell yourself  afterward  that it was a hell of a lot better than sitting through STAR!,negative
its a totally average film with a few semi-alright action sequences that make the plot seem a little better and remind the viewer of the classic van dam films. parts of the plot don't make sense and seem to be added in to use up time. the end plot is that of a very basic type that doesn't leave the viewer guessing and any twists are obvious from the beginning. the end scene with the flask backs don't make sense as they are added in and seem to have little relevance to the history of van dam's character. not really worth watching again  bit disappointed in the end production  even though it is apparent it was shot on a low budget certain shots and sections in the film are of poor directed quality,negative
Worth the entertainment value of a rental  especially if you like action movies. This one features the usual car chases  fights with the great Van Damme kick style  shooting battles with the 40 shell load shotgun  and even terrorist style bombs. All of this is entertaining and competently handled but there is nothing that really blows you away if you've seen your share before.<br /><br />The plot is made interesting by the inclusion of a rabbit  which is clever but hardly profound. Many of the characters are heavily stereotyped -- the angry veterans  the terrified illegal aliens  the crooked cops  the indifferent feds  the bitchy tough lady station head  the crooked politician  the fat federale who looks like he was typecast as the Mexican in a Hollywood movie from the 1940s. All passably acted but again nothing special.<br /><br />I thought the main villains were pretty well done and fairly well acted. By the end of the movie you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't. There was an emotional lift as the really bad ones got their just deserts. Very simplistic  but then you weren't expecting Hamlet  right? The only thing I found really annoying was the constant cuts to VDs daughter during the last fight scene.<br /><br />Not bad. Not good. Passable 4.,negative
I love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot. Sci-fi movies/TV are usually underfunded  under-appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to like this  I really did  but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics  cheap cardboard sets  stilted dialogues  CG that doesn't match the background  and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clichéd and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development  sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues  yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish  just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable  often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say Gene Roddenberry's Earth... otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull  cheap  poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space. Spoiler. So  kill off a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again.,negative
The opening of The Jungle promises us a safari adventure with a science fiction element  but mostly what we get is a travelogue with lots of stock footage and padding (and the odd leopard attack). The movie is leisurely when you want it to be gripping  and tries to inject interest into the proceedings with badly staged matches between various wild animals (I had no idea that lions and wild boars were natural enemies in the wild  did you? I thought the big cats stuck to hunting herbivores  but apparently the producers knew better). <br /><br />As for the actors: Cesar does his usual great job of rocking the mustache  and Marie Windsor is reasonably believable as the progressively thinking rajah's daughter (nice eyebrows  btw!). However  Rod Cameron is barely watchable as the hunter returning as the sole survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he was in demand in his day  but here he comes off as a Rent-A-Center Bogart : rough looking  but with none of Bogey's range or timing. He spends the movie going back and forth from stoic anger to angry stoicism  and any time the screenplay attempts to crank up some romantic sparks between himself and Windsor  you just have to laugh. That crabbed  knobby face isn't a good vehicle for tenderness. <br /><br />The screenplay is not entirely without merit  although it does make some odd choices. Early in the first act  the screenplay makes a point of spending several moments where the heroes decide to bring along the obligatory clever young boy and monkey mascot  but then basically ignore them until ***SPOILER*** the monkey somehow gets hold of a live hand grenade during the mammoth scene and accidentally tosses near Windsor. This is so Cameron can prove his bravery by diving on it and saving her life at the cost of his own.***END SPOILER. It's possible that the Indian version of this movie (which I understand ran better than 2 1/2 hours)  might have given the kid and the monkey more to do. <br /><br />Another thing that makes the film show its age **SPOILER**is the issue of the woolly mammoths (the plot device that sets the safari into motion in the first place). When they finally appear  the way the scene is filmed  it's obvious that the mammoths (obviously elephants draped in shag carpeting) aren't really attacking anyone  or even moving all that fast  and yet Cameron immediately sets to trying to wipe them out with hand grenades. These days  the idea of destroying the last known specimens of a species thought to be extinct would be unthinkable  especially when all they seem to do is roll through the jungle at a nice walking pace.***END OF SPOILER***<br /><br />So IMO  four stars  which is pretty good for a Robert Lippert production (normally Lippert hack jobs rate two or three stars at best). It's not a train wreck of a film  or anything; plus  it seems to mean well with the rajah's daughter arguing for amelioration of the most repressive aspect of the traditional ways and the elements of mixed race romance that was pretty progressive in 1952. And there's some nice scenery and exotic spectacle. See it if someone offers to show it to you for free  but don't expect much except an interesting historical chapter of early fantasy cinema.,negative
I cant explain what a load of rubbish this film is. Like really i cant. its just that bad.<br /><br />plot=crap acting=crap budget=so low its laughable<br /><br />Jesus  its like the only good thing in this movie is the fact the main character was fairly hot.<br /><br />The only people i feel  that think this movie is good are the ones who took part in the film. I'm sure they are not the ones who funded it because there was no money put into this. (HAHAhaha to the bit where there heads get shaved)<br /><br />This movie has already wasted too much of my life so i am not going to waste anymore time writing my review for it.,negative
From watching the trailer  the movie looked pretty interesting. The production of the movie is also pretty good--it looks like they had a good budget and doesn't look like a cheaply made movie. The acting ranges from good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to bad (James Haven as Don).<br /><br />The actual content and plot of the movie is weak. The movie starts out like it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed  disappointingly boring  twist. Watching the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes of the movie would have made this movie OK but everything in between makes this an absolutely boring movie to watch. It's as though they made a short movie then tried to force it to be over an hour long by stuffing the middle with an hour of filler material.<br /><br />If you want to waste a good hour and half of your life  watch this movie. Otherwise  stay away from this extremely boring movie.,negative
Breaking Dawn starts in a Californian college as Professor Simon (associate producer Joe Morton) tells his students that they have to perform an intensive six week study of a mental patient in Cape State Hospital as a crucial part of their education  fail & they will never become qualified Doctors. A bright  young  attractive & intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) is given a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) & is a convicted killer  he was found covered in blood besides the dead body of a woman (Diane Verona) & her young daughter (Jenette McCurdy). At first Don won't even look at Eve much less talk to her  but like the trooper she is Eve persists in trying to figure him out. Eventually Don begins to talk but what he says frightens Eve  he says that someone is watching her & mentions the name Malachay. Eve then begins to see a dark shadowy figure at her every turn  as Don churns out the conspiracy theories & bizarre statements Eve slowly begins to lose her mind as the line between fantasy & reality becomes more & more blurred. Is there something more to the supposed nonsense that Don talks other than being the insane ravings of a psychiatric patient...?<br /><br />Written & directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings towards Breaking Dawn. Now  we all like a good twist ending  the sort of ending which catches us unawares  surprises us  works well with the rest of the film & stays in our memory like the cool twist endings to The Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) to name just two good examples & to a lesser extent the endings to films such as Scream (1996) where the identity of the killer comes a nice surprise & isn't that obvious. Then  of course  there are films whose endings spoil everything that has gone before & as an example lets take  oh I don't know lets say Breaking Dawn because I have never seen such an awful ending to a film  never. Breaking Dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with spooky things starting to happen to Eve  it's not the most action packed film ever by any stretch of the imagination but it holds ones interest  it's not the most absorbing film ever either but it is more than watchable & it's not that bad a film until the twist ending  I have to keep mentioning it because everything else up to that point (which was OK to be fair to it) suddenly becomes irrelevant. I am sure there are people out there who think they have this muddled mess of an ending figured out down to the last detail  all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way to me & as far as I'm concerned it doesn't make a bit of sense & never will. Breaking Dawn is crap & it's a waste of time watching it to be rewarded with the lamest ending in film history  it's as simple & straight forward as that.<br /><br />Director Robinson doesn't half make a mess of what could have been a decent thriller  maybe he thought what he had shot would play out OK or maybe it was ruined in the editing room but I'd imagine it was more likely down to a rubbish script as he tries to tie all the absurdities together within the space of a few muddled minutes & give us all a happier than happy final shot. He builds the tension quite well during the first 80 odd minutes but it's all for nought at the end of the day.<br /><br />Technically Breaking Dawn is fine & it is generally well made throughout. The acting is pretty good  Overton is nice & easy on the eyes & puts in a decent performance. Was it just me or did the guy who played Don look like John Morghen star of such Italian sleaze classics as Cannibal Apocalypse (1980)  City of the Living Dead (1980)  The House on the Edge of the Park (1980)  Cannibal Ferox (1981)  Stagefright (1987) & The Church (1989)? OK  maybe it was just me...<br /><br />Breaking Dawn is rubbish  I hated it all because of the final few minutes. Don't get me wrong it wasn't exactly getting me excited up to that point but it was OK. Definitely one to avoid as far as I'm concerned although it seems to have it's fair share of positive comments on the IMDb...,negative
An obvious vanity press for Julie in her first movie with Blake. Let's see. Where do we begin. She is a traitor during a world war; she redeems that by falling in love; her friends (who are presumably patriots because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and she winds up as a heroine. OK. The scenes with the drunken pilot and the buffoons who work for French intelligence can't even be described  and we won't even mention Rock's romantic scenes with a female. (By the way  when they visit a museum  look at his gaze - I reran it on video and it's priceless). Is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I don't know and you won't either.,negative
Let me first start out by saying 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie. It's unfortunate that IMDb doesn't have tenths of a star... I watched this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia  and it was absolute garbage. The plot was horrible. The acting was horrible. The movie was utterly boring. malachi looked like the Shadow with Alec Baldwin (The Shadow is infinitely better than this as well) The character Eve was so undeveloped and 2 dimensional she didn't even grab my attention. I didn't even know her name was Eve. Don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut. The TWIST (if you can call it that) was laughable and pathetic. When it came  the movie had done such a horrid job of building suspense or attachment to any character that I simply thought Who gives a S***. The only thing that made me even lift an eyebrow about this movie was the fact the med. teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 (Also a movie that was light years ahead of this motion picture massacre.) Anyone who was involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for wasting 90 minutes of countless people's time. It's no wonder no actor from this movie ever had a fruitful career. In summary.... This movie is so bad  I feel dirty and need a shower. Worst movie in history  Gigli was better  Prom Night (the remake) was better and dare I say it Saw IV was better...........,negative
These days  writers  directors and producers are relying more and more on the surprise ending. The old art of bringing a movie to closure  taking all of the information we have learned through out the movie and bringing it to a nice complete ending  has been lost. Now what we have is a movie that  no matter how complex  detailed  or frivolous  can be wrapped up in 5 minutes. It was all in his/her head. That explanation is the director's safety net. If all else fails  or if the writing wasn't that good  or if we ran out of money to complete the movie  we can always say it was all in his/her head and end the movie that way. The audience will buy it because  well  none of us are psychologists  and none of us are suffering from schizophrenia (not that we know about) so we take the story and believe it. After all  the mind is a powerful thing. Some movies have pulled it off. But those movies are the reason why we are getting more and more of these crap endings. Every director/writer now thinks they can pull it off because  well  Fight Club did it and it made a lot of money. So we get movies like The Machinist  Secret Window  Identity  and this movie (just to name a few).,negative
"François Traffaut's Mississippi Siren had an unconvincing plot. The screenplay required too much elasticity in suspension of disbelief. The plot went at a glacial pace. It started off in an interesting setting but soon drifted onto the shoals of melodrama that lacked logic or intelligence. What were the critics thinking? This one is overrated even to be described as a loser. Even Catherine Deneuvue  who charmed in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and Belle Doe Jour, managed to be simply annoying. <br /><br />We rented this movie at the same time as we rented another Traffaut film. We watched this one first  and found it to be so bad that we sent the other one back unseen at the same time.",negative
"I'm trying to find something of value here. The best I can muster is that Truffaut wanted to make a movie as tedious  painful  puerile  annoying  illogical  and brainless as the experience of being in love. If that was his goal  then he succeeded  but the solution to his exercise is really a drag to watch.<br /><br />There is one scene that screams for a spoof: Belmondo compares the features of Deneuve's face to the features in a landscape . All I could think the whole time was glacier, ice floe, two lonely fishermen wearing Army surplus on a frozen lake in Minnesota.<br /><br />The only other point of interest was the resurrection of Buffoon's theory of climatic determinism. The tropics are presented as paradise  and things get progressively worse as they get colder  hell being Calvinist French Switzerland. That was kind of funny.",negative
this is one of the more poorly made movies I've ever seen. One has to take anything by Truffaut seriously; it's not just some B-movie cranked out by hacks.<br /><br />evidently Truffaut couldn't decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick. and neither could Deneuve  whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all. Among other things  how a woman as beautiful as Deneuve could be a person such as Julie/Marion is simply beyond anyone's ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful. Belmondo's acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as Deneuve's. The cliché ending (which I won't describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake.,negative
I'M BOUT IT(1997)<br /><br />Developed & published by No Limit Films<br /><br />>>Pros: Absolutely none<br /><br />>>Cons: I don't even know where to begin!<br /><br />Plot summary: Master P plays a drug dealer that looks  talks  and acts more like a live-action cartoon character. That's all the plot I got out of this movie.<br /><br />Review: I remember back when I was in the ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called Master P. This movie is so bad  it's not even funny. All the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes  the audio is only audible when music plays  and the movie looks like it was videotaped off a public access channel. Luckily  I didn't buy this film like all my other inner-city degenerate classmates.<br /><br />My rating:1 out of 10<br /><br />My verdict: Avoid this video like its a sexually-transmitted disease.,negative
"When I was young  I'd get up early every Saturday morning not to watch cartoons but to turn on the local channel for what was called 'Kung Fu Theatre.' It wasn't as if these films were works of art. It wasn't as if these films all came from China  Japan  Korea  or any country in particular; if the story had to do with fighting  be it swordplay or fisticuffs  and if the fighting didn't resemble much of anything going on in any American gym class  then that was good enough. It wasn't as if they were really even very good. They were just great action flicks with incredibly over-dramatic music where the hero reaped his vengeance over a whole host of bad guys  and then the credits would roll.<br /><br />Sword in the Moon is much like these films of my youth  arguably a bit of a thematic throwback given a welcome twist by muddying the characters up enough that it becomes increasingly difficult to tell the bad guys from the good.<br /><br />Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as 'the human butcher.' He kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun Dynasty  the chief bodyguard of an Emperor who spared his life and the life of his men in exchange for his service. However  an equally merciless rebel and his lovely sidekick appear in the countryside and start murdering imperial ministers  and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kill them. His task becomes one of personal discovery when he learns that the two rebels are Choi (a friend from his past) and his former love  Shi Yeong.<br /><br />Sadly  Sword doesn't have much to distinguish itself from other action films. Some stunning cinematography is nearly entirely wasted on shoddy editing with portions of the film put together so loosely its hard to believe that what inevitably made it to the film was what anyone intended. While the atmosphere and story tend to gravitate toward a dark mood  the tone is almost sacrificed to the never-ending parade of flashbacks as each of the main characters is given a healthy story arc. What should've been a quick and easy action film gets weighed down by far too much personal baggage  and the film suffers as a result.<br /><br />I've read that this film marks Korea's first real foray into the world of art-house action pieces along the likes of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Next time  I'd strongly suggest that the producers stick with a little more 'martial' and a little less 'art.'",negative
This is a pale imitation of 'Officer and a Gentleman.' There is NO chemistry between Kutcher and the unknown woman who plays his love interest. The dialog is wooden  the situations hackneyed. It's too long and the climax is anti-climactic(!). I love the USCG  its men and women are fearless and tough. The action scenes are awesome  but this movie doesn't do much for recruiting  I fear. The script is formulaic  but confusing. Kutcher's character is trying to redeem himself for an accident that wasn't his fault? Costner's is raging against the dying of the light  but why? His 'conflict' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle. I saw this sneak preview for free and certainly felt I got my money's worth.,negative
The success of the original French Emmanuelle series (I've only watched the first  which wasn't too bad considering) led to a spate of imitations; the Italian counterpart  which even changed the race of its heroine  was clearly less polished and more exploitative - descending more and more into vulgarity as the series went along. Incredibly  there were 16 Black Emanuelle films in total  with the heroine even having the spelling of her name changed to avoid copyright issues!! Still  Laura Gemser - the titular object of desire - became almost as much of an icon as the original Emmanuelle  Sylvia Kristel (although  personally  she's too skinny for my tastes)! Here she's even billed as Emanuelle rather than with her real name - with the director  likewise  becoming Albert Thomas! <br /><br />In itself  the film offers little of interest: as a matter of fact  one would do best to approach it as a travelogue with some decent footage of the African wildlife. With respect to the sex scenes  I don't know how complete the version I watched was but  while there was a lot of nudity  none of it was very explicit - or even titillating (the scene that came closest  perhaps  was when Gemser - who works as a photographer - and her companion Karin Schubert turn the camera on each other  naturally sans clothes  in the middle of the jungle)! The film also features an artist made up to look like Salvador Dali but  mercifully perhaps  his scenes do not take much of the running time. The score by Nico Fidenco is typically bland 70s pop and  really  nothing to write home about.,negative
"Her bit-part as a masseuse  in the lurid sequel to the original 'Emmannuelle'  evidently gave someone the bright idea of putting a spanner in the works of the French soft-core series' gambit by inverting the Caucasian carnality and casting Javan stunner Gemser in a leading role in this  the rather tame first of a series of sexploiters that became increasingly depraved as sleazier directors took on in-name-only sequels.<br /><br />Someone (and surely not the English-language over-haulers Warner?) was also anticipating an 'A Star Is Born' type meteoric rise out the results  judging by the way the actress is credited merely with the eponymous moniker of the on-screen heroine  albeit with a couple of consonants sacrificed as insurance against litigation.<br /><br />Gemser's tenure in the series saw her as an 'intrepid' photographer  allowing of course for all manner of subsequent globe-trotting adventures. But  whilst she may well have been one the very most beautiful actresses on the screen at that time  any thespian talent that may have been there to discern becomes mired in the same sort of unfeasibly facile cogitation (I have to confess that since I've been in Africa, I find white skin less appealing...) that was to be found in the French films.<br /><br />And in this particular entry  much to the consternation of the raincoat brigade the essence of on-screen carnality is as much to be found in puerile symbolism (pumping engine pistons!) as it is in prosaic couplings - although naturally these include generous dollops of 'exploratory' lesbianism. Connoiseurs of kitsch are however guaranteed a continuous stream of aural delights  what with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as I do nothing to be a perfect black, she does everything to be a perfect white.",negative
Some may go for a film like this but I most assuredly did not. A college professor  David Norwell  suddenly gets a yen for adoption. He pretty much takes the first child offered  a bad choice named Adam. As it turns out Adam doesn't have both oars in the water which  almost immediately  causes untold stress and turmoil for Dr. Norwell. This sob story drolly played out with one problem after another  all centered around Adam's inabilities and seizures. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained. Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out. Personally  I think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack. Bypass this yawner.,negative
This movie is over hyped!! I am sad to say that I manage to watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and anything beyond that  I will have to force myself real hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. It's totally stupid and very fake. The robot in the movie looks like a man wearing those steel suit and the acting is really bad especially the one playing the character Alien.He is totally annoying!! Don't waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Gen-X Cops. I'd rather sleep or spend my money on some other things rather than watching this movie. 1 out of 10. If possible I'd give 0.,negative
I saw this movie on VHS some time ago (27 Jan 2003)  just because of the name of Paul Rudd on the cover. I liked his performance in `The Object of My Affection' very much and I really expected a good work. However  I found this film a complete mess. The story has a very confused screenplay and the characters are not well developed. Further  the low-budget special effects do not help much. I do not know the previous generation of Gen-Y Cops  but this next generation is not good. I do not recall exactly why I gave this grade (and I do not intent to see this movie again)  but my vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil) : `Gen-Y Cops A Nova Geração' (`Gen-Y Cops The Next Generation'),negative
I somehow managed to make it all the way through this movie  but was dumbfounded by the complete lack of entertainment delivered. My friends and I are fans of HK film  but WOW. This movie has it all  and by all I mean everything a movie shouldn't have. Underdeveloped and stereotyped characters  way over-the-top overacting  cheesy special effects  talking robots  no less than 20 double-foot jumpkicks  impossible situations  unfunny gags and jokes  elementary school premise  mindless killings  and too-long running time for the material. Throw in the fact that Gen-X Cops was a decent film and this movie becomes even harder to bear. Quite simply  if you're entertaining the idea of watching this film...don't.,negative
This film is really a big piece of trash trying to make itself look like a Hollywood production.Poor story outline(stupid robot story)...ultra bad acting by untalented pop idols...and they are trying toFIGHT!!!My goodness...those miserable actors uses wires to make them look like they are good fighters...:(and I hate that arrogant Edison Chen...the worst actor I have ever seen!!!I will never touch his movies again.AVOID this movie at all costs!!!I wanted to give it a negative value out of ten...not even worth a 0/10.,negative
Exceptionally silly actioner with braindead leads in a story which would have suited a fill-in issue of Spiderman. The action sequences never really flow as they should  leaving some cool bits orphaned in a sea of sound and fury  signifying nothing. I really wonder how they'll release this one in the West. Sam Lee overacts like crazy  newcomer Edison Chan doesn't display any acting talent yet. The robot is clunky and not very impressive  and the CGI effects (though done by US sfx-people) are ridiculous  totally destroying any remaining suspension of disbelief. I am NOT looking forward to Gen-Z Cops...,negative
I usually enjoy watching Laurel and Hardy  but this is obviously one of the films they made while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team.<br /><br />The plot is all too simple  and is mainly based on one joke; how strange kilts and Scotsmen are. And that's all. Okay  there are some other jokes  but I didn't find them very funny at all; they are outdated and (I guess) were not very entertaining when the movie was first released.<br /><br />Still  the movie has got two of the most charming faces in history  and they make the best out of the awkward story (which I expect was filmed without a proper script) and the scenery is nice to look at. <br /><br />In my opinion  watching this is only worthwhile for Laurel and Hardy fans  other people should stay away from it.,negative
i came across this film on the net by fluke and i was horrified by its content of vivid abuse violence and torture scenes. it was a relief to know it was not real after reading the comments. what dangerously sick animals of a person make something like this and for what purpose goes beyond belief. i was even more shocked to see people appraising the film in the comments section of this site. this is a extremely disturbing film indeed which could change your life forever. the people behind this should be bought to justice asap. today they shown a girl getting raped and butchered on screen tomorrow it could be a child. even its fake or not its very very deathly disturbing nauseating indeed.,negative
just watched this film and it actually made me want to write my first comment on IMDb.com  even though i've been a user for more than 9 years. the reason that i watched this  is because i like splatter films and sometimes i like to test my limits and see what actually still shocks me. first of all  the gore in this film didn't shock me  not even the idea that someone came up with this and made it into a film - what really shocked me  is that there seems to be a market for this kind of crap. don't get me wrong - i'm all against censorship  but this film seems to me like it was made for some kind of fetish crowd that seems to get off on this type of sh*t.it didn't give you that same kind of disgust and guilt that one felt after watching films like august underground. that film is terrible to watch  but at least you get the feeling that the filmmakers want to show you how disgusting violence is. in the case of niku daruma  it seems like it was made strictly to arouse people. i prefer films that shock  because they are well done and thought through  like Gaspar Noe's films  or Takashi Miike's  or Funny Games or Man Bites Dog - those films will stick with you for a while. this film i will have forgotten by tomorrow  and the only thing that will stick with me  is the thought  that somewhere out there  there are people getting aroused by watching this sh*t. if you read this  please check yourself into the next hospital or shoot yourself - this of course does not apply to gore hounds  who just love splatter. you're cool! peace,negative
Not near as well made as the Guinea Pig flicks it was inspired by (Flowers of Flesh and Blood or Devil's Experiment) and not conveying any real philosophy  this video feature  which is barely feature length  adds hardcore sex (with mosaic censoring) to its inspiration. The special make-up effects  which include stomach slitting and disembowelment  are pretty good  if overlit. The amateur feel of the production is a distraction. It all looks cheap and lazy. The lighting is harsh and the sound and editing are sloppy. The simple story involves a porno actress who ends up starring in a real snuff movie. Just when she gets tired of being abused  the real abuse begins. In the film's hero scene  an actor cuts the woman's stomach open in graphic close-up  stuffs his member inside it  and proceeds to do his thing. I didn't find Psycho - The Snuff Reels shocking. On the contrary  I found it to be a desperate attempt by amateurs to one-up Guinea Pig and its bloody ilk. Interestingly  this was distributed by Aroma  a leading fetish producer.,negative
This movie just didn't do it for me. I like horror and splatter movies but this one has very little to do with horror. The effects are cheap and when they chop of one of her feet it looks so fake. The same goes for the other effects like the tongue torture and the gut sex. They could have spent of few extra bucks on the effects.<br /><br />With lots of sex (with pixelization as in all Japanese movies) this is just a sick fetish porn and there seems to be a market for sick stuff like this. While bloodier  for me it fits in with titles like Squirmfest / Purge and the Genki series. These movies feature girls eating and playing with every fluid that comes out of your body  eating bugs and fish in a gross way and having sex with all kinds of weird animals  like toads  eels and... One look at the covers will tell horror fans to look elsewhere. No horror here just sick and degrading sex scenes.<br /><br />Horror fans should avoid this one and are better of checking out Guinea Pig2: Flowers of Flesh and Blood or even August Underground Mordum. While these are not great they at least offer a horror experience and Niku Daruma absolutely fails in that department.,negative
Frankie Muniz plays Jason who is a high school student. His biggest problem is his life is built on small or big lies that puts him into trouble most times. However  he cannot escape from his teacher and he finishes his creative writing homework just before its deadline. While he is biking fast to hand his homework to the teacher  he crushes into a car. As he explains the situation to grumpy man(Giamatti) in the car  he gives him a lift to his school. But the problem is Jason leaves his homework in the car  the other way of saying this is Marty Wolf(Giamatti) steals it.<br /><br />After a few months Jason goes to a movie and sees a trailer that takes him aback. Because the story of the movie is based on his homework. He tells that to his parents but of course they don't believe him. Especially his father uses words which insults him. Jason decides to go to LA and find Wolf to tell his father that Jason is not a liar. When Wolf refuses it  Jason takes action and ruins his life.<br /><br />This is the short story of the Big Fat Liar. Well  as a kids movie it might be a light hearted one but there are some errors that even could would ask if that is possible. Such as  having such a small amount of money and going to LA with a friend to sort the problem out  having access to this cinema producer's highly protected house and office  setting up a telecommunications system overnight.Does it seem believable? It does not. Well this is a kids movie but kids are not that gullible.<br /><br />Big Fat Liar offers some little pleasure to its target audience. Unfortunately  I am not a big fat liar to say that this is a good movie. ** out of *****,negative
Few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as Fire has. The movie is pretentious garbage. It does not achieve anything at an artistic level. The only thing it managed to receive is a ban in India. If only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy  the ban would have been more justifiable.<br /><br />Now that I've got my distress out of my system  I am more able to analyse the movie: <br /><br />* From the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in English. The director  of course  did not make the movie for an Indian audience; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it. Watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect English is too unreal to be true.<br /><br />* Next we get regular glimpses into Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie. I'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story. I felt that the surrealism was lost.<br /><br />* The love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement. In any case  they do not achieve either of the two.<br /><br />* The names chosen for the women  Radha and Sita  are names of Hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences. However  since the film wasn't meant for Indian audiences in the first place  the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal  which is absurd.<br /><br />* The quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled. A better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject.<br /><br />* The acting felt wooden although Nandita Das brought some life into the role  the others were wasted. I always thought that Shabana Azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film. The male leads were outright rubbish.<br /><br />In case you are a fan of Earth and wish to see more of the director  stay away from this one. Please.,negative
I suppose I can see why critics give this film two out five stars  it isn't fantastic  but I think it is worth a look  from director Shawn Levy (Cheaper by the Dozen  Night at the Museum). Basically 14-year-old Jason Shepherd (Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz) is often lying to his parents and teachers  and his teacher warns him that if he doesn't do his creative writing  he will fail his whole semester and have to repeat the grade during summer. So he completes his work  but getting a lift from Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti)  who hit him on the way to school  he manages to leave his paper with the story Big Fat Liar in the car. He finds out from a movie trailer that Marty stole his paper and is turning it into a major movie  so he and his best friend Kaylee (She's the Man's Amanda Bynes) are on a mission to prove Jason is for once telling the truth. Marty of course is too nasty and smug to give Jason's father Harry (Michael Bryan French) a phone call  and he evens burns the Big Fat Liar paper. So now Jason and Kaylee are determined to make Marty's life as hellish as possible  until he agrees to call Jason's Dad. They put blue dye in his swimming pool  and orange hair dye in his shampoo  and much more naughty pranks creating chaos for Marty's career. There is the obvious point when Jason looks like he wants to give up  but don't worry  all characters that despise Marty help out in the final operation  and with Jason's parents coming  he wants to finally prove his truthfulness  and boy does he deliver  big style. Also starring Amanda Detmer as Monty Kirkham  Lee Majors as Vince  Donald Adeosun Faison as Frank Jackson  Sandra Oh as Mrs. Phyllis Caldwell  Russell Hornsby as Marcus Duncan  Christine Tucci as Carol Shepherd and American Pie's John Cho as Dustin 'Dusty' Wong. Muniz is likable  Byrnes proves a very surprisingly talented support  and even though he is wasting his time and talent a little  Giamatti is great at being nasty. It is a kids film  so if it seems corny  cheesy or predictable  just keep that in mind  and try to enjoy the performances and slapstick. Okay!,negative
Shakespeare would have been outraged. The writers mutilated Shakespeare's amazing work. Ariel is the only believable acting performance. The African voodoo  secluded swamp  and Gator Man character make the movie a mockery of Shakespeare's true Tempest. <br /><br />Don't waste your eye-sight on this movie.,negative
I keep waiting for Peter Fonda to start acting. For someone who comes from such a talented family  it's a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fonda trying to play someone else. And  that's the good news in this disappointing dog of an adaptation of The Tempest. A string of loosely connected ideas that only suggest a relationship with the Bard's great play is what we're served. The setting is the Civil War and Prospero's (here Guideon's) evil brother looks like an 1890's melodrama villain  complete with Snidely Whiplash moustache. I kept waiting for him to go Uh ha hah! which would have been a high point in this dreary presentation. None of the supporting cast was memoriable and Peter Fonda's lack of expression and wooden body movements made the lackadaisical story drag on and on. <br /><br />The Tempest is the Bard's statement about the rage of man's unjust treatment of man. The only believable character was the Gator man  the Caliban counterpart. The transferrence to the swamp had possibilities but the Civil War setting just didn't make it. All in all  a very disappointing production. I saw it on video and would advise  if you want a Willy Shakespeare fix  save your money on this one. Rent something else  like Branagh's Much Ado about Nothing  or Kevin Kline in Midsummer's Night Dream.,negative
Jack Bender's The Tempest is an adaption of Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the time of the American civil war. He includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in wartimes.<br /><br />Prospero  re-named Gideon Prosper is not the Duke of Milan but a landowner in Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from the female slave Mambo Azaleigh. He saves her son Ariel  who thus accompanies him into his exile. The island is not situated on the sea but in a swamp near the banks of the Mississippi. There lives an Alligator hunter  a so-called Gator-Man  who later tries to rape Prospero's daughter Miranda. During the time of the civil war  Ariel wants to join the Union troops to help fighting against slavery. Prospero does not care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antony. When Antony and his bookkeeper Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river  Prospero raises a storm. The Union soldier Frederick gets lost in the swamp and finally comes to the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other but Prospero won't accept that. Meanwhile  Ariel transformed into a raven by Prospero  finds out that Antony has feigned to ally with the Union but plans to betray them. Antony and Gonzo meet Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel but Prospero freeze them and helps the Union defeat the Southern army. In the end Ariel is free  Frederick and Miranda are bound to marry  Prospero returns to the plantation and Gator Man gets back the island.<br /><br />Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper powerfully and convincingly while the character of Antony stays rather flat. It was no bad idea to perform the Tempest before the background of the civil war but perhaps the director has risked too much. In some parts the story seems constructed or comical. Gator Man for example does just appear without any explanation. That it needs a kidnapping to bring Prospero to his mind and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human but only made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero's original authority and wisdom is not made clear.<br /><br />-------------End of Part 1----------------------------,negative
The (DVD)movie The Tempest  directed by Jack Bender  was published in 2001. It didn't make its way to German cinemas and neither the director or an actor were able to receive an important award for this movie. The movie refers to the Shakespearean play The Tempest which was published at the end of the 16th century. The director tried to create an modern version of this play  but failed. At the beginning of the movie the plantation owner Prosper gets in a conflict with his brother Antonio about the treatment of their slaves. Antonio sets his brother a trip and tries to kill him but with the help of a witch  Prosper is able to escape and flees with his daughter and a slave called Ariel to a small island nearby the Mississippi river. For over twelve years he has lived isolated on this island  till a lucky chance enables him to take revenge on his brother....If Prosper will be lucky you have to find out by yourself.<br /><br />In my opinion this film is really a bad try to create a modern version of the original play by William Shakespeare. The story of the movie is confusing as well as the characters. Prosper doesn't have the same powers as in the tempest..... END OF PART I,negative
I tried to watch this adaptation  but it was just so awful I couldn't torture myself like that. The performances were quite sub-par  with the exception of Ariel. Fonda was way over the top in a role that should be handled with some subtlety. I have studied Shakespeare and seen many adaptations  and this is  by far  the worst one I have ever seen. I have to wonder why on Earth someone made this film. Shakespeare can  and has been  beautifully adapted in many cases. This is not one of them. If you must watch this film  may I suggest a drinking game? Take a drink every time they go off book from the original idea and two drinks every time Fonda overacts. You should be quite drunk in a very short time.,negative
"This film fails on every count. For a start it is pretentious  striving to be significant and failing miserably. The script was banal in the extreme  nobody at any time said anything remotely interesting. It was impossible to care about any of the characters. Knightly was a self-regarding waste of time whilst Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. The bit about the soldier who went off to war was a cliché even before the film Atonement used it. The use of the Second World War as a backdrop was in itself a cliché...the bombs  the sheltering in tube stations etc...employed to import a bit of much-needed drama. Why anybody thought for a moment that this film was worth making is quite beyond my comprehension. It was yet another case of let's get the costumes looking authentic, never mind about the story, the script or the acting!",negative
My god...i have not seen such an awful movie in a long...long time...saw it last night and wanted to leave after 20 minutes...keira knightley tries really really hard in this one  but she cant handle it..dropped her accent every once in a while and didn't have the charisma to fill the role...sienna millers acting gets you to a point where you start to ask yourself: Has she ever had acting lessons? judging by the edge of love shes never been to acting class  but should consider to go in the near future...they both look really pretty..maybe thats what they should focus on in their future career..if they can be actresses everybody can!,negative
This film is about the complicated friendship  romance and deceit between two men and two women during the World War II.<br /><br />A lot of effort has been put to make The Edge of Lovelook the right period. However  I find this effort too excessive  particularly in terms of the tone of the colours. Most of the first half of the film is processed so much to have a strong bluish tone. It's hard to make out who's who in this tone.<br /><br />Another detrimental point is the fancy use of image splitting lens. There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing  such as three Keira Knightley smiling face or four pairs of arms in embrace. That simply makes the film confusing and hard to follow  instead of being artistic.<br /><br />As for the plot  it is plain boring. The way the story unfolds is not engaging at all. Sienna Miller's unstable character is annoying. In fact all the main characters are annoying and unlikeable. Keira Knightley's accent is impossible to understand  making it a further impediment to understanding the plot.<br /><br />I strongly advise avoiding The Edge of Love  unless you watch a film only to appreciate great costumes  nice sets and lighting.,negative
For years  I've been a big fan of Park's work and Old boy is one of my all-times favorite.<br /><br />With lots of expectation I rented this movie  only to find the worst movie I've watched in awhile. It's not a proper horror movie; there's no suspense in it and even the light part is so lame  that I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.<br /><br />I introduced my younger brother to Chan-Wook Park and what a disappointment he got from this. For me  an idol has fallen.<br /><br />If you loved movies like Old boy  the Mr & Lady Vengeance or even his short films on Three extremes  don't waste your time  the film's not worth it.,negative
I just got done watching The Edge of Love (by the way  this is one of the worst titles so far this year) and it felt like a chore. Watching Keira Knightly's unlikable  skeleton-looking character made me cringe even more throughout the coarse of the film.<br /><br />It took me four nights to watch this it was so boring. The only good thing about it was Cillian Murphy. He's always good/believable and is severely under looked in many films. This  however  was just not good enough for him.<br /><br />Apart from the unlikable characters  boring storyline  the plot was also emotionally unsatisfying. I felt like I spent my time watching this for nothing (which I did). I should have done the smart thing and turned it off  but I kept it on out of respect for Cillian Murphy and the great cinematography.,negative
i can't believe how dumb this movie truly is. the storyline (written by keira knightley's mother) is what ruins the movie to the extreme. it is straight out dull  absurd  and makes absolutely no sense whatsoever...<br /><br />this movie lagged so bad for most of it  especially at the beginning. the story just kept going on and on about their everyday flirts with each other  often times seeming like a threesome. in this movie  you have an annoying deadbeat couple (the poet and his wife) who are complete total drunks from the start. the wife sleeps around with other men to make ends meet  while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boos and women. the wife  who waaayyyyyy too quickly becomes friends with his former childhood lover (played by keira) suddenly gets jealous  knowing full well that the two were lovers since they were kids. something doesn't seem right here....i mean  come on... get with the program lady! what'd you expect.<br /><br />bottom line is: former lovers meet again with new wife embracing it  then gets jealous  then former woman lover gets married and her husband gets jealous  bombards the crazy drunk couple's home  crazy husband calls police  and they end up going to court for the man's attempted murder charges. that's it summed up in a nutshell...<br /><br />this movie had it's moments such as the quality and good acting by cillian murphy  but other than that  i cannot believe i watched it... i complained about it during the movie and some family members watching it with me fell asleep. i decided to give it a chance and i should have stuck to my first instincts.,negative
"This movie is so dull I spent half of it on IMDb while it was open in another tab on Netflix trying to find out if anyone thought it was one of the more boring  ponderous  gimmicky films they've ever seen. A warning: I actually could not finish it  so these are my impressions up to minute 54.<br /><br />Keira Knightly gets loads of screen time. As others have mentioned  her mother penned the script (perhaps during some sort of drug-induced stupor wherein utter inanities and emotionless statements about emotions sounded like interesting dialogue) and it seems that the film is a showcase for Knightly. Oops! Although I agree she is lovely (with her teeth unexposed...her barred teeth cause me anxiety and fear) I found her reactions forced and poorly timed. As in  William or Dylan does something cute...pause...HAHAHA from K with dimples and a playful arm jab. Like a minute too late. What? And she cannot match Cillian Murphy's intensity. He somehow manages to really look at her and look as though he is fascinated by her and falling in love with her whereas she seems totally disconnected  almost like she is interacting with a mirror. That must be torture  acting opposite someone who isn't delivering the same level of energy as you. Know what else is torture? This movie.<br /><br />Knightly does look stunning during her cyclical I've got 1940s pin curls and a hot dress. Watch me sing! shots  but what's the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she talks it's bizarre  Ooow, Mehster Deelan. Whur eer ya going? This makes me confused because the accent is so mixed up and unauthentic  yet so thick at times I have no idea what she's saying (or maybe fell asleep). If no one knows who Vera was or cares  or few do  was it so important to give her this supposed Welsh accent? It distracts from all the rest of the action (just kidding there).<br /><br />This movie seems like someone dreamed a movie  maybe after reading a little Dylan Thomas before bed. But instead of adapting to the waking world was like  Man, that dream was so interesting and tried to replicate it. Then someone else cautioned  Your script needs work. Nothing that happens furthers a story or creates necessity and the writer is all  But that's the way I dreamed it! It's like the rambling fantasy of a child  one of those wild and meandering yarns they spin to get your attention. And THEN William went to a war and then Vera had a baby and then some blond chick drank too much and there were so many airplanes and pin curls and everyone had ruby red lips and...<br /><br />As for the Dylan Thomas character (so bland that's all I can call him)  why didn't he have any lines in this goofy biopic? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and roll around with Sienna Miller  who is so wild and artistic she'll do a cartwheel in public! Get outta here  you crazy poets! (I realize she is not a poet  but she and Thomas are like this one nauseating unit of crazy guys havin crazy times  like a lukewarm Sailor and Lula from Wild at Heart.) Someone asks in the message board if they should buy this film. I say do it. Leave it on your shelf and only utilize it as a weapon to narcotize children  the elderly  or lingering house guests.<br /><br />P.S. to Murphy's character...when someone asks if you were in the sh** you can say yes  because your war scenes appear to have been shot at a landfill.",negative
After I saw this I concluded that it was most likely a chick flick; afterward I found out that Keira's mother wrote the screenplay so that pretty much confirmed it. However  a chick flick can have some appeal to men; this one does not and really seems not to appeal that well either to women (looking at the dismal box office receipts). One item that I believe both genders agree upon is the stupidity of the the scene  in the movie  whereby an analogy is made between the pain of childbirth to the pain of a limb being amputated w/o anesthesia. Though men do not undergo the pain of childbirth we understand that it is a painful process; yet it is a natural pain whereas an amputation certainly is not! Women understand this even better. I suspect some woman was trying to make a feminist statement that is in poor taste. In fact  a lot of things in this movie are in very poor taste. Though movies nowadays are known for having poor taste this one really excels in that department. This could have been a good movie that shows the struggles of Dylan Thomas during WWII; and how strong the sentiment was against men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the military then. Keira's screen writing mother tries to show how this sentiment was used against Dylan but really muddles this. Instead we get a chick flick about how two young mothers bond together; sort of. In a way. Perhaps. Somehow. Of note is the fact that a soldier (the husband of the friend of Dylan's wife) is sent back home after serving in combat; yet it is unclear if the war has ended!! A lot of things about this movie are similarly unclear; and though I have stated that already I will do so again as it seems to be the central motif of this mess.,negative
An odd  willfully skewed biopic of Dyan Thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead we have to endure a raw character exposée seen through the prism of his proto-bigamous relationship with wife (Sienna Miller) and childhood love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with sufficient charm to inoculate us against his otherwise repellent self-interest and Cillian Murphy makes up the persistently tense lovetet.<br /><br />The film never seems to decide on where it's going. There's no arc so much as a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems much more interested in his two female leads (who wouldn't!?) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them. Miller is the choice of the two (I found Knightley competent at best but then I have never found her sympathetic) but they both offer dreadfully inconsistent Welsh accents. Other funny decisions include too much for the inconsequential character of William (Murphy)  arty production (eg double crossfades) that is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old chestnut act of period footage which doesn't blend. 4/10,negative
This movie is actually so poor in its desperate attempts at being feel good and casual it really made me embarrassed watching it. I can't imagine how the inner circle of Norwegian celebs and press must have felt trying to pretend to like it at the star-packed premiere. Its great media reviews is a sickening example of how ridiculously small and inbred the Norwegian media scene is. Had a foreign film of this quality reached the silver screen it would have gotten the rain of rotten tomatoes it truly deserves.<br /><br />The combination of literally amateur actors  home-made style visual effects  awkward dialogue  painfully idle attempts at working class humour and the overly cozy and meaningless plot  really makes this a movie of rock bottom quality. Stay away.,negative
This is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen  probably only surpassed by the dreadful and utterly meaningless Blueberry. How can Harald Zwart even have put his name on this crap. I'm feeling every ounce of respect I had for him waning fast.<br /><br />So what is it about this film that makes it so poor? Is it the story? Yes. Is it the actors? Yes. It it the whole look and feel of the movie? Yes.<br /><br />To start off with the story  my god!It's about as cliché-ridden and predictable as what you would expect from a drunk 14-year old who is late writing his/her paper on What I did this summer. The feel-good vibe the makers try to achieve just completely drown as we suffer through yet another embarrassing turn to the story.<br /><br />The actors are amateurs  I know  and thus we cannot expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors. But for this to work  the characters HAVE to be charming and/or funny (preferably both)  so that the viewers don't mind the cheeky acting  or perhaps it even adds to the characters. In this case  not even close baby! You start off disliking the characters mildly  and by the end of the film (I think it's about 90 minutes long  although it feels like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt somebody to get your mind of these annoying stupid guys! It should be impossible to find this movie's attempt at humor successful unless you're actually yourself like these stupid hickeys. Their before mentioned lack of talent and credibility as far as acting goes  only makes the foolish and overly simple scenes fall harder to the ground. Even the family of the people involved will have a hard time finding this anything but very  very embarrassing (I'd rather have my sister make a fool of herself on American Idol).<br /><br />Finally  why cram in a bunch of misplaced Norwegian celebrities? They look even more out of place than the actors  if this is possible. These celebrity cameos just add to the cheap feeling of the film and is in itself a pretty see-through shot in the dark at trying to improve something broken even before inception.<br /><br />I cannot even begin to stress how much I'd rather watch paint dry than ever watch this movie again...,negative
I think I watched a highly edited version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected - based on the other reviews that I have heard.<br /><br />Other than 1. being written by the same person who wrote the original Emmanuelle (1974)  Emmanuelle Arsan  2. the lead character being a sexually free spirit  and 3. being set in the exotic locale of Asia  Laure doesn't have the same flair as its predecessor.<br /><br />I just found this film way too talky with philosophical topics that I'm really not that interested in  i.e. the voyeuristic  open relationship between Laure and Nick  I'm just happy with whatever brings her pleasure...something along those lines. I cannot relate to this mentality and the film/characters don't really shed any light.<br /><br />The second half about finding the Mara tribe just seemed as though it were a completely separate film. One that I didn't care for. By that time  I was just hoping that it would turn into a porn so that at least it would keep my interest.<br /><br />Maybe I just didn't get it.<br /><br />I'll leave it at that.,negative
There were so many classic movies that were made where the leading people were out-and- out liars and yet they are made to look good. I never bought into that stuff. The screwball comedies were full of that stuff and so were a lot of the Fred Astaire films.<br /><br />Here  Barbara Stanwyck plays a famous country magazine writer who has been lying to the public for years  and feels she has to keep lying to keep her persona (and her job). She even lies to a guy about getting married  another topic that was always trivialized in classic films.<br /><br />She's a New York City woman who pretends she's a great cook and someone who knows how to handle babies  etc. Obviously she knows nothing and the lies pile up so fast you lose track. I guess all of that is supposed to be funny because lessons are learned in the end and true love prevails  etc. etc. Please pass the barf bag.<br /><br />Most of this film is NOT funny. Stanwyck was far better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan  well  pass the bag again.,negative
Oh God! It could be a very interesting film and in fact it is. I would have like to give it a 5 but i give a 2 for my vote. Why? I saw it in a theatre! See this film on DVD or on TV! The shooting is really really POOR!!!!! It keeps shaking all the time  in a completely tasteless framing!<br /><br />Its really painful to see this very interesting film in a cinema. You got quickly seasick and you have to make some huge effort not to puke on your neighbor 's seat! <br /><br />It's really a shame 'cos  the story is edited in a non-linear way which is quite rare (and a very good idea!) for a documentary. <br /><br />Watch this at home!,negative
As noted in other comments here  the camera-work is laughably bad. I am tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7-year-old  but that would be mean -- to 7-year-olds.<br /><br />Okay  but what about the subject? I was looking for some insight into the state of the wine industry worldwide  you know  Mondovino. What the film is about is a very narrow view of one intrigue in that world: the struggle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries that they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narration that would put the whole deal into context  so we are left with the selective process of the director and the interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama. There's no shortage of despicable characters  or even despicable dogs  in sight. There is a shortage of evenhandedness  however. <br /><br />Is the director a Marxist? I wondered as I tried to maintain some semblance of focus as the camera dipped  swerved  zoomed in a chaotic flourish. Small grower in France: good. Huge grower in USA: very  very bad. Forget about the hundreds of small wineries throughout North America  Australia  and South America. There is a dead horse to beat here for over two hours.<br /><br />To learn about the intrigue more  you are better off reading about it elsewhere. And you will be able to sample your favorite wine without feeling sick while doing so.<br /><br />I suggest a new award at Cannes for Best America-bashing Diatribe.,negative
Was it really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in a documentary. And why all the silly dog scenes  and then repetition of all the same silly dog scenes? This film starts with a great promise - to expose the international politics and the business of wine. It got off to a great start and included all the right characters. But the production is a mess. Points started and developed most of the way  then never finished or left with dangling ends. Very poor and disorienting camera work and editing. They should have used subtitles for the British mumbler from Christie's.<br /><br />Too much fluff and not enough fact for a documentary.<br /><br />Probably honored at Cannes because of the US bashing (although in my opinion there was too little of it).<br /><br />We left at the 2:00 hour mark - I have no idea how much longer it ran on.,negative
"Might end up being the biggest disappointment that I will see in 2009. I seem to be the rare person who disliked Park's Oldboy  but I think that his Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance are among the best films I've seen in the 2000's decade. Therefore  I really was looking forward to see this  especially as it got such positive reviews. Instead  I found the film clichéd  and broke little  if any new ground to the vampire genre. And while I can appreciate a bit of gallows humor in movies like this  I felt Park did this at very inopportune times.<br /><br />Others have compared/contrasted this to Let the Right One In, and I have to say that Let the Right One In was far superior to this one  and was a fresh take on the vampire genre. Sadly  Park's take was a tired one.",negative
I've heard people compare this movie to Sideways. How this comparison was made  I'll never guess because this movie was in no way comparable to Sideways.<br /><br />These 2 films were as different as Star Wars and the Thornbirds. The only thing they had in common at all was they both had wine as a subject.<br /><br />Though the interviews in this documentary were semi-interesting  they were ruined by the absolute worst camera work ever...attempted. I've never seen worse camera work in my life and I'm comparing it to home videos accidentally taken by 5 year olds.<br /><br />I give this two stars  ONLY for the interesting interviews with French wine types and for showing how pushy and corrupt the American wine companies are (Aren't all companies pushy and corrupt?) I'd give it -10 stars (Yes  that's NEGATIVE 10) for the deplorable  terrible  horrible  awful  VERTIGO-INDUCING  5-year-old-could-do-better camera mess.,negative
i was looking forward to this  and to be honest there were some bright spots  but it would have worked better if it had concentrated on one story rather than shooting all over the world. The many dogs were a lot of fun but i got bored of the wine fascists pompously whining (;-)) on about their achievements.<br /><br />I felt it would have worked better as an hour long TV documentary  concentrating on one of the many different issues it explored. The most interesting being the french town near montpelier fighting off a an American wine company's campaign to get rid of the historic forests. A socialist mayor agreed to a deal  a nicely timed election arrived  and a communist mayor was elected  who turned it down  much to the exasperation of the American wine execs...<br /><br />hopefully the director's cut will be shorter than the original..,negative
The filmmakers try to paint the influence of the Mondovis and Robert Parker as a travesty on par with the German occupation of France and the reign of Fascism. But they never find a victim in this film. We hear wine makers  critics and distributors bemoan that while the wine industry grows it becomes increasingly homogeneous. But the film never makes a case that this has resulted in the loss of any good wine or exploitation of any person or culture other than naive Wine Spectator readers with lots of cash. If they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a dull wine  so be it.<br /><br />If this were a film about the diamond trade  where the DeBeers corporation's market domination results in human suffering  the muckraking style might have been appropriate. But as it is it just comes off as anti-American  anti-modernization and anti-capitalist. Had the filmmakers been around in the 1870s they most likely would have protested the grafting of American vines in the effort to save French wine.,negative
The film is annoying.<br /><br />Technically  there are too many times you see unfocused and very roughly edited scenes. One could easily get a cleaner film using a decent amateur camera and 100$ video editing software. Down to earth  man on the street doesn't mean sloppy editing. Unfocused scenes that don't contain important statement should have been deleted. The same goes for making sure that the object's head/hand/others stay in the frame. My 8 years old son knows that by now.<br /><br />The film is way too long. The main point (anti globalization) is understood after 30 minutes  why bother with all the rest. After the interview with James Suckling I pressed the stop button. What a waist of time.<br /><br />The main theme just doesn't work for me anymore. I've seen too many small wineries which produce mediocre  commercialized wines and many big wineries that produce great and unique wines. The movie identifies the small producers as the ones that are producing wines with more Identity  or terroir. The bigger ones are accused of producing internationalized or commercialized wines. The film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones. However  the movie hasn't proved this claim. They look at a couple of sporadic examples  tie some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism and provided interviews with key people. Well  did all the small producers spent WWII in the resistance? Is it relevant to see that Parker has a thing with Bulldogs? The movie is very manipulative and unconvincing.,negative
i do not understand at all why this movie received such good grades from critics - - i've seen tens of documentaries (on TV) about the wine world which were much much better when (if) you watch it  please think of two very annoying aspects of mondovino : first  the filming is just awful and terrible and upsetting : to me  it looked like the guy behind the camera just received the material and was playing with it : plenty of zooms (for no purpose other than pushing the button in/out) for instance - - i almost stopped to watch it because of that ! secondly  the interviewer (the director i think) is not really relevant : he looks like and ask questions like a boy scout  not like a journalist  even if the general idea and themes would have been interesting  too bad conclusion: overrated documentary  maybe only for guys who do not know nothing about wine => not recommended at all (2/10),negative
Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It is just that bad. Truly an uneven and unfair portrayal of bad vs. good in the wine world. Did you notice the filmmaker trying any of the wines from the featured protectors of individual wines and terroir. The camera work is dizzying at best while the content may put you to sleep before long. This is not insightful journalism. What I got from this movie was that the filmmaker was trying hard to make a point about the globalism of wine by showing  for example  that the Mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world. Okay  that is a good start. So  how do these wines compare? Does the Mondavi Napa cab taste like their Italian wines. We never find out because no one in the film comments on this. Instead  there is a lot of innuendo about Nazi's and fascism. Well  those things don't grow grapes. Hmmmm.,negative
This film appears to be an exposé of the current trend towards globalization and homogenization in the wine industry. Wineries around the world are more and more either joining large conglomerates (the American producer  Mondavi  in the case of this film) or paying high-priced experts to help them make the perfect wine--and as a result  wines are becoming very standard and predictable. To some  this is a good thing (especially since few can afford to pay $50 or more for an everyday wine) and to others this is horrible as the uniqueness of smaller wineries is disappearing. I truly can understand the concerns of both sides and don't think there is a villain or hero in this business. Sure  good and cheaper wine is a nice thing  but like what's happened with beers (with giants like Unibrew and Anheiser-Busch)  food (McDonalds)  shopping (European shopping malls are almost indistinguishable from American ones) and mega-stores (like Walmart/Asda) are taking away much of the uniqueness of the little guys. So I definitely was ready and willing to listen to these film makers. However  with a product that is almost two and a half hours long AND a general lack of focus  the film simply became too big a chore to watch and I lost interest. An 80-90 minute focused film would have been MUCH more effective--especially since the average viewer is NOT an oenophile (that's the high-brow word for a wine aficionado).<br /><br />On the very positive side  the film makers are smart not to do much talking at all--and simply let those on both sides of the issue do the talking. Plus  the topic is so relevant and timely. However  despite choosing a good style of documentary making  the film simply goes on way  way  way too long and ended up making a very dull film.,negative
An interesting period picec showing us what was amazing in 1938. Gosh  Ma  a fake accident ring suing for $25 000!!! I guess projected into the 21st century it would amount to a lot of money. The acting would amount to pure 21st century ham. Nice to see the president as a hard-working newcomer.,negative
Bloody Birthday opens to a shot of Meadowvale General Hospital. There three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse. A caption informs us that it is now 'Meadowvale  California June 1  1980'. Two teenage lovers  Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) are getting down to business in an open grave. They hear noises and Duke investigates. Both Duke and Annie are murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is baffled and only has the handle of a child's skipping rope that Annie was holding  as a clue. Unfortunately before Sheriff Brody can solve the case his youngest daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) murder him. Just as they are finishing Sheriff Brody off another young boy from their class named Timmy Russel (K.C. Martel) turns up  the three killers are unaware of how much he saw. Soon after the incident Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis in a junkyard. Curtis locks Timmy into an old locker. Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin)  but she doesn't believe him at first. The three children carry on their murder spree. Their strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg) a lovemaking couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbie's older sister Beverly (Julie Brown) are among their victims. Joyce begins to have her suspicions about Debbie  Curtis and Steven which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers?<br /><br />Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt I have an intense dislike for this film. I think it's absolutely awful and doesn't have a single enjoyable aspect to it's 83 minute running time. The script by Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks out Saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children don't have any conscience  so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse? If that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthday's before starting their killing spree? I guess it just suddenly kicks in  right? To it's credit it is reasonably well paced but I still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit through. The film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable  the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as I've mentioned next to no motive is given. It's very silly at times  too. Check out the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing a bowl of water over him! The Sheriff's death is put down to him falling down some steps  yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident aren't going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality  any competent Doctor or Pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds. There isn't a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative. There is some out-of-place looking nudity as Debbie charges 25c to let boys peek through a hole while her sister Beverly strips. There is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen  not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing. The general incompetence continues throughout the film. The whole production is bland and instantly forgettable. The acting is poor throughout  those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore  especially Curtis in his geeky over-sized glasses. I just hate this film really  simple as that. I can't think of a single good thing to say about it. Definitely one to avoid.,negative

He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss  the abyss gazes also into you.<br /><br />Yes  this is from Nietzsche's Aphorism 146 from Beyond Good and Evil. And that's what you find at the start of this movie.<br /><br />If you watch the whole movie  you will doubt if it was the message that the Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to pass on. As the scenes crop up one by one  quite violent and at times puke-raking  the viewer is expected to forget the Nietzsche quote and think otherwise. That to deal with few people you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe who will have the licence to kill anyone  not just writing FIRs (something unworthy of the police to do  as we are made to believe).<br /><br />When TADA was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws  RGV's Satya did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like India. Within a year MCOCA was passed.<br /><br />When real life encounter specialist Daya Nayak 'became a monster on the path of fighting them' and was himself booked by MCOCA  Aab tak Chhappan was made to heed out false impression among the people about this. With it's you have to be a monster to save your nation approach.<br /><br />And people consumed it. No questions raised. Only praises and hopes that they get a Sadhu Agashe in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over. Blood? You can ignore.<br /><br />Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon  we hear voices like India must also similarly attack Pakistan. This movie is made for such psychopaths. If you don't give them this  they will probably die out of boredom and LSD and what not.<br /><br />Hence this game of the passion of hatred.,negative
This movie is not at all like City of God  you might get the same feeling but it isn't  there's no intense shooting nor intense drug scenes  you get the idea. If you ask me I think this film was a waste of time  there are a lot of other films which gives 100 times better meaning and teaching than Wooden Camera. Yes I might be the only one to give a negative comment for this film but it's only in my opinion. It's one of those films where I can get the feeling that I'll be blown away but when the credits start to role my friends and I all gave mutual looks  and we all laughed at how ridiculous this movie was. So to conclude this matter  I advise not to watch it.<br /><br />Personal note - Making Africans talk English was a big mistake. In City of God they used their native language which gave the film much more power and reality.,negative
Don't get me wrong. I really love the arena-martial arts genre  and I get more and more surprised over how many films like this there are out there. This one is one of those  and it's not even close to be one of the best. With Mathias Hues in it  I thought it would be good. He can't save this movie though  and to be honest  he wasn't very good either. Just don't pay attention to what other people say; The fighting scenes in this movie are NOT good at all. I really know what I'm talking about  since I have seen so many movies like this. There are also a bunch of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. I guess they added these only to make the movie last a little bit longer  in addition to manifest the bad guy as uuuuuuh.......bad (like we didn't know that already).,negative
I laughed so much when I saw this film I nearly soiled myself !. Awful acting  laughable effects (super imposed explosions)  and dodgy slow motion fighting.<br /><br />One of the worst films I've ever seen !.,negative
and I still don't know where the hell this movie is going? I mean really  what is this movie about? Is it about demonstrating Sean Connery's complete lack of Arabic? Is it about showing that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warlord then he was a natural to play the role of Ramirez in highlander? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why was there so much sand that was put to so little use? Where was there so much table slapping? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy who he was shooting archery with? Did he realize the man was Japanese? Why was no no credible excuse given for Connery's accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent  whether it be being raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact)  being raised on the bayou in Louisiana (Universal Soldier)  or having a French mother and being raised in Indochina (I cannot even remember the name of that movie)? Can anyone explain this?,negative
"Luscious Candace Bergen as a prim Victorian beauty  kidnapped by Sean Connery as a devilish desert Sheikh! How can you go wrong? How? Oh  let me count the ways!!! Earthy  primitive Sean Connery  exactly the right man to tame a brittle  classy beauty like Candace  is . . . well  underwhelming in the role. That's because  instead of having dialog about the real issues (you are a woman . . . I am a man!) he has to babble nonsense about the will of Allah and the wind blows destiny across the desert sands. John Milius  a director known more for the worship of naked male bodies and brute military force than any insight (or interest) in conventional human relationships  has a maddening way of cutting away from his desert lovers every time it looks like Candace might get kissed. Instead of watching nature take its course with two fabulously attractive people in a picturesque landscape  we are treated to endless  (and I do mean ENDLESS) shots of Brian Keith flashing his walrus sized choppers and delivering gritty sermons on the joys of being Teddy Roosevelt. I have nothing against Teddy Roosevelt  but watching him test out his new rifle or make speeches about the heroic death of a big bear just doesn't excite me the way the love story between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery would have . . . if it had ever actually gotten underway! The weird thing is  Milius spends most of his time building up characters and story lines that have no resolution. Candace's two little children in the story both get more screen time than she does. There's no humor  no chemistry  no sizzle  in any of the things that happen to her in the desert. Unless you think it's funny that after weeks of galloping around on horseback her hair is still perfect.<br /><br />The only real moment in the story is when  late at night  Candace Bergen shakes her little daughter out of a sound sleep on soft cushions and says  we must escape. The little girl turns over and  without missing a beat  replies  but mother, I was sleeping! That one line sums up what's really missing from the story. No danger  suspense  or sizzle in the basic story line  of a cultivated lady in captivity. She (and her children) are both so snug and well cared for that it's hard to believe anyone is worked up about their fate.<br /><br />Mind you  if Candace herself had said the line it might have worked better. If the tension came from her enjoyment of her captivity  (or her delight at being in the arms of Sean Connery) and her guilt about all the trouble being caused by her abduction  then the story would have had some tension. But Milius makes the odd assumption that the audience is just as worked up as he is over whether Teddy Roosevelt will get the chance to prove his manhood three thousand miles away. In the end the pretty lady and her children don't seem to matter worth a damn to him . . . and since they're at the center of the story the whole thing seems rather dry and endless . . . like the burning desert sands.",negative
In 1904 Tangier  a wealthy American woman and her two children are kidnapped by Berbers  murderous desert pirates who scorn the Moroccan government and  by doing so  kidnap American pestilence  which attracts the attention of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. Fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar  somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desert-sheik films of the 1940s (with a bit of The King and I interjected  besides). Portraying the cloaked  mustachioed  bloodthirsty leader and his snippy  haughty captive  Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could be acting in two entirely different movies (neither one seems to know how far to carry the camp-elements of their characters and dialogue  and both seem singularly without proper direction). The various (and anonymous) slashings and beheadings which occur are arbitrary: we don't know any of these victims  and the big action scenes become blurry  noisy montages of sand-swept violence on horseback. The pluses: a much-lauded music score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar-nominated  but a loser to John Williams' Jaws)  fine location shooting and cinematography. *1/2 from ****,negative
Let's not fool ourselves  okay? We all know that this film was made because of the success of the Grumpy Old Men movies. Unlike those  however  this travesty has zero humor and very little heart.<br /><br />Gloria DeHaven is the sole shining light to be seen. It breaks my heart that she was finally given the chance to show off her skills to a new generation of moviegoers  only to end up in a piece of dreck such as this. There was a touching scene which featured her being stood up by someone she was falling in love with. Her fine performance was the only quality acting going on in Out To Sea. Everyone else is just going through the motions. 2/10,negative
I never heard of this film when it first came out. It must have sunk immediately. :o) I saw it on cable while sick in hospital so I hardly had enough energy to watch it  let alone turn the channel. Better choice than the Style Channel. ;0(. Filmed on location  this travelogue should have been on the Travel Channel. The plot is recycled from ship board farces of the thirties and forties. The cast seems to have been recycled from the fifties. Donald O'Connor  star of musicals and Edward Mulhare as a card shark. As to the main cast  Walter Matthau is still playing the same part as he did in Guys and Dolls or was it the one about the orphan girl? Wiseacre irresponsible gambler and rounder. But it just doesn't take with a man of his age. As to Jack Lemmon  he plays his part so straight  he can hardly dip and glide when dancing. And as mentioned  Dyan Cannon is outstandingly attractive as another swindler sailing with her mother who thinks Walter is rich  while he thinks she is rich. Elaine Stritch plays Dyan's mother  another retread from the fifties. The most fun is the running feud between Brent Spiner as the domineering and snotty cruise director who immediately spots Walter as a poor dancer  and spends his time trying to get him dismissed so he will have to pay for his free passage. In the end  though he receives his comeuppances. Meanwhile Jack mopes about  meets an attractive woman  with mutual attraction  but their affair is broken up by Walter's lies that Jack is a doctor  when he was actually a retired department store buyer. But finally  the two men take to the sea in a rubber boat to intercept her seaplane and all is well. There does not seem to be any principal player under the age of fifty.,negative
This movie cannot be serious because it has a nerdy looking kid named Curtis killing people. The other two psycho kids are kind of cute but that Curtis kid is just so ugly because he wears these huge  brown  ugly glasses. The actor probably wandered on the wrong set and he was really supposed to go to Revenge of the Nerds.<br /><br />Another thing that I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet time shooting people. I kept my finger on the fast forward button because he took too long and what was up with his voice? He sounded like he was fourteen and not ten. Another thing I hated was that he kept smiling like an idiot and there was no point to that.<br /><br />Then they put that annoying kid in the freezer and somehow he found a flashlight in there. That didn't make any sense and neither did the music. The music didn't fit any of the scenes.<br /><br />This movie is slow  boring and a waste of time. Watch a different movie on your birthday.,negative
Sadness was the emotion I felt  after the screen went dark. Puzzled  was another. Why would two seasoned screen vets like Matthau and Lemmon sign on to this putrid project? I'm under the impression they didn't read the script  before the cameras started rolling. All the cast is wasted  in this unfunny  uninteresting and unimpressive movie. Sadly enough  this was one of elegant Edward Mulhare's last projects  here as the heavy. Dyan Cannon tries  Hal Linden looks bored  Donald O'connor reciting a few lines laden with profanity. (??!!). I'm not with the Legion of Decency. My point is they were spouted purely for the strangeness of hearing him use off-color language. That is a desperate attempt to infuse humor into a picture. He actually did deliver the film's only morsel of entertainment  when he pattered about on the dancefloor  though. I save my harshest criticism for the leads. Walter Matthau should have known better. He still delivers great solo performances (IQ  Dennis The Menace  etc.). His character  although affable  is rather dull and one dimensional. Seen him once  seen him all. Jack Lemmon gives another one of his trademark  weepy  just too darn sensitive male portrayals. When he starts that mode  I vicariously want to hand him a box of tissues. OUT TO SEA is painfully unfunny  and whoever produced this mess should be made to walk the plank.,negative
hair  the movie based on the broadway hit fails to achieve any redeemable cinematic qualities. you cant really take the play and make it a movie. whether one is so tempted by the rock music to see this movie  it really detracts from the quality of a broadway show. worse than seeing sitcom reruns. musical fiasco  and cant believe others rated it so high.,negative
This film is an insult to the play upon which it is based. The character of Claude has been warped beyond recognition leaving a painful performance that does not even vaguely resemble the original plot. Shame  shame  shame. They have also cut a fair number of the original score of change the context in which the songs are sung. This warps the air of the film and causes the viewer who is aware of how this should be to wince as the writer of this screen play gives Hud a wife turns Sheila into a spoiled rich girl  characterizes Claude as a cowboy  and kills Burger by sending him to Vietnam instead. If one is not familiar with the original plot I assure you this is not a bad film for you to see  but if you ever wish to see the original or are  as I am  a die-hard fan of the classic play  you would do best to avoid the film altogether. One really must stick to one or the other.,negative
I should start off by saying I have something of a love-hate relationship with musicals. Some of them are fantastic  some are downright crap. So I expected Hair to fall into one of those categories. However  it didn't  falling instead in the middle.<br /><br />The songs aren't brilliant  though the Sodomy song did make me smile a lot  and everything is rather dated looking. But the movie didn't draw me in as others have  such as Rocky Horror. Although that's a bad example  since for years I hated Rocky Horror  then all of a sudden I got it and have loved it ever since. Maybe Hair will be the same. Although I doubt it will get as much exposure as Rocky Horror due to the language and nudity content  so I doubt I will get the chance to have it grow on me. Gettit? Hair....grow...oh suit yourself.<br /><br />Anyhow  I didn't get to see the last fifteen minutes or so due to a technical glitch  which was a shame  since I would have liked to see how it ended  especially after reading some of the reviews here.<br /><br />Not a film for the casual cinema-goer  but definitely one for musical lovers. I really hope they don't re-make it  though  since I think any such re-make would end up a shallow  pale  PC version of the original.<br /><br />Worth a look for lovers of the genre.,negative
I've liked Milos Forman's movies since I saw One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus (two big masterpieces)  but when I saw Hair  I kept wondering if this was the same Milos Forman. This movie is boring and uninteresting to say the least. OK  the music is pretty good  but on screen it only seems like a bunch of drugged people dancing around (wait a minute... that's what it really is!). In fact  the only interesting part  and the only part where Milos' talent shows up  are the last 15 minutes or so  (SPOILER!!) since when Berger takes Claude's place as a soldier set to the Vietnam war. That 15 minutes are moving and well-directed  but it's a shame that we have to endure so much awful material before that.<br /><br />Well  maybe this is one of those movies you need to be on the subject to enjoy (the subject being marijuana  acid and other drugs the film glorifies). I'm not  so...,negative
I was a hippie age 22 in 1965  have seen the play 5 times  have 2 versions of the music  and have read the script many times. Maybe taken as an separate thing  the movie is OK  but as an adoption of the play  it's terrible.<br /><br />First the good. The songs are sung well  and the production values are pretty good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys  White Boys is cute. The Claude/Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a fluid production  and constant changes in it are inherent provided the basic spirit of it is retained.<br /><br />But the basic spirit was very much distorted. It seemed like all the producer wanted was to sing certain songs  and fit the story-line to them regardless of what that did to the original intent of the play.<br /><br />Claude  Sheila  and Hud were presented as a selfish brats who could care less about anyone outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parents party (it's hard to believe that she smiled while her parents were being hurt)  and repeatedly stole cars. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and car. Then she left him in the middle of the desert where he would certainly sunburn badly  probably be busted in rank  and could likely die on that lonely Nevada road. Good fun. And Hud found it fine to break his son's heart while yelling at his ex. This is not what hippies were like  not what the play described  and is directly opposite to a love generation.<br /><br />I've never seen a hippie beg for money. The point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system  not beg from it.<br /><br />After Berger is thrown in jail for ruining Sheila's party and Claude offers to bail some out  Berger insists on being bailed instead  with no better plan for bailing the rest that hitting on Sheila's parents  and then hitting on his own mommy.<br /><br />Be In has always been a very spiritual point  but here it is wasted on silly brides floating around. Even if this is part of his trip  it ruins a beautiful song. I know they're contrasting Floating In Space with the Army. But again  it totally ruins a beautiful song.<br /><br />While Sheila and Claude are skinny dipping  Berger steals their clothes  laughing it was fun man even after he could see both were very annoyed. Then a little later  Berger does one thing that no hippie ever does. He hits Claude. Terrible.<br /><br />Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing Starshine at night in some beautiful SF spot with the stars twinkling down  maybe working into an inventive duet. Instead  the whole tribe sings it in the blazing sun speeding down the road in a convertible (stolen of course).<br /><br />I was vastly disappointed with the movie in 1979  and I like it even less now. I think it would have been possible to do a reasonably close adoption of the show  but this ain't it.,negative
When a friend once lambasted me for my first movie (a pretty bad videotaped affair)  I argued that I could grow; Orson Welles' first movie  indeed  was even worse. He challenged me that it couldn't be  so I pulled out the Criterion laserdisc of (I think) CITIZEN KANE and played HEARTS OF AGE. My friend lasted just a few minutes before conceding the point.<br /><br />There is a little humor in this short  but it's basically as pretentious as (and perhaps a collegiate answer to) BLOOD OF A POET and other avant garde films of the time. It is what it is: a succession of images with a vague theme  and unless you really enjoy any footage of Welles (in heavy makeup  to boot)  this isn't really even worth tracking down.,negative
Just watched on UbuWeb this early experimental short film directed by William Vance and Orson Welles. Yes  you read that right  Orson Welles! Years before he gained fame for radio's The War of the Worlds and his feature debut Citizen Kane  Welles was a 19-year-old just finding his muse. Besides Vance and Welles  another player here was one Virginia Nicholson  who would become Orson's first wife. She plays a woman who keeps sitting on something that rocks back and forth courtesy of an African-American servant (Paul Edgerton in blackface). During this time a man (Welles) keeps passing her by (courtesy of the scene constantly repeating). I won't reveal any more except to say how interesting the silent images were as they jump-cut constantly. That's not to say this was any good but it was fascinating to watch even with the guitar score (by Larry Morotta) added in the 2005 print I watched. Worth a look for Welles enthusiasts and anyone with a taste of the avant-garde.,negative
I was at Wrestlemania VI in Toronto as a 10 year old  and the event I saw then was pretty different from what I saw on the Wrestlemania Collection DVD I just watched. I don't understand how the wwE doesn't have the rights to some of the old music  since most of those songs were created by the WWF they shouldn't have to worry about the licensing and royalty fees that prevent shows like SNL from releasing season sets. Its pretty stupid to whine about  but for me hearing Demolition come out to their theme music at a Wrestlemania in person was a memory that I never forgot  and it didn't exist on this DVD. What is the point of them even owning the rights to this huge library of video if they have to edit it so drastically to use it?,negative
This movie  despite its list of B  C  and D list celebs  is a complete waste of 90 minutes. The plot  with its few peaks  was very predictable. It was so silly that I cannot believe that I am taking the time to even write a review of it. Flex  to his credit  has grown in his ability to act since playing Michael Jackson in a made for TV movie a few years ago. Tangi  on the other hand  has regressed  as she was more talented in her role as Felicity's flunkie some years ago. As I sat watching this train wreck of a film  with its pitiful production and horrible sound quality  other four letter words came to my mind to qualify what I thought of this film. However  in an effort to keep my writings G Rated  I'll simply say this film is another four letter word starting with an L. LAME!!!,negative
A mean spirited  repulsive horror film about 3 murderous children. Susan Strasberg is totally wasted in a 5-minute cameo  even though she receives star billing. If your a Julie Brown fan  you'll want to check it out  since she's naked in a couple of shots. All others avoid.,negative
This looks so good on paper - Matt Damon  Lawrence Fishbourne  Jean Reno  nice right? And a heist with $42 million - sounds like a kick-ass crime movie.<br /><br />Big disappointment - I reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousy.<br /><br />But more than that it the pseudo reservoir Dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong. It's very much made for TV stuff.<br /><br />All in all hugely disappointing - it score points for being what it is - but loses them massively for being  bluntly  not very interesting at all...,negative
Armored<br /><br />The best part about driving an armored vehicle is that if any bums approach you at a red light asking for money  you can shoot them in the face.<br /><br />And while the armoured guards in this thriller aren't using their protective power to purge the drifter population  they are using their position to fleece their employer.<br /><br />When newcomer Ty (Columbus Short) lands a job with an armored trunk company  he feels like he has found his lot in life. Unfortunately  however  when he discovers that his co- workers (Matt Dillon  Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne) are plotting to take the $42 M shipment for themselves  Ty must fortify himself  and the funds  inside the armored truck.<br /><br />A tedious caper with a plodding plot and phoned-in performances  Armored is an utterly forgettable film.<br /><br />Besides  if you really want to jack millions  it's a lot simpler to just disguise yourself as an ATM. (Red Light),negative
Well where do we start  there was a lot of potential for this film with such big stars playing a role. But the whole story was ruined by a horrific plot. This movie did not pan out to be what i would expect  the good guy makes it out alive  i mean co mon nobody wants the good guy to be successful. The ending was cringe worthy and very cliché no thought what so ever  YOU GOT THE PLOT ALL WRONG THE BAD GUYS ARE MEANT TO COME OUT SUCCESSFUL.<br /><br />If you want to waste 1 hour and 2 minutes of your time spend it doing something else this movie was the epitome of CRAP. I really think the actors did this movie for some quick Vegas cash no doubt about it. SAVE your money watch a better movie.,negative
What a bad movie  the premise was all there  the actors were all there. And yet a believable plot  good dialogue  characters to relate to were somewhat missing.<br /><br />Typical heist gone wrong premise set against a backdrop of everyman being shafted by the system. The lead character Tye and his little brother have been having no luck and their house is going to be repossessed  along comes godfather Matt Dillon (Who does not look much older than Tye so not exactly sure how that happened)to the rescue with a plan to steal money from an armoured van which they work on as security guards. Tye has a brief flirtation with a conscience but decides to go along with it. And thus begins a truly awful hole ridden 30 minutes of unbelievable trash. I will not list all the ways in which this movie was unrealistic but let me point out the major ones:<br /><br />Because of Tye deciding to be a good guy because a homeless guy became collateral damage  all of his close friends including his godfather die. His godfather who is supposedly family and the man who brought him into the caper at the last minute to help him out dies because of Tye. Tye in the process of thwarting his friends and godfather destroys all the money. The money came from the same bank that was repossessing his house. And yet he chose it over the supposed family of Matt Dillon.<br /><br />There are many more  needless to say that this film was tripe and I earnestly hope nobody else goes to see it.,negative
A heist film with Jean Reno  Matt Damon and Laurence Fishburne... sounds great on paper? I suspect it must have done when someone green lighted the production of this movie but the end product is terrible!<br /><br />The story is dull  the action boring  and  for a film that is only 88 minutes it seems to just drag on. I could feel my life slipping away and was sure there was something better I should have been doing... any paint to watch dry somewhere perhaps?<br /><br />Sigh. I'm a huge fan of Jean Reno  but what on earth was he thinking when he signed up to this? There are so many other great action movies around... go watch one of those and let this movie be best forgotten.,negative
The sounds in the movie were so mundane and ridiculous  seriously banging on the door hinges for about 30 minutes really crunches your teeth and makes your head hurt.<br /><br />i love bad puns more than the next guy  but come on no blood on our hands being said about a million times by Matt Dillon' character  and when Matt Dillon's character shoots the bum the lead character which i fail to remember his name because i don't really think anyone cares gets blood on his hands literally.<br /><br />the background music with the heavy metal guitar ringing an A-chord for about 5 minutes isn't my idea of music  come on i was having the worst headache by the end of this garbage.,negative
The film had it moments  but was disappointing in my eyes anyway. It was a reworking of Trespass (Walter Hill) and so The Treasure Of the Sierra Madre  with less tension  bite and human emotion. There was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth. I watched the movie for Mr Reno and Mr Fishburn  neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for. This movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made  eats up money which could be used on better movies. For an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill. Better than watching snow fall  but not for me.,negative
Dillon  Fishbourne  Reno  should have teamed up for a much smarter effort  because this one slides in the B-Category and could have been done with no-name actors and a much smaller budget  since anyway  2 armored trucks and a wasted warehouse could not have coasted too much. Since the writers did not manage to come with a smart heist plan  they targeted the dramatics of the situation  but there was not much to exploit there either. Fishbourne and Reno do not bring anything to this movie except the media interest  they're only expensive advertising. Dillon is OK  but this was a walk in the park. The choices of the main character  Ty Hackett  are quite uninspired and the final  with the reward is quite childish. Waste of time  money  actors and so on.,negative
One of those movies in which there are no big twists whatsoever and you can predict pretty much whats is going to happen. Matt dillon was awesome once again  but the rest didn't played a bigger part as they should have.<br /><br />It was exciting in the beginning but kinda slow paced and predictable in the end.Its one of those flicks in which the good guy wins no matter happens.If you have absolutely nothing to do  you can give it a try I personally found it not worth watching. The story could have been more interesting and the director could have made it less of a B-movie by engineering a happy ending.,negative
After watching this for 15 minutes I knew how it would end. Its a cliché film with a stupid setup. I'm a big fan of thief films  but this one does not deliver anything new smart or special. It's about an insider heist gone bad because hot head-bad guy shots a bum  and of course do goody-bad guy goes on a moral trip. The reason why it's stupid and not believable is. When you've already gone so far to kill a bum  why not just kill the one guy that stands between you and 43 million. They got 45 minutes to stash the money and stage a robbery nobody in there right mind would hesitate to shoot Mr do goody and in this case he is a guy they known for a few days.... All and all I was leaning to fast forwarding from the middle of it  but I duked it out and boy do I regret it,negative
Bloody Birthday is a totally rubbish slasher movie from beginning to end. <br /><br />I found the acting to be pretty good considering the genre of movie and its obvious low budget. I don't know what was going on with the cinematography but it looked ghastly. Way too over-saturated. Maybe this is a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it always looked like that  I don't know. <br /><br />There really are no redeeming qualities to speak of. There are a few deaths but not really gory. I wouldn't bother with it if I was you. The best thing about the DVD was the 15 minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg who was very amusing and honest. He didn't have anything good to say about director Ed Hunt and admits the movie was a failure  but he would like to re-make it as he believes it has a decent plot. However  he died in 2004 so I guess it will be up to someone else to take on that challenge. With the way things have been going in the last few years it wouldn't surprise me  there's at least one re-make per week at the cinema these day. It couldn't be any worse than the original I suppose but I couldn't care less whether it got re-made or not.,negative
Disappointing heist movie indeed  I was actually expecting a pretty cool cat and mouse stuff going on through out the movie and it does have few of those cat and mouse stuff going on  but it was just pretty stupid. And it basically showed all the good scenes in the trailer  as a matter of fact if you seen the trailer to this  you basically seen the whole film cause it is just that predictable. So basically the plot is about a few armored truck company workers that try to steal the 42 million dollars they are suppose to transport  until one of the members grows a conscience. I thought the movie would be better with it's cast of well known actors  but I was wrong. I mean this isn't necessarily a bad film but it just wasn't that good either or has any depth. This is most definitely a rental at best  just not really worth seeing it in theaters. heist <br /><br />4.8/10,negative
OK I for one thought the trailer was quite good so was hopeful for this film  plus with the cast line up I was sure it couldn't get less than a 6 in my books. However I got annoyed half hour into the story... just where normal films get good  this film hit rock bottom. <br /><br />SPOILER * The guy who everyone is trying to help is so caring of other people getting hurt in the middle of the hustle that he turns on his colleagues to save a tramp and then locks himself inside one of the armoured trucks. Not only that  he constantly tries to get other peoples attention by which he ends up endangering more people and long story short  the outcome is that he is responsible for not just the tramps death  but also a police officer getting shot and the kidnapping of his younger brother... oh and all 5 of his colleagues dying disgraced deaths. <br /><br />But in the end he is HAPPY because he came to his senses halfway through the endeavour  so what if all his colleagues are now dead rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire. This film tried to be so politically correct it makes me sick! Ruined a good story. Shame really.,negative
this movie is sooooo bad that it forced me to create an account with IMDb just to warn others about it.<br /><br />i have been using IMDb for a long time  and many movies have come close to making me want to register to either praise or bash them  however none have ever been that worthy. Until now! <br /><br />I am a huge Matt Dillon fan. all i could ask myself throughout this movie is how did Dillon choose this script? really. i mean there are holes in it larger than Vredefort. <br /><br />i mean it is a modern day heist movie  not one set in the seventies. For crying out loud  even a child knows that armored trucks have gps tracking and the sort. makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in Hollywood.<br /><br />i could go on for ages  but i wont. believe me when i say this. save yourself the time and give this a skip.<br /><br />Sorry Matt  I'm still a fan  but this movie sucked.,negative
A new guard in in the armored truck gig is recruited by his co-workers to steal 42 million from the truck. No bad guys  so no one will get hurt  right? Of course things go wrong and the new guard decides to have a conscience and make things right by saving the life of a dying man.<br /><br />I'll admit that I didn't really have any interest in this film  but I didn't have any interest in Fantastic Mr Fox either  and that film made my top ten of the year. Armored is even more of a disappointment then I thought it would be. As a heist film  it fails to deliver the goods  it's boring and full of plot holes and leaps in logic that one will hurt themselves thinking about it.<br /><br />Despite this the film somehow has a really great cast  but the film doesn't even use this to it's advantage. Everyone seems wasted in wooden characters that make stupid choices. Columbus Short is an uninteresting lead that is never charismatic and never makes the audience want to give a crap. Matt Dillon is the mastermind behind the heist and he plays Mr. Nice Guy at first  then when things don't go his way he quickly becomes the villain. The rest of the impressive cast include Lawrence Fisburn  Jean Reno  Skeet Ulrich  Fred Ward  Amaury Nolasco from Prison Break and Milo Ventimiglia from Heros. Non of them do much and when they actually do something  it's without much reasoning behind it.<br /><br />The film is relatively short  but even with it's running time under 90 minutes  it felt dragged out. How long can you make a movie about a guy trapped somewhere? Phonebooth did a decent job and it was even more restricted. The leaps of logic concerning the plot here are tragic. 42 million and all the security they have are check ins every hour or so? The entire plan from my understanding was to drive the trucks into an abandoned warehouse and hide the money. Pretend to get hit and burn the trucks. They would then walk away with the money. Of course something goes wrong  or there would be no movie right? Through a series of unfortunate events out so called hero has trapped himself inside the truck with an injured officer. The rest of the movie is Dillion and his crew banging on the doors to get in. How very exciting.<br /><br />The script calls for our hero to have financial problems  he might lose his house  which would in turn make him lose his brother. You see  both their parents died and it's just the two of them looking out for each other. So now he has a reason to join the heist. At first he didn't want in  but his money problems is just the right push to throw him in the thick of things. How convenient. <br /><br />Armored's whole spin on the heist genre is that it's from an armored truck  from the guys who drive it. After that basic premise  the film falls flat on it's face. I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner each time someone spoke. Speaking of the ending  it sucks. <br /><br />Skip it.,negative
How do you take a cast of experienced  well-known actors  and put together such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Armored. Six co-workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves. But  just as they get to first base with their plans  everything unravels quickly. With a plot like this  you'd think it couldn't be too bad  at least for an action movie. However  in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal  everyday kind of guys. They joke  they laugh  have a few drinks together  etc. Then  we suddenly learn they're planning to rob their own business. The hero Ty  (Columbus Short)  is sucked into the scheme because of the cold  cruel world  even though he's a decorated veteran  nice guy  and reliable employee. Oh my  oh my! Then in the last 40 minutes of the film  these former regular guys nearly all turn into money-crazed psychos  willing to butcher each other for cash. In the last scenes Mike  (Matt Dillon)  goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. The viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's utterly unbelievable and B movie is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot. I would say don't waste your time--too bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne  Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this picture.,negative
I have to admit that I am disappointed after seeing this movie. I had expected so much more from the trailers. The movie was absolutely horrible. It lacked a real story line and the acting was not exactly the best. Don't waste your time. The movie is not what the trailers lead you to think it is. I would have to say that I don't usually write anything about movies on IMDb (in fact this is my first one) but this movie was such a disappointment that I registered just to let people know not to waste their time or money. The story line is that of a heist that is to happen and it looks like it had potential to be good but the things that happen in the movie are a little far fetched to be believable. Watch another movie instead  maybe the inside man???,negative
Unbelievably disappointed. The pace was slow. The characters unbelievable and throughout the film as a whole just let me feel bored and unfulfilled. There was no real plot that could keep you revolving around the film and keep you interested. The heist itself never offered any excitement and didn't seem very well though through.<br /><br />There was not enough depth or background to any character and Laurance Fishbourne's character was one I eagerly awaited for  unfortunately Laurance has no idea how to play the thuggish brut and is much preferred as a likable character. Columbus short one of my favourite actors (in stomp the yard) let me down with his performance  his character was dark and you could hardly see what drove his reasoning.<br /><br />The only character I think offered anything to the film was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes). Though his character quite small and insignificant I think his touch added to an all around dull film.<br /><br />In Conclusion buy the DVD if you want to find a new way to waste your time.,negative
This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! The cast was fantastic  but the movie itself was horrible. It was so awful  I had to register just to say how bad it was.<br /><br />I watched this movie  and I wanted to break it every minute I watched. It could have been great. Had a great premise. If you're going to rob an armored car  and there's a homeless person which sees you  you have to do  what you have to do. For the main character to decide to get a cop killed  and kill his friends and co-workers after the homeless guy was already dead  it's just ridiculous. And yes  I'm sure there will be responses to this about how his conscious got to him  but come on.<br /><br />The main character crawled out the bottom of the armored truck  no one saw him. He blew up the stash of money and grabbed and dragged the cop right behind the other guards and no one saw him. He was able to get back in the armored car  and no one saw him... This movie had potential  but blew it.<br /><br />You couldn't pay me to watch this movie ever again! DON'T EVER watch it! Aggravating...,negative
There is not much to add to what others have already commented  the movie fails hard where it shouldn't  it has no depth in the planning of the heist and the characters are so unbelievable.<br /><br />One thing that got me thinking  was that although the rest of the gang is trying hard to remove the pins from the doors of an armored truck  because there is supposed to be no other way of opening it  the guy inside the truck  with great ease manages to remove the floor of the truck which happens to have a hole in it so he can get out  and then get back in  without being noticed by anyone  because no one else could think that he could get out from there or even better  that they could have gotten into from there.<br /><br />Promising but not quite there.,negative
I am so angry to the point i normally down make reviews with spoilers but in this case I'll make an exception.The first scenes of this movies are weak and then when they get to the meat and potatoes of the movie it sucks. This is one movie were i rooted for the bad guys because the captain-save-the-day was unbelievable and there was no connection to him or nothing to make you like him. The lead actor gave the weakest performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon couldn't even save this movie. Sometime there are eye openers or great moments in a film that may not be that great..this movie has none. If you are looking for a movie to see in the meantime while nothing peeked your interest...don't choose this one..save your money.,negative
I went to see this movie today  with hopes that it would involve an at least half-intelligent story. I was extremely disappointed  as it did not. The plot  and the decisions by the main character  were so far-fetched. I was hoping for a Dog Day Afternoon-type movie  but instead got something totally unacceptable. I actually found myself totally hoping for the hero to be knocked off  and I nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but didn't. Heist movies are notmeant to be feel-good flicks  and this one tried to be just that. Every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie  I found myself saying  no way. Without giving the whole story away  it revolved around an armored car guard who was financially down and out  and whose house was going into foreclosure. He was invited in on a heist  and accepted  only to back down once the action began. Weak.,negative
"At the heart of almost every truly great crime thriller is a carefully considered  methodically planned-out high stakes super-crime  which 9 times out of 10 is committed by a bunch of likable  grey-scale morality underdogs for who life isn't fair  for whom getting back at the man is  well  something worth cheering for. First-time screenwriter James V. Simpson's script for Armored gets this half right. He made extra-double-sure that we've got nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned  Iraq war veteran Ty Hackett (Stomp the Yard's Columbus Short)  who's about to have his house taken away by an evil bank (brother  I've been there). And he gave Ty a good family friend in Mike (Matt Dillon) who is super nice and gets him a job at the armored car company that he works at with Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and some weird French dude (Jean Reno). These guys like to have fun and play pranks  but they are also serious armored car guys too  so that means they carry guns and are tough.<br /><br />After a short while  as one theoretically watches Armored  one might start to think as I did  that maybe - just maybe - this is going to be some kind of awesome  tongue-in-cheek  cornball heist movie with some on-the-nose characterizations that move the story along its natural course  cranking up the personal stakes of all involved in hopes of unveiling a really  really clever plan with lots of potential 'holy sh*t' moments. I mean  the music alone is textbook heist-movie - gritty  edgy beats working overtime as we're treated to close-ups of characters who say things like As a matter of fact I do, and Are you crazy?? For 45 minutes or so  the movie had some serious genre-flick potential.<br /><br />Then things start to really stink. These dudes  these idiots  have no plan. There's no Ok, here's what we're gonna do... scene  no blueprints  no explosives  no black van or ski-masks (despite their 'test-run'  as can be seen in a trailer). No  these guys are going to steal $42 million dollars from their own trucks (which are only being tracked by HOURLY contact over the radio  despite being equipped with some fancy  big-deal 'GPS technology')  and they aren't even going to sit down and discuss it. Hell  Mike only tells Ty about the plan the night before  which is completely ridiculous. But of course  Ty's got his house to think about so as long as Mike promises that 'no one will get hurt ' he's on board. Guess what  though. Somebody gets hurt. Why? Because  besides driving the trucks into an abandoned factory to hide the money  they have no plan. That was it. That was how far they thought things out. So  naturally  things start to unravel. These cats deserve everything they get for being so unprepared.<br /><br />This script  frankly  feels like it's like the product of some bad improv game: Armored Car, robbed by its own guards...GO! Despite some half-decent buildup that could have maybe taken the film in a few interesting directions  the story just completely falls apart  and pretty soon  NOTHING makes sense  or is even remotely plausible.<br /><br />When filmmakers don't have a cool hook for their heist  their characters seem stupid  and bungling. And when characters are stupid  and bungling  it's hard for an audience to invest in them  and their story. And when that happens  any suspense drains out the bottom of the movie  leaving a laughable  hollow husk.<br /><br />Skip it. 3/10",negative
"When you make a film with a killer-kids premise  there are two effective ways to approach it; you can either make it as realistic as possible  creating believable characters and situations  or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughs (something which the makers of Silent Night, Deadly Night did  for example  on an equally controversial subject: a killer Santa). The people who made Bloody Birthday  however  do neither of those things; they simply rely on the shock value of the image of a kid with a gun (or a knife  or a noose  or an arrow) in his/her hand. The result is both offensive and stupid. The whole film looks like a bad idea that was rushed through production (and then kept from release for several years). It's redeemed a tiny bit by good performances from the kids  but it's VERY sloppily made. (*1/2)",negative
I had been amazed by director Antal's Kontroll back in 2003. His first American project  Vacancy  was less impressive but a decent start. Armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable  the film never rises above the level of a B movie. <br /><br />It's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver. Antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick. Then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn't really deliver in that department either. <br /><br />What you are left with is one implausible situation after another  a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money. If you look past the sharp cinematography  cast and the tight music score  you're left with what could have been a below average direct-to-video featuring Van Damme or Seagal. <br /><br />This was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time.,negative
After reading Fool For Love in a Drama class of mine  I was looking forward to seeing how Sam Shepard's wonderful play would be translated to the screen. Much to my dismay  it was nowhere near as entertaining as the play. The film seemed to drag  the music was inappropriate for the tone of the movie  and all the raw energy of the play seemed to have been sucked out of this film version. It's a shame to see this come out this way even with Shepard's involvement  playing the role of Eddie. Do yourselves a favor...see the play next time it's being performed in your area or simply read the book instead.,negative
Fool for Love is one of the several now forgotten films Robert Altman directed throughout the 1980s. This one  a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard play that features Shepard in the lead role  just simply isn't very good. Altman made many not-very-good films over the course of his fascinating career  and many times the fault was his. But here I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a flimsy play. Altman's direction is assured  the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work with  but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere  and takes its time getting there.<br /><br />Shepard is Eddie  a stuntman who has a love/hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere  while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who may be either a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May quietly observes. Randy Quaid rounds out the four-person cast as a gentleman caller.<br /><br />The only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that Eddie's and May's relationship is incestuous. However  this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. The screenplay doesn't explore their relationship in any detail  and it doesn't use their relationship to explore any more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric  mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots. <br /><br />The last half hour or so of the film is especially bad  when Eddie's and May's back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone  somnolent voice over.<br /><br />Chalk this up to another of Altman's experiments gone awry.<br /><br />Grade: C-,negative
I saw this only because my 10-yr-old was bored. He and his friend hated it but of course liked being at the movies. This is the first time I've strongly disagreed with Ebert in many years. There is not a single thing to recommend this film. Willis is good  as always. But the story stinks  is unbelievable  there is no real story  no action  no interesting cinematic sequences  no surprises  and worst of all  the child star is A thoroughly repulsive slug guaranteed to turn off any parent who does not have a dweeby fat slob for a kid. By all means stay away and spare your child - unless you want to punish him or her. There is no excuse for such lousy directing or writing and one hopes these filmmakers will suffer accordingly.,negative
The first few minutes showing the cold and crusty the Willis character were pretty enjoyable  especially with Jean Smart  but it really tanked after that. This is just hackneyed big man and little irritating kid stuff from way back with no innovation at all. I know that the casting probably picked this kid to show that Willis was just as irritating in his younger self  but I found this kid ESPECIALLY irritating and whinney.,negative
There are a few scripts like this one floating around Hollywood; this one is not even close to the best--just the first. This is all production value  no substance  but the Disney name probably will help it. A good idea  a wasted opportunity.,negative
Bruce Willis  as usual  does an excellent job.<br /><br />[warning: may be considered a spoiler]<br /><br />While my friend thought it was good  I kept glancing at my watch during the entire movie wondering when it would end. After seeing such great flicks as The Patriot and Chicken Run I was really disappointed in Disney's The Kid.<br /><br />Willis plays a middle-aged man with a harsh and realistic attitude on putting a positive spin on people's images (he's an Image Consultant). An unknown kid shows up. Yes  it's him but younger  and even Lily Tomlin can see him. At this point I'm reminded of a cross between a poor Quantum Leap episode and a bad time traveling flick.<br /><br />Kid and Willis go through trying to figure out why he's in that time period. They figure it out. They meet Willis when he's older. Nevermind that it never goes into detail how old Willis teleports them between time periods and gets them together to begin with  how he got that knowledge to begin with  how he came to the realization that he needed to do this  and so on.<br /><br />Basically  it's a very tired  unoriginal  uninspiring plot that has some great actors in it. The good news is that the Kid actor is nowhere near as annoying as he's presented in the trailers on television.,negative
After 15 minutes watching the movie I was asking myself what to do: leave the theater  sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth. I finally watched the movie: what a waste of time. Maybe I am not a 5 years old kid anymore!,negative
I can't emphasize it enough  do *NOT* get this movie for the kids.<br /><br />For that matter  you'd best spare the adults from it as well.<br /><br />All right  perhaps I'm overexaggerating a little. This isn't the worst kids' movie... no  let me rephrase that. This isn't the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults FOR dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids (that would be Jack  which I've been meaning to review / gut like a fish).<br /><br />Adults won't learn anything surprising (well  if you must  fast-forward to just before the end credits for a Educational Bit about an Interesting Cosmic Phenominon). We don't usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way. Well  duh  I could have told you that (so can four years of college at an art school  but I degress).<br /><br />I have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie. Most likely it will only upset them (we get to watch the moment when Russ was traumatized at eight years old). There's a better movie  Kiki's Delivery Service  that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head. And the adults will like it too!<br /><br />By the way  there is a moment in the movie made with amature MST3K-ers in mind  if they think of that OTHER Bruce Willis movie with a sad little kid in it.,negative
what was Bruce Willis thinking when he signed on for this one?? this one made no sense to me.. i was so confused by it  it wasnt funny at all.. I dont even know why Disney made this one.. Bruce is a Great actor whom ive liked for a Long time .. and this disappointed me a lot.. Pass this one by on the video shelf....,negative
The Kid was born retarded. It pulls in a half-dozen directions  features dialog and action lifted from much older and better-known flops  and might be funny -- if only the writers knew what funny is.<br /><br />Disney stuff has gotten a lot better in the last couple of decades  but don't let that fool you. They should have given The Kid a wide berth  sang it a lullaby  then ran the train into a ravine. Mercy killing.,negative
When people say children are annoying u think ya my little cousins can be annoying and i said LITTLE. These children are turning 10 and they are without a doubt the most annoying bratty children you will ever encounter (in a film). Lets start with the blonde - Debbie - She's a slut of a girl  i mean come on she wears mini skirts  she has stupid frizzy blonde hair and a freckley red bunny like face. She acts so innocent. Next we have the second child - the Geek - who thinks he's so cool  with his long range shooting and his use of a silencer (a coat over the gun) and most of all his evil bratty smile. The next kid is the quiet one you don't care about so thats all on him. This film angered me at the children's intelligence and the only enjoyment i got was from my cousin who kept bitching about them.,negative
First of all  I wasn't sure who this film was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn't understand and find boring. There wasn't really much to it  Bruce Willis wasn't stretched as an actor at all. He did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his - unless you are a big fan of his I wouldn't bother. And if it's the story you're interested in (guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child)  I would go to see About A Boy. It has everything this film lacked  humor  sadness and reality.,negative
Like a lot of movies involving little kids  this starts off real cute and likable...and then  after about a half hour or so  becomes the reverse.<br /><br />That's certainly the case here in this time-travel story (which I usually love) where an adult meets a kid who his really him at the age of eight! Great premise and a great lead actor in Bruce Willis  but.....<br /><br />The kid Rusty is a smart-aleck and whiny brat and Willis Rusty grown up now as Russell gets abrasive with his constant yelling. That is entertainment? No  thanks.<br /><br />Young Breslin has gone on to become a very good child actor  being involved in a number of films including The Cat In The Hat opposite a more famous child actor: Dakota Fanning. <br /><br />Overall  a disappointing film  especially with all the good press this movie got when it was released.,negative
The Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy was one of the silliest and least believable films I've ever seen. O.K  I can buy that the woman in the film is a reincarnation of a virgin that was sacrificed to an Aztec God. What I can't buy is that the incredibly phony looking mummy and the even worse looking robot. When you want to watch a film like this  you want to see lots of fighting action. But the robot and the mummy fight for about a minute total! Probably worst of all was the dia de los muertos art they had in the credits. It's the worst I've ever seen. Avoid this one if possible.,negative
Awful  confusing bit of crap from South of the Border. I've now watched it twice and I STILL don't really know what was going on. It had something to do with a stupid looking Aztec mummy  a 'human robot' that's the dumbest looking robot I've ever seen bar none  and a woman who is the reincarnation of some ancient Aztec chick. Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and droning manner by an incredibly dull scientist. This guy is a marvelous sleep aid. His nemesis is a fat slob called The Bat  which is a pretty unimaginative name for an evil scientist.<br /><br />I guess the boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug up the mummy  and what a shocker  the scientist's wife just HAPPENS to be the reincarnation of the mummy's girlfriend. They keep the mummy perpetually in a mausoleum for some reason  I guess so that the overacting bad guy can steal it. It takes him five years to do this  because he's inventing a 'human robot' to steal the mummy  or attack it  or whatever. He's after some treasure that the mummy has  so that he can be rich. But excuse me  if the guy had this huge an intellect and a strong drive to succeed  why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich that way? <br /><br />Oh  well  I suppose that would make too much sense. Instead  there is ridiculous fight between the mummy and the robot  and it's really hard to tell which one is faker looking or more cheesy. To tell you the truth  I watched this because I thought a film with a name like The Robot Vs. the Aztec Mummy just HAD to be fabulously cheesy. Instead it was just dully awful and mind blowingly confusing.,negative
Oh  man  they sure knew how to make them back then. Hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making: cardboard steel and the god fearing scientist action hero! <br /><br />This film was so close to a masterpiece  alas it was not to be  as it failed to feature ray guns and invaders from the Moon. The MST3K version tried to fix this by adding a pilot of a show called Captain Cody  where a guy with a rocket propelled jacket fights bad make-up people from the Moon  but it didn't quite add up.<br /><br />Also  the comments of the guys in the theater were not nearly as funny as I expected them to be. All in all  a great disappointment.,negative
There must be an error. This movie belongs with Plan 9  and a lot others as a quite entertaining  silly diversion. You'll never accept you like it  yet you will watch it whenever it comes out on TV. It's as simple as that.,negative
Mexican 'classic' was the third entry in the Aztec Mummy series. As you will soon find out  this movie is anything but a classic  instead  it's more like a movie that deliberately tries to bore you.<br /><br />Some scientist wants to steal Aztec treasure from a tomb  but guarding that tomb is that walking toilet paper commercial: The Aztec Mummy. Knowing he can't beat the Mummy  he then builds a robot  and a very bad one at that. We only get to see Mr.Robot in the last reel  as he clunks around  and does battle with the Aztec Mummy.<br /><br />I have seen a lot of lousy Sci-Fi films  hell most Sci-Fi films I see are lousy  but this one  for it's entire duration of 64 Minuites  is the worst movie I've seen  with Fubar coming in a close second....<br /><br />In conclusion: Don't waste your time.,negative
With the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film  I don't think that Shakespeare is in any great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy who has been disenfranchised. His stuff has been taken and this really ticks him off. He seems to know who's doing this even though he's a gyrating  raving entity. I loved the two dull men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. There are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard  full of cheap crosses and other junk. There's a mausoleum where the mummy is kept. I can't begin to reproduce the idiocy of this  including a snake pit where the good doctor is thrown (there is a door next to it so he can crawl out) to the robot  a mass of metal cans with a guy inside. The dialogue is awful. There are long pauses between speeches as if someone offstage is feeding them their lines. I love the scene where the two little kids accuse their mother of going out at night (she goes into this zombie state or something). Nonetheless  if your looking for a film that you can laugh at and never takes itself seriously  watch this. Have a couple beers first. Like a direct line from the mummy's tomb  Watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink. What more can I say?,negative
**SPOILERS** The third and mercifully last of the Aztec Mummy trilogy in the fact that the series major star-besides the Mummy- actor Ramon Gay  as Dr. Eduardo Almada  was gunned down by the outraged husband of a woman he was having an affair with on May 28  1960! Still that didn't stop Gay  in him being edited into them from his previous films  from being in a number of future Mexican horror movies made over the next four years after his death.<br /><br />In Robot vs the Aztec Mummy we have the once again mad scientist Dr. Krupp trying to get his hands on the Mummy's golden breastplate and bracelet in order  by having them deciphered  to find the Aztez treasure that's been secretly buried somewhere in modern Mexico City over 500 years ago. Robot vs the Aztec Mummy is not much as a movie in itself in that its made up of stock footage of the previous Aztec Mummy films that take up over half of the films running time.<br /><br />After getting introduced to the movie's cast members  some who have been killed in the previous Aztec Mummy films  we get down to the real nitty gritty in it involving the evil as well as criminally insane Dr. Krupp also know as The Bat. Dr. Krupp-who looks like a wild eyed and crazed Orson Wells-is a man with boundless visions of grandeur in him not only uncovering the long lost Aztec treasure but now  unlike in the two previous movies he was in  creating life and using it in making an army of human robots to take over the world. An idea he must have gotten from watching Ed Wood's 1955 Atomic Superman classic Bride of the Monster.<br /><br />Unable to handle the Mummy in his two other encounters with it  where he ended up getting thrown by it into a snake pit filled with deadly rattlers  Dr. Krupp had created a robot  with a human cadaver stuffed in it  to the job  of doing in the Mummy  for him. With he Mummy sleeping in its tomb at a local Mexico City cemetery Dr. Krupp has his Robot-Man brake into the Mummy's crypt to do battle with it and destroy it with its bolts of deadly radiation. <br /><br />***SPOILERS*** The big built-up to the Aztec Mummy Robot-Man confrontation turns to be a big let-down with the Mummy having no trouble at all dispatching the Tin-Man in less then 30 seconds together with its creator Dr. Krupp. All this while both Dr. Almada and his friend and assistant Pinacate  who came to the Mummy's aid  have nothing at all to do but sit back and watch the action. Now without the mad and off-the-wall Dr. Krupp annoying it the Mummy can go back to its eternal resting place without ever worrying about the problems of the modern world at large  like Dr. Krupp  that it has really no interest in.,negative
Following the pleasingly atmospheric original and the amusingly silly second one  this incredibly dull  slow  and uneventful sequel comes across as a major letdown. Once again the nefarious criminal mastermind the Bat (hammy Luis Aceves Castaneda) is trying to steal valuable jewelry from the Aztec mummy Popoca. The Bat builds a hilariously clunky lumbering robot with a human brain in order to achieve this heinous goal. Flatly directed by Rafael Portillo  with a talky and tedious script by Alfredo Salazar and Guillermo Calderon  cruddy continuity (for example  the Bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous film  but is miraculously alive and well here!)  an excruciatingly sluggish script  an excessive amount of stock footage from the first two flicks  a meandering narrative  a crippling lack of action and momentum  largely dreary going through the motions (non)acting from an understandably disinterested cast  and a poorly staged climactic battle between the mummy and the robot (the movie finally bursts to sidesplitting stupid life with said big bash  but alas it barely even lasts two lousy minutes and thus proves to be much too little far too late to alleviate the severity of the general overwhelming boredom)  this numbingly dry  drippy  and draggy snorefest rates as a complete washout.,negative
'Bloody Birthday' is an odd and  at times  humorous low-budget horror flick along the lines of 'Mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'The Good Son'.<br /><br />Set in a small Californian town  three babies are born at the height of an eclipse  where planetary alignment means they are somehow born without emotions. Ten years later  our three little psychopaths take themselves on a killing spree  doing away with parents  siblings  teachers and anyone else who irritates them. Only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them. There is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go!<br /><br />For a slasher film  it's very tame in terms of violence and gore  which I suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to. Instead  it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten-year-olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns  knives and crossbows. The main reason why it doesn't descend into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they slyly play the little innocents in front of undiscerning adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth.<br /><br />'Bloody Birthday' is rather mediocre as a horror flick  with few scares and little blood  but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers  it is a bit unique in that way. One to watch if there's nothing else on.,negative
The first 2/3 of this film wasn't that dissimilar to the American mummy films of the 30s and 40s. Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to defy the law and were doomed to die. One became an Aztec mummy whose job it was to guard the sacred treasure and his lady love. And the lady was reincarnated in the present day and the mummy was naturally attracted to her. So far  it's all the typical mummy film...though it's quite a bit slower and duller than the American versions. Oh  and of course the Aztec mummy looked really  really crappy.<br /><br />However  into this standard but boring film there is a super-villain. Why? I dunno--it sure didn't make any sense to have one. It seems this villain wants the treasure and he manages to hypnotize the lady and have her show them where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need the treasure? Well  to buy the equipment needed to make an army of atomic robots  dummy! But first he has to construct a single mummy to defeat the mummy  as the mummy has so far been unstoppable.<br /><br />You've got to see these human-robots as they look like the enormous clunky robots from Flash Gordon and other serials BUT they have a rubber head of a supposed dead guy inside! They really look hilariously funny and seeing the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot is worth sitting through the rest of the dull movie. Both battle in super-slow-motion like they are bathed in taffy... and it's done in such an artless and silly fashion that it is bound to elicit chuckles--certainly not thrills.<br /><br />Overall  the film is dreadfully dull and a muddled mess--especially at the end. However  for bad movie fans  it's a must-see--it's bad but unintentionally funny and great to watch and laugh at with friends.,negative
2/3 of this movie is recycled footage of the previous movies  a fact that's sadly obvious even to someone like myself who hasn't seen the original movies. And somehow it feels like a rip-off even though I haven't seen the stuff before. It's like that episode of every TV show where the characters sit around a photo album or something and you just see recycled footage of other episodes. I've seen some producers do extended montages of recycled footage  but never anything beyond 5 minutes or so. This movie is mostly stuff that had already been seen by audiences  so you could mount a case that it's one of the biggest rip-offs ever foisted on the motion picture public.<br /><br />I got to see it in the theater  in a 16mm print  which is good enough I suppose considering how rare this kind of material must be on film these days. I give the movie some credit for semi-convincing Gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor  but that's about it. The Aztec mummy monster looks good  even has some mobility in his face which is better than most movie monsters of the period. But the robot is pitiful  although it's interesting that they made the human face totally visible. It's a robot human or something of the sort as they somewhat explain in the movie. I think that's considered an android. So technically in hard sci-fi terms this movie should be called Android vs. the Aztec Mummy  but I doubt anyone was too worried about technicalities here anymore than they were worried about quality. In fact the movie is so sloppily put together that it makes television look good. Even the dubbing from Mexican into English is lazy and weak -- for example at one point the hero says I might as well begin at the beginning.... what the heck kind of translation is that? Couldn't they at least have him say start at the beginning so that it doesn't sound repetitive? A high school newspaper editor could have fixed the screenplay of this movie. It's the epitome of utilitarian film-making  just absolutely nothing is in this movie that doesn't need to be there for the basic commercial purpose of the film. They put no more effort into making it than they had to  and considering the extensive recycled footage I would doubt that they actually spent more than a week making this movie.<br /><br />I will now cease posting about it on the principle that I don't want to expend more energy in the process of commenting than the creators of the movie actually expended while making it.,negative
Ah  such an original title for a very shoddy film. The dubbing is hilarious since the voices and mouths never seem to match. As a result  I had no idea what was going on as I watched this mess unfold. There are flashbacks within the flashbacks and no real time takes place until towards the very end. The Aztec ceremony had me laughing. I rewinded it twice and got the best ab workout ever. The singing Aztec lady is comic naturale and the dancing and costumes are a hoot. Some guy gets a face full of acid  there's a lot of fighting  you have no idea who any character is (not that I really cared)  and it's a whole noir mess. Oh  and the actual fight doesn't happen for awhile  so during the movie feel free to get up  take a nap  take a trip. You won't miss anything exciting.,negative
I saw this on Mystery Science Theater 3000  and even that show couldn't really make this movie bearable. I could make a better movie with a broken camcorder and action figures. Of course  you expect terrible special effects with a movie this old  but I've seen silents that were better. The storyline has enormous gaps that leave you trying to figure out why they are even at certain scenes. The cameraman apparently doesn't know what a tripod is  and had too much coffee  or something harder maybe  because the camera is ALWAYS shaking around. I couldn't even follow the plot  but suffice it to say  this is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />UPDATE: I saw Epic Movie a while back and have decided to give this movie a 2. It's NOT the worst movie I've ever seen anymore!,negative
I am a big fan of bad horrors  cheap horrors  b movies  and all that bottom 100 movies  and I do not deny those are the worst stuff ever to enter the big screen  or even your home video for that matter. Some of them  e.g. the infamous Manos The Hands of Fate  are truly bad  and watching them  especially on your own without any friends and beer around  is a torture for a good cinema taste. <br /><br />La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano  however  was not that bad. Well  of course it's BAD - it's silly  dated  corny  cheap  etc.  there's an Aztec mummy  a tin robot  a fat masked villain  a mad scientist  Mexican mobsters  etc. the montage is poor  the lines  well  let's say the lines are not theatrical  the FX and SFX are the best what the Mexican low budget production could've offered  etc. etc. Still  the movie is FUN. it's so bad it makes you laugh cheerfully for an hour time. Sure it depends on one's sense of humor  however I'm pretty sure La Momia should teach any newcomers to this kind of cinema how to enjoy it. Please note: the movie lasts for about an hour  and I think it's just enough time of silliness one is able to easily digest. <br /><br />There's also another thing - watching La Momia can give you a clue what was the whole SF/Horror genre concept back in the fifties  when you compare it to the present day Matrix era of cinema entertainment. I think it also shows how both the industry and the audience evolved  due to the fact the watches like La Momia still attract full house in the theaters for some special shows (movies like this are special alright)  and very often receive a standing ovation.,negative
Despite having a very pretty leading lady (Rosita Arenas  one of my boy-crushes)  the acting and the direction are examples of what NOT to do while making a movie.<br /><br />Placed in southern Mexico  Popoca  the Aztec Mummy (real Aztecs  by the way  DID not made mummies) has been waken up by the lead characters and starts making trouble in Mexico City suburbia  during the first movie (The Aztec Mummy). In this second part  the leading man and woman want to find th mummy and put it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice...)<br /><br />Into this appears The Bat  a criminal master-mindless stereotype of a criminal genius who creates a human robot (some idiot inside a robot SUIT) to control Popoca and (get this) take over the world. The final match between the robot and the mummy is hilarious  some of the worst choreography ever witnessed. The funniest part is that this movie was made and released by a serious Mexican movie studio!<br /><br />The acting is just as awful hearing the movie in Spanish as it is in English (they dubbed the over-acting!). You should watch this movie through MST:3000. The comments are even funnier.,negative
This movie should have been billed as three movie-summaries linked together to form a full-length feature film (including lots of shots of people slowly walking down dark corridors and streets). BE WARNED! The first hour of this movie is simply a re-hash of the first two Aztec movies as told by the main character. The actual movie doesn't start until the thing is almost over. I must say  the overacting on the part of the Bat is quite hilarious.<br /><br />As for the robot  I thought a robot was a mechanical device that may or may not resemble a human. The Bat's robot consists of a radioactive reanimated corpse encased in a lead robot-body. As Tom Servo put it  He's not that impressive; he doesn't even have knees! That  and it takes the robot about an hour just to lumber across the room. But once he catches you  WATCH OUT! He'll disintegrate you with a touch (powered by radium? Pluh-ease!).<br /><br />This is a great movie when accompanied by Joel and the Bots. Otherwise  you're just a glutton for abuse.,negative
RVAM's reputation preceded it. I first heard of it in one of those Medved style movie books  The 50 Worst Movies Ever or The Golden Turkey Awards  or something like that. Every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it. So when the Exposed Film Society finally got around to showing it  I was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide. <br /><br />However  Robot wasn't really all that bad. <br /><br />Oh  this is definitely a Z film through and through. Some of the voice dubbing (as is usually the case for K. Gordon Murray imports) is awfully cheesy  and the movie itself seems to be structurally something of a Frankenstein  since a huge chunk of it seems to be footage from a previous Aztec Mummy movie  narrated with a voice-over by the leading man. A dead giveaway: anytime the question Then what happened? is asked more than twice in the dialog  you are looking at reassembled footage put together with little regard for plot coherence or momentum. In RVAM  Then what happened? or What happened then? is uttered at least four times in the 1st hour. <br /><br />Even without the structural problems  the plot and dialog don't translate well to an older American audience. For instance  as the hero explains (and explains and explains) the back-story. he includes a remark about Doctor Krupp  a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal and began his quest for the treasure that the Aztec mummy guards. No background  no explanation  he just suddenly turned evil. Obviously  this was aimed at a pretty undiscriminating audience. <br /><br />The clincher  though  is the Robot  the supposed showcase of this movie. This Robot is the worst robot special effect since Undersea Kingdom or even Santa Claus Vs. The Martians. Compared to this hunk of junk  the Tin Man from the Wizard Of Oz looked like the Terminator chassis that chased Linda Connor through the foundry in T2. The Aztec Mummy himself is well designed and executed; he's recognizably undead  familiar enough to look like a mummy  and yet distinct from the Boris Karloff bandage collection familiar to most American audiences. But whoever designed the Robot in this followup had no feel for the concept...or no budget. They could at least have given him some knees  for heaven's sake. <br /><br />In addition  the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I've seen shoving matches on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing.) Then the movie basically just stops. That seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itself.<br /><br />In spite of all these problems  the movie isn't horrible or incompetent the way a Coleman Francis film or a Larry Buchanan film was. Compared to Monster A-Go-Go or Attack of The Eye Creatures  RVTAM is like a Coppola film. It's just kind of dull and boring and silly. The actors are competent (in a mannered B movie way) and reasonably photogenic; Dr. Krupp  in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he leers and plots and capers about in his cape and Phantom Of the Opera suit. I often found myself rooting for him  in spite of his being the villain. <br /><br />Anyway  I've seen much  much worse. File this with Samson Vs The Vampire Women  under interesting Mexican juvenile oddities.,negative
I have watched this movie twice in the past six months (what I go through so you don't have to).The first viewing left me half crazed and babbling.The second viewing at 5am on a rainy morn was a little better.I only screamed in agony once.<br /><br /> Seems Pocona (The Aztec Mummy)had the hots for a certain Aztec Princess who wassupposed to keep her maiden.Obviously they gave each other the business and were put to death for it.(Now that is severe!).But before they are the film tries to put us to death with a screeching Aztec ceremony.The singing will make your ears bleed.<br /><br /> Anyhow there is the usual reincarnation nonsense. Not to mention a treasure map on a breastplate & bracelet guarded by that swathed slob Pocona.By this time Pocona looks like he's been on a 2000 year bender and is after the defilers of his tomb.His groans & moans sounds like he has a bad case of Montezuma's revenge(or he read the script for this movie).That will make your breath stink.<br /><br /> An evil Dr Von Krupp appears wanting the Aztec treasure(possibly to finance acting lessons & screenwriting classes for cast & crew).He is called The Bat because in The Curse Of The Aztec Mummy he wore a bat like cape  hat and something like a ski mask over his face.Guess it's better than the Laughing Fat Man.<br /><br /> The Bat in typical mad scientist fashion wants to rule the world. He stresses this by rolling his eyes laughing maniacally and chewing the scenery.He has cobbled together an invincible robot.Looks like the 'bot was made from a garbage can  a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 Buick.This will make your eyes bleed.A company even takes credit for making this tin can!<br /><br /> Well the mighty showdown between Pocona and the Robot takes place in the Mummy's new crypt having been made homeless earlier.<br /><br /> About half of this movie is culled from La Aztec Momianever released in the US in its original form but in a chopped atrocity from Jerry Warren(see my review on Attack Of The Mayan Mummy) and Curse Of The Aztec Mummy.The robot is frankly stupid as are most of the characters.If that and the plot doesn't make you howl with laughter nothing will.<br /><br /> My first impression was so bad it would have gotten a one. But after seeing Mayan Mummy(which is a movie deserving of being burned) and watching Robot again  it garners a 3.You have to watch this with no expectations at all. Then it can be naively pleasant.,negative
Is it a poorly acted  cliche-ridden pile of trash? Of course. Anyone who doesn't realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesn't have any right judging movies in the first place. Thus  I will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10:<br /><br />Violence and gore: 4 -- For this genre  there are very few deaths  and the gore is almost non-existent. Anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things  which raises the bar a little.<br /><br />Suspense: 1 -- Okay  I feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kids.<br /><br />Nudity/sex: 7 -- Lots of boobage from three different women  one of whom is the MTV vj Julie Brown. There are two sex scenes  but little is shown in them.<br /><br />Unintentional humor -- 4 -- There are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary  but all in all  it's just bad  not funny bad.<br /><br />Overall -- 4 -- It's not unwatchable. There are a few fun moments  and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie. However  only watch this movie if you're a big fan of the 80's slasher flicks. This definitely falls on the lower end of the scale  but it's not all the way at the bottom. The real downside is the disappointing ending. It almost ruined the movie for me.,negative
the usual disclaimer - I do not give 1 star ratings to movies which are harmless  bad  low budget and silly  although they may deserve it. These films are often funny  and get rated 2-4 based sheerly on entertainment value - not as a representation of their exemplary film artistry. This film fits this model perfectly. It is a Mexican monster movie  riddled with voice-over narrative and extremely weak not-so-special effects. The makeup is not that bad  and the acting is sometimes quite entertaining  but this film is almost as silly as Aliens vs Predator and the script isn't half as slick (Aliens vs Predator might get a 1 from me  but I want to see it again before I commit).<br /><br />The plot is ridiculous  but deliciously convoluted. If you've read this far  you must really want to know... A group of remarkably unscientific scientists comprise the main characters. Most of them are heroes - sort of - but one is (of course) mad  and quite perverse. This mad scientist invents a laughable nuclear powered robot (who looks a bit like the tin man from Wizard of Oz  but has a human face inexplicably located inside its head). An Aztec mummy  discovered by the same 'scientist' whose wife just so happens to have been an Aztec princess in a past life (don't ask)  is pitted against the robot for the big climax the fight scene alone is enough to put the most stoic movie watcher on the floor in belly laughs.<br /><br />For what its worth  given the budget and the utter silliness of the script  this is a very entertaining low budget goof ball monster movie. If you're into that sort of thing  go for it.,negative
I`m in two minds about FOLLOWING   the film debut of Christopher Nolan . Part of me admires it for costing 6 000 dollars to make but part of me hates it for being too art house . In many ways it reminds me of the cult movie PI   a film I disliked   and I can`t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . Wouldn`t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? <br /><br />Oh well I guess FOLLOWING gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6 000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it   but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn`t made by the director of MEMENTO ?,negative
On Humphrey Bogart's first trip to Hollywood  he got his first leading man role in this B picture Love Affair. The first thing you ought to realize is that this film has absolutely nothing to do with the classic Love Affair later in the decade with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne or the two remakes that followed. It's not half as good any of those films.<br /><br />In fact Bogey is second billed to Dorothy Mackaill as a spoiled heiress who finds out she's been living her extravagant lifestyle courtesy of her late father's best friend and financial adviser Hale Hamilton. It comes as quite a shock to Mackaill. She considers a show business career as a way for an income.<br /><br />Bogart is a test pilot who is also an aeronautical engineer and he's designing an ultimate airplane motor and is looking for investors. Mackaill is willing to do it  besides she likes what she sees in Bogey.<br /><br />Considering the cynical roles that Bogart later made a specialty  it's a bit disconcerting to see him as this highly moral and self righteous character in Love Affair. The part doesn't wear well on him.<br /><br />Love Affair is your average B program second feature  nothing terribly special about it.,negative
In 1932  Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown--an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films. And  because he was an unknown  the movie they gave him was clearly a B-movie--a quick film with relatively low expectations. After seeing it  I could see why it would still take Bogart many more years AND another film studio before he became a household name. While the film isn't terrible  it certainly isn't good--making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today.<br /><br />Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company. However  when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way  his dreams all seem to go on hold. As one of the characters in the film said  the combination of the two is like oil and water--they just don't mix.<br /><br />While Bogart is throwing away his promising career  his sister is going full speed on the Road to Skankville--having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash! Bogey has no idea his sister ISN'T the actress she claims to be and doesn't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is....Bogart's SISTER!!! All this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable. However  what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time! By now  the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey's sister (whew!) but because she's now poor and no good for Bogart  she's about to fly away and kill herself. Bogey finds out  chases the plane on foot  jumps on the plane as it's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her!!! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous  I found myself laughing out loud. Up until then  I might have scored it a 4 or 5--this sunk the movie to a 3 (how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me).<br /><br />The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film. On top of that  it's all wrong for Bogart  as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s. Manly and solid better suits the man--one of America's great actors but clearly out of his element here.<br /><br />By the way  those who love Pre-Code films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one. Practically everyone in the film believes in and practices pre-marital sex and Bogey curses in the film--things you never would have seen after the toughened and more moralistic Production Code was adopted in 1934.,negative
This is so embarrassing. It's a REMAKE of The Wedding Singer  which happens to be my favorite movie which gives me another reason to disapprove of this film. It has the same plot  same jokes  same characters. Jeez  people need to be more original.,negative
Where should I begin with this movie. All I know is that it is a mess. Be the script  story  or the actors. First of all  this movie is very disappointing from Salman Khan who gave us a fun Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge and Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega before this. Second Rani is getting really annoying  appearing in every stupid movie since Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (glad Saathiya stopped this nonsense). The story is stolen from The Wedding Singer  but ruins the funny movie. The dialogues are lacking. I may have laughed here and there  but entertained? NO!!! Salman Khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies  but here he is insane. His character is poorly written. One minute he is poor and next minute you wonder how is he poor. Rani Mukherjee looks like a plain jain and wasn't putting any effort. She luckily redeemed her career with Saathiya because her career was going haywire around this time. Pooja Batra put a little charm here with her looks but it is still not enough. Jackie Shroff is wasted. Kashmira Shah's beauty and acting has ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script. Raveena Tandon looks beautiful  but puts little performance. Mohnish Behl gets the award for Worst (Supporting) Actor (they need Razzie's because there have been terrible movies in India). He says stupid dialogues  dances terribly  looks weird  and is not in his regular form. Just to tell you  there is more to the cast who are also terrible. If it weren't for Raveena's awesome beauty in Aa Meri Life Bana De  I wouldn't give the movie a point. Otherwise the dancing by Salman was terrible. Pooja Batra was dancing like a wind in Savariya  otherwise I wish the costumes were given a make-over and the rest of the cast (and their monkey dancing) had been blown away from the wind. The good song of the album was O Priya O Priya which doesn't have a good enough picturization. Same goes for the half way decent title song. Otherwise this movie (and the rest of the songs) are a no-no for everyone.,negative
K Murli Mohan Rao made the much better BANDHAN in 1998 This film is an awful remake of THE WEDDING SINGER<br /><br />Basically in short  the film consists of: Salman Khan who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenes<br /><br />Jackie Shroff- wasted  bored and tired  his role is so stupid He is shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer?<br /><br />Inder Kumar- confusing characterization again<br /><br />Rani Mukherjee- boring  overweight and does nothing special Pooja Bhatra- tall  fair and actress worthy but lacks talent<br /><br />Kashmira Shah- says a dial as if a poetry<br /><br />Mohinish Behl- poor fellow the 2 kids were awful too<br /><br />The story is the same and has awful comic scenes  a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track of Shakti Kapoor<br /><br />Direction is poor Music is decent<br /><br />Salman khan just goes through the motions  Jackie is bad  Rani is as usual  Pooja is bad  Mohinish and Kashmira are nothing great Inder is awful,negative
"When I read the reviews of Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye  I thought  Huh?. It was THAT confusing. To be sure  I went to watch the film and what do you know? It's a remake of The Wedding Singer. Several scenes have been changed to suit the whole essence of Indianness  but the rest of it is a direct lift from the 1998 Hollywood hit. Bollywood is no stranger to remakes  but this is one so poor that it pains me just to watch it. I groaned so much watching this and I realized I wasn't the only one doing so! One guy actually walked out of the theater and never came back! Salman Khan should seriously stop doing comedy roles. He shrieks and whines too much. Why can't he just take it easy? He doesn't do justice to the role originally acted out by Adam Sandler. He doesn't have Sandler's sense of comic timing. Rani is a wonderful actress and one of my favorites  but she's no Drew Barrymore either. The scene where she stands in front of a mirror practicing to say her new surname (Hi, I'm Mrs Pugalia) doesn't match up to Barrymore's version (Hi, I'm Mrs Julia Gulia). I felt embarrassed watching that scene  even though I had loved the original. The music is not too bad. It's probably the only saving grace of this otherwise horrible film! Avoid this at all cost!",negative
There are no - NO redeeming qualities to this film. They didn't check a single fact - NOT ONE about... anything. I feel sorry for Larry Miller  and even more sorry for his agent for not being more capable for finding him a more suitable venue.<br /><br />The adults are all idiotic. The effects are cheesy and devoid of any sense of reality. The music is honestly cheesy. The plot is beyond belief.<br /><br />I you want to see something good with your family  see anything else. Take some time and check for mildew in your attic. My ten-year-old is mocking this film as we watch it. He's unfortunately learning that not every movie is worth watching.,negative
This is officially the terrible  boring  corny  and ridiculous movie ever created. The movie is all about a crazy kid and his friends  and they land a 747. His dreams are very corny and make no sense at all  and is very poorly done. Every special effect looks as if it was done without any modern technology  and might have been created by the kid that plays the leading role in the movie. If you watch this movie  it will definitely make you stupider. I advise you to never consider watching this movie  and if you do  good luck and don't miss the brain cells you killed off. My comment does not even fully grasp the awful creation from hell that has been made. The person that wrote the comment before me did not watch the same movie that I dreadfully watched  and wish I never watched. Peace.,negative
Formulaic slasher film  only this one stars three ten year olds (all born during a lunar eclipse) as the killers. Nice  huh? A little bit of gore and a nice nude scene may make this worthwhile for diehard fans of the genre  others beware.<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****,negative
Oh  how the critics fell all over themselves to praise their goldenboy Paul Schrader (author of Taxi Driver) when this movie came out. I never saw the qualities they were detecting when I watched this movie back in the day  so I re-viewed it  to see if I got it wrong. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. This is a chilly  unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture. The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy. And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to  hairsplitting about purity  the admiration of swords  etc.<br /><br />It must be a triumph when you learn you've landed Philip Glass; but then you have to get something out of him. Glasses score offers not a whit of distinction from his other work  nor does it provide the film any perceptible value. In 2010 it should be clear to anyone that Schrader squandered his career on work of no impact or importance (Cat People  AutoFocus  Light Sleeper  Patty Hearst  American Gigolo). He can bore you to pieces  and kill the momentum of a movie  quicker than anyone else. Schrader has made a resume full of lousy  amateurish films.,negative
Ocean's Twelve: just plain stupid  bad and nothing compared to the other two.<br /><br />An art robbery. 10 known actors  at least. A weak script and very slow developing idea. That's why I characterize a movie I only saw at least 20 minutes of it. Don't get me wrong  you may like it. But I only like the Ocean's films because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 it's not about Heist then what's the point to see it? Glad Soderberg saw his main error and redeemed himself by making a film far superior to the first one. Kudos for that.<br /><br />Steven Soderberg isn't really a good director. Apart from his hit Sex lies and videotapes... nothing else happened so much great to the career of this director. Shame on him. But his fault only.,negative
I enjoyed Oceans 11  I thought it was quite enjoyable  helped by the performances and the direction. However  I was disappointed with this film. Don't get me wrong  it is not a complete dud  thanks to the stellar performances from Brad Pitt  Catherine Zeta-Jones  George Clooney and Matt Damon especially and the efficient direction from Steven Soderbergh. However  the film really does suffer from truly lethargic pacing  some of the film was so slow I almost fell asleep between one key twist. Second  the plot is very convoluted and there are many twists and turns that makes it hard to keep up. The camera work wasn't as innovative as it was in the first movie either. Whereas in the first movie  it was smooth and professional  it was jerky and awkward here  and the music wasn't particularly memorable. The screenplay also wasn't as witty or as fun  and the film felt anti-climatic. At the end of the day it all felt a bit too lazy  despite the expert playing and direction. So much potential  but really a missed opportunity. 4/10 Bethany Cox,negative
What can I say about Ocean's Twelve? Who thought that it would ever come to this? A gigantic mess that loses itself halfway and can't retrace. I found myself amazed at how bad this really was. Really! I have never seen the ending properly because this film is just insufferable. I'm a huge fan of the first but this is a lame excuse for a sequel. <br /><br />What was the point of the heist if they were going to give the money back? The movie is just boring and so drag along that I can't ever sit through this. It really is bad. Just stay as far  repeat  far away as possible from this movie. It's worthless.,negative
Watching this movie brings several words to mind: sophomoric  ridiculous  improbable  self-indulgent and finally (and fatally)  boring. Badly directed  badly photographed and badly acted  the film is a confusing mess with plot lines (if one can call them that) veering in all directions. Someone may have used a five-year old's finger painting as a template. As punishment for this childish crime of a movie  this cast of stars should be spanked soundly and sent to their respective beds without dinner. . All in all  it seems like George needed an excuse to get together with his little buddies for a paid summer vacation and we're the suckers paying for it. Bad George! Bad!,negative
Comparing Oceans Twelve to the 2001 Oceans Eleven  did anyone else notice all the things that stayed the same?<br /><br />- All the stars returned for Twelve  and Zeta-Jones was added;<br /><br />- Twelve had the same director;<br /><br />- Twelve had the same producers;<br /><br />- Twelve had the same production designer;<br /><br />- Twelve had the same music director;<br /><br />- Twelve had the same film editor.<br /><br />Did anyone notice the things than changed once the Oceans franchise was established?<br /><br />- Twelve's budget was $25 million (30%) greater;<br /><br />- Eleven got great reviews  but Twelve largely got panned;<br /><br />- Eleven made $450 million but Twelve dropped to $362 million;<br /><br />- Domestic box office for Twelve dropped 32%;<br /><br />- Soderbergh teamed with a different screenwriter.<br /><br />Movies are a director's medium  of course. I almost forgot.,negative
I didn't expect a lot when i went out to see this  but my god what a disappointment. The original was kind of fun within it's genre  but this is so bad  i felt abused when i left the theater. There's no plot  it's not funny  it's not enjoyable to watch  it's straight out embarrassing. After an hour i hoped my patience would be rewarded but now i regret not leaving the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore this one  see it when it comes to the small screen. Or see it on budget DVD  whatever you do don't waste any money on it. Don't say i didn't warn you.,negative
"The people who bash this movie were looking for it to be as cool and slick as the first one  which this isn't. This movie was supposed to be the complete opposite as Ocean's 11. This has been said by a lot of the cast members and also the director  Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12  while it did lack a gripping plot  is being bashed because it was different then what people wanted. If it were released before Ocean's 11  it would be taken much differently  not as a failed sequel. The problem with sequels is people go into it with a preset idea of what it should be like it and have lots of expectations. They should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be Ocean's 11, again.",negative
Just like most people  I couldn't wait to see this Ocean's 11 sequel but it really stinks  I must say. It stinks because there's simply no good screenplay it was just cheap. I hope the producers donate all the money this movie has made (or will make) to the tsunami-victims in Asia so this movie will have at least one good reason to exist. It is so bad I even can't write a decent comment about it but....i still advise the creators of this thing to make Ocean's 13. Ocean's 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal a screenplay well hidden somewhere in Hollywood. The 13th member will be a foreign (maybe Russian) screenplay-writer who knows all tricks to write a copy of this well hidden screenplay  so they can replace the original they'll have to steal. Or they need to find at least 13 people to write a decent screenplay for a movie in which not only Julia Roberts plays herself but even all other star-members of the Ocean's-films. 13 People because it's the lucky number of Andy Garcia's character.,negative
"I've seen professional reviews claiming Julia Roberts playing herself was clever and very funny. I think NOT. An actress playing herself? And doing it with her same usual dizziness whenever she tries comedy? Talk about Hollyweird narcissism at it's utmost. Why doesn't she just stand there and go  Me, me, me. Look at me!. The director and writer should be shot for not thinking of something better then this in what could have been a charming sequel. and by the way Steven  when the audience starts paying more attention to the weird camera angles then the story you have a problem. Capra  Hitchcock  all used some creative cameras but they were talented enough not to lose the audience in them or just show off with the camera. You seem to have forgotten a cardinal rule of film-making in the name of style. The Pitt and Zeta Jones chemistry is quite good however  perhaps if they had made the film more focused around them and dispensed with the narcissism it might have worked. Once again Zeta Jones shows how she's got more talent and beauty then Roberts could dream of. Sadly  this film wastes talent and fails on many accounts. I want my money back.",negative
I hadn't planned on watching O12 because I didn't like O11 that much. I thought O11 was a nice but slightly boring little bank robbers movie with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyway I was talked into watching O12 one night and I regretted it a lot. The plot is not only boring but also senseless. I honestly don't even know what it was all about. I left the movie after 3 quarters and got some coffee with another girl who didn't like it. Much more pleasure I can tell you that. But even the guys who stayed till the end later reported to me that the plot continued being awful and useless. My advice: Don't watch. Go watch Team America (hilarious btw;-)) and forget about Ocean's Twelve.<br /><br />In my opinion the most boring and senseless peace of crap to be on the screen in years.,negative
Cover Girl is a lacklustre WWII musical with absolutely nothing memorable about it  save for its signature song  Long Ago and Far Away. This film came out before Gene Kelly really hit his artistic stride  and while there are evidences of his burgeoning talent here  mostly he plays sidekick to Rita Hayworth. And there's the problem. Rita Hayworth is gorgeous  no doubt about that. But she's simply not a compelling screen presence. I've always found myself wanting to like her more than I actually do  and this movie is no exception. She's simply not a very good actress  and she's not even a very good dancer. Good looking as she is  there's something vapid about her  and this movie suffers because of it.<br /><br />Grade: C-,negative
What a ridiculous waste of time and money!!!! This movie was the biggest loser of the year. All the hype was a warning. I am disappointed for Julia Roberts  by far she is the most talented cast member. I think her ability to truly act carried the film. The buddy buddy boys club was a little too phony  and to add insult to injury why bother to cast Catherine Zeta Jones? She only has the ability to ruin a film. She lacks the ability to have on screen chemistry with anyone  not to mention she lacks the ability to act. She lacks chemistry with the other characters: kind of reminiscent of America's Sweetheart's. She made The Terminal terminal. This movie is headed nowhere  what a shame  please please don't tell me 13 is on the way!,negative
Man I loved Ocean's 11.<br /><br />Smart movie. All eleven characters were crucial to the heist as each had their own specialised skill that was necessary to pull of the grand finale.<br /><br />What on earth was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume it's supposed to be Zeta-Jones but she wasn't really a part of the 11 as she was trying to trip them up and working against them the whole film?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones' characters boring relationship with some bits from the original movie thrown in just to get some bums on seats to watch the movie.<br /><br />With O-11  the gang were always a step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They were always able to outsmart him. What happened here? He catches up with them after a tip-off and suddenly they're all wusses? The whole movie is so that they can raise the money they stole plus interest to repay back Benedict for the heist they pulled on him 3 years earlier. So next movie they're going to develop courage and brains again and get him back for making them pay him back for the first heist? Puh-lease...<br /><br />This movie could have been achieved with just Brad Pitt  Zeta-Jones and 5 mins of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene.<br /><br />Slow moving movie  not the energy of the first one. I tried hard to like it and I'm usually very easy to please but I'm really disappointed.<br /><br />SPOILER!!! The twist - the whole movie didn't need to have been made as the real heist was done before everything you just saw over the past 2 hours.<br /><br />END SPOILER.<br /><br />Wait until it comes on TV or if you're a fan of the original from 2001 please don't watch this.,negative
I was watching this movie and getting increasingly bored with the silly plot that was going nowhere  when suddenly  the story takes a surreal turn for the worse and has an actor playing herself. Oh how I guffawed. Because it's sooooo funny  isn't it? We know Julia Roberts is playing the character of Tess  and here they are  in the film  cracking the joke that the character of Tess looks a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays someone impersonating Julia. How well she does this  we'll never know  because 99.999% of the audience don't actually know Julia Roberts personally (and reading about her in Hello magazine doesn't count). <br /><br />And then Bruce Willis turns up! Apparently  he's Julia Roberts' best friend. Well  he is in the film... how would I know whether or not Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts even know each other? I'm not in the least bit interested in the personal lives of actors - I just pay my money and expect them to do the job they're paid to do. Anyway they start cracking jokes about the plot twist in the film where Willis (rather unconvincingly) plays a psychiatrist... the one with the little kid in it... you know the one? I don't  I've forgotten what it's called. Willis even drops in a comment about how well that film did at the box office - how modest of you Mr Willis!<br /><br />The problem is that  not only are these scenes pointless and horribly horribly self-indulgent  it also remind us  the viewers  that we're simply watching a bunch of actors strutting around and getting paid vast sums of money for very little effort. You see  when I see a movie  I want to suspend disbelief and forget that I'm watching actors - I want to believe in the story I'm watching. When you start pulling the scenery down  mid- movie  you simply ruin the illusion for me.<br /><br />You know that a TV series has jumped the shark when it starts introducing celebrities  playing themselves (stand up and be counted The Simpsons  Friends  etc.)  but this is the first time I've seen a movie jump the shark. I usually stay away from movies like that (e.g. Scary Movie  The Naked Gun  etc.). The trouble is  I honestly never thought the Ocean's 11 films would go in this direction. What a shame.<br /><br />So with suspension of disbelief thrown out the window  and the plot now languishing in the movie then cracks the most wicked joke of all on the audience - the heist actually happened way back in the story  and the final 90 minutes or so of the film was pointless posturing. Yes  that's right: Steven Soderwhatsit and his actor friends all get up  point at us the audience and say  Ha haaa... you've all been had... thanks for your money!. Then they give us the single fingered salute.<br /><br />Well  right back at you. I didn't actually pay to see this movie... I downloaded the DVD for nothing. How d'ya like them apples? Now THAT'S a plot twist.,negative
This was the biggest disappointment of a movie...:( Sucks  cos I was really looking forward to it.<br /><br />All the twists were crap. They were ALL flashbacks!!! <br /><br />What makes a good heist movie is the BELIEVABILITY of the the job. Yes it has to be surprising so the audience is stunned  but if you walk away and go that's bulls#!t... what's the point? <br /><br />Plus the main heist was a bag snatch anyway! You didn't get to see the team operating at it's full deceptive and brilliant potential. There was not even ONE good heist in this movie! They were all rubbish.. including that french idiot's break dancing crap to get through the lasers... it's easy to do that when they are composited in afterwards! Plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie.. and it was stupid then as well...<br /><br />Also  there's no reason to have even HALF of the 12 or 11 in this movie! What difference do half of the cast really make to the outcome of this movie??? Half the SCENES don't even need to be there! <br /><br />The first one was classy. This was CHEAP! And it makes the whole team loose credibility. Especially Ocean himself for bowing down the Bennett.,negative
I had read the newspaper reviews of this film and I must say my expectations were very low before watching Ocean's 12. I really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. I would rate it top 5 of the worst movie I have ever seen. Why do I say that? First of all there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be assigned the term story is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive. The entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times.<br /><br />The actors show up but doesn't do anything to deserve any credit or appraise. Most embarrassing are leading ladies (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) that either overplay or are extremely plain. Damon  Clooney and Pitt aren't brilliant either. To be honest I really don't understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie.<br /><br />=== May contains spoilers ==== Camera and editing  sigh where should I begin. There are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful. Combine that with extremely untactful editing and you start looking for a wooden spoon to carve your heart out. Especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car. The camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message: wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects - NOT. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) playing Julia Roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess. Bruce Willis. Why? Please explain it to me! WHY???<br /><br />To summarize ... if you have to choose between root canal work and watching Ocean's 12 I recommend the former. Make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it ...,negative
Ocean's 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on. Like a celebrity awards presentation  each major actor/actress is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking applaud now sign. The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed  poorly edited  and at times  utterly unrelated to the story and confusing. Speaking of the story ...there is one  kinda ...but its barely visible for all the look at me shots and cameos. Only Matt Damon seemed to actually act during this film...the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session. As for the heist  the action  the drama....it was put into the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!,negative
I felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined IMDb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a while.<br /><br />The acting/direction/other-areas of the movie are fantastic. I love brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The witty banter was still there too from the first movie. My question is how in the world did they let this script out of the drafting process? I thought that not only did the plot develop like a slug racing to the end of the sidewalk  but that twist? (can i call it that) was so incredibly stupid that i wanted to go demand a refund from the ticket booth. I have never felt so played and used from a movie in my entire life. Here i was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry  good acting  good direction  amazing plot) only to find that they had taking my 8 dollars and made a mockery out of it.<br /><br />The part that gets me still is that this movie has now grossed more than 125 million dollars.<br /><br />In summary  I felt that this movie insulted my intelligence. I still feel like the only part the writers concentrated on was that little bit with Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.,negative
Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches up with Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him (in Oceans 11) plus interest. He holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief  the Night Fox. The team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay Benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the Night Fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever. Put simply  this film is a complete mess. The masses may argue that it is cool and that Clooney and Pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to Hello magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is convoluted  it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns  it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent (Hello magazine readers). Any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is. Whilst Oceans 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent pace  was stylish and had some decent twists and turns. This movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up. It is as if the director and cast said to themselves  hey this isn't really working out  lets just have a laugh! Indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but I was not. I will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes where Julia Roberts impersonates herself (with Bruce Willis undertaking a cameo role) whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The movie is so full of plot holes that it as if Arnie has emptied an Uzi 9mm into the film studio. Credit can only be given to some scenes where the Night Fox uses Caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie. The final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor; this accurately sums up the movie. Stick with the original.,negative
Unfortunately I think this is one of those films that if you or I took it to the studio and said  'can I make this great movie with my friends Mary  Mungo and Midge from school?' the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot. However  if a bunch of massive Hollywood names say  'look  I fancy a jaunt to Italy with my mates  how about it?' the studio writes a cheque.<br /><br />We kick off with the casino boss from Ocean's 11 tracking down the robbers who made off with his cash  and then Brad Pitt is shagging Catherine Zeta Jones  and then there's some monkeying about in Amsterdam and Italy and such and such and then it all ends somehow.<br /><br />The film does  however  include the most shameful moment of both Julia Roberts' and Bruce Willis' careers  which is a cinematic gem. I nearly vomited in my lap and tore my eyes out when Julia Roberts  playing Tess in the movie  pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis stands about clearly wondering when he can leave  and how much the cheque will be.<br /><br />Ah well  to be fair  I'd have done it for the cash  so I suppose I can't really criticize the poor loves  but I'm a penniless slob not a Hollywood legend. I guess what really annoys me about this film is not that it is boring and pointless and has a terrible story  but that I think the actors probably all had good fun doing it! I think the actor's entire job is to project emotion outwards...I feel like I paid to go to the party  but had to stand outside in the rain. Booo!<br /><br />Watch it if you like Como  or fancy CZJ or something  but otherwise go for a walk.,negative
Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer named Rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues; she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine  but her impending success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) has smitten boss Gene Kelly chomping at the bit. Terribly tired piece of Technicolor cotton candy  with unmemorable musical sketches (the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s  with Hayworth portraying her own grandmother). Kelly  as always  dances well but acts with false sincerity; when he's serious  he's insufferable  and the rest of the time he's flying on adrenaline. The script is a lead weight  not even giving supporting players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden any good lines. *1/2 from ****,negative
SPOILER!! Terrible camera work  horrible writing  non-existent plot  and numerous plot wholes. Wonderful acting! Except for Julia Roberts. Who poorly plays someone who is impersonating Julia Roberts  poorly. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this movie.<br /><br />During the movie  we repeatedly zoom in  on each of the twelve (!) characters. Twelve is too many  even for a classic like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is  we tediously zoom in on the characters  when all of them are in the same room  doing the same thing.<br /><br />Yep  Clooney's eating. Yep  Pitt's eating. Yep  the Jew is eating. Yep  the geek is eating. Yep  the bodybuilder's eating. Yep  Mr. Sensitive is eating. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep--Yep. Yep. Phew! This happens at least three other times in the movie. Yep  they're all sitting in cars  bored. Yep  they're all getting arrested  frightened. Yep  they're all being led out of a jail  depressed.<br /><br />But it wasn't until I was home that I realized how badly they'd got me on this one. This is a heist movie  right? That's what I went to see  right? But when I walked in and set my car keys in the change jar  only then I realized: NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY STOLEN IN THIS MOVIE! That's right. It's a heist movie  where nothing gets stolen. Oh  they try. They go to try and steal some boring document or something  from some guy's house (whatever)  and it turns out it's already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life  wasted. Then they try to steal some egg from some museum (YAWN!)  and they screw that up and get arrested.<br /><br />Then we see how some fairy french guy stole the egg even before they did  and we get all the joy of Entrapment  except this time the person inside the tight catsuit dancing around the fake lasers is... an ugly skinny french guy. Um.<br /><br />But it turns out he didn't actually steal the egg either. Actually  our heroes stole the egg  LOOOONG ago  in another movie entirely  which would have been a GREAT movie to watch  had they made that movie.<br /><br />Instead we see a 30 second clip in black-and-white about how they robbed some college student of his back-pack. You heard me... the daring caper  the ultimate heist-- the buildup of this 2 and a half hours of utter boring crap-- is them stealing a back-pack from a college student  by creatively getting into a fight over baseball teams and distracting him  and replacing his back-pack with an identical back-pack? What?? <br /><br />Ugh. I'm telling you  this was so bad  I didn't even realize just how bad it was-- just how badly I'd been robbed-- until I got home.,negative
"Every James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has ITS own set of rules. And the fact that screenwriters don't break these rules maintains the integrity of the characters. With a completely unnecessary plot twist  the integrity of both Ocean films plummets somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon.<br /><br />Imagine what would happen  while teetering on the rope bridge outside of the Temple of Doom  if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry because throughout the entire first two movies he's secretly had super powers and can fly them both to safety.<br /><br />Entertaining? Sure  for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done that because it would have destroyed the integrity of the film. More importantly  it would have ANGERED the audience. They'd already sat on the edge of their seats through 3 hours worth of Indiana Jones movies and they were counting on Indiana to get them off that bridge in a believable way. If he were to fly off? People would have walked out of the theaters the same way people did during Ocean's 12.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />1. Julia Roberts'character  Tess  infiltrates a museum by disguising herself as...Julia Roberts?!? A clever twist? By breaking the fourth wall three hours after we've been introduced to these characters? Is this the Naked Gun 33 and 1/3? It's a textbook example of how a cheap laugh can ruin an entire film. But wait...just in case you haven't walked out yet...<br /><br />2. The suspense builds throughout the last hour of the movie -- how will they pull off the heist -- there are only 10...8...5...2 DAYS LEFT! And then in the last 12 minutes of the film  the ONLY entertaining part of this movie  we see that the heist was made days earlier and took Matt Damon all of 30 seconds to pull off. The past 10 days? A complete waste of your time.<br /><br />BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE ROPE BRIDGE...Just relax, Willie! I stole the REAL stones back about a month ago! Besides, I convinced them you were Kate Capshaw!<br /><br />If you haven't already seen it  cut your losses and go see the Polar Express. I don't want to ruin the ending for you  but there really is a Santa Claus. Most importantly  you won't feel cheated leaving the theater.",negative
I had very high hopes walking into this movie. After all  Ocean's 11 was a truly great Hollywood product. Its rapid-fire jokes  incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films I have ever seen. Of course  with all the money it made  a sequel was on the way  and I  for one  was excited.<br /><br />Needless to say  I was absolutely blown away by this movie. Blown away by how horribly wrong things can go. This movie had everything going for it; the return of the entire original cast  the same director  news stories of crazy on- and off-set antics. How could it possibly have gone so wrong?<br /><br />It starts immediately with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there. After reasonably goofy short scenes between Pitt/Zeta-Jones and Clooney/Roberts  the film spends several minutes watching Andy Garcia waltz from scene to scene  telling each individual member of Danny Ocean's original eleven that he wants his money back. Believe me when I say that these scenes are only here to pad Andy Garcia's running time  because without these ridiculously awkward shots  his screen time would be WELL under five minutes.<br /><br />This leads me to another major qualm I had with this film. The pacing is so uneven that characters are dropped completely from the story  and only sometimes brought back later. Bernie Mac's character is dropped from the script early on  and never comes back except for 2 short scenes with no dialogue. Garcia appears for the first few minutes  and returns for an exceptionally brief scene at the end. Roberts shows up for about 5 minutes at the beginning  and isn't even mentioned again until there's about 20-25 minutes left. Even Clooney himself spends a large chunk of the film in prison.<br /><br />This would all be excusable if the film was funny. At all. 90% of the jokes fall completely flat and the ones that do work are worth a chuckle at best. The plot is undeniably worthless  and left me feeling cheated. At one point in the film  the team takes on a job worth $2.5 million of the nearly $100 million they need to raise before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even acknowledge how absurd wasting the time to do this job is  but they do it anyway! Over 30 minutes of the film revolve around this job that they shouldn't even be doing  and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to pad the running time. Furthermore  the equipment they use to pull this job off CLEARLY cost millions upon millions to fund. Just wait until you see what they do to pull this job and realize it would cost far more than $2.5 million to pull off. Obviously  because of this  they have to pull off several jobs to make the money. The beauty of the first film was the one big con and how ingeniously and intricately it was pulled off. Here  they pull so many jobs  in so many different ways  that they rush through all of them because to explain them would make the film several hours long.<br /><br />We all know walking into this film that there will be a big twist at the end. Thus is the nature of the caper film. The twist at the end of Ocean's Twelve made me laugh; not because it was funny  but because I couldn't believe how cheated I felt. I won't give it away  because I know most of you will be foolish enough to throw down the money to see this movie anyway.<br /><br />What I will say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you have sat through already completely irrelevant.<br /><br />I was excited to see this film  after absolutely adoring Ocean's 11. I left the theater feeling like I had been the victim of a truly great con pulled by the cast and crew of this movie in tricking me into thinking that this movie would actually be worth watching. I have never given a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com  but there's a first time for everything. Consider yourselves warned....1/10,negative
I thought it was comedy!! What a hoot! I can't believe Forsythe or Reynolds would actually appear in this piece of trash..And then there's the beautiful Erika Eleniak or whatever this piece of eye candy is called..Appears she put on a few pounds since her Playboy centerfold..Like about 50!! The story line is ludicrous  the acting absolutely horrendous  and the tired old cliché's that are run over and over and over again  boy it took a lot of stamina to sit through this dog..The only thing worth it was the LAUGHS!! And there are PLENTY! If you really want to kill say  an hour and a half pick this baby up at the rental shop  but make sure you have a room full of brain dead people to watch it with you. I think that's who it was written for.. it plays like they were thinking of a real low rent  drug induced audience for this one..,negative
QUESTION: How does a film merit two different titles like The Librarians and Strike Force? <br /><br />ANSWER: The film is sooooooooo bad that the filmmakers couldn't even decide on a title!!!! <br /><br />This film is a hodgepodge of martial arts  death wish-vendettas  melodrama  romance  and other cliché film techniques. The story focuses on a vigilante group called The Librarians led by Agent Simon (WIlliam Forsythe). The group is hot in pursuit of a nefarious  multi-lingual  pockmarked creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff) who captures women and holds them hostage in the lawless urban world of south Florida. <br /><br />Burt Reynolds appears as a cameo in this film  and his scene is entirely extraneous to the action. Burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest drawls I have ever heard. This may have been Burt's attempt at an Irish dialect  but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of Marlon Brando in The Godfather. <br /><br />Also appearing in this film is Erika Eleniak  who has infiltrated the inner circle of Marcos' bizarre world. Erika's character kick-boxes her way into an alliance with Simon. The Librarians and Erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable TV converter box.,negative
All things old are new again.Erika E. is on celebrity fitness (VH1);Florida State Rep. Mark Foley is the national buzz for allegedly sending sexually explicit Emails to a 16 yr. old male page.As I edit this Mr.Foley is resigning from his representative seat. Mr.Foley you see does his turn at acting as the father of the recovered girl seen during the opening sequence. My place in movie history will forever be solidified with my appearance in the graveyard scene.I should have looked at this as a omen.I hate to say it but be warned If you place this in your DVD be prepare to put your toe on the trigger of the shotgun you'll soon have between your teeth. Your level of depression has reached its zenith.I have seen better writing put to screen on an Etch a Sketch.Shot in 1999-00 under the working title The Librarians in and around Palm Beach Co.Why the Librarian's you ask well you would need to be wrapped as tight as binding to be able to read anything into this frat party of over the hill stunt men plying their trade onto celluloid for one last time.Oh well enough with the accolades...Burt Reynolds as a Irish mobster  in Miami no less...possibly the worst forced accent impression since Linda Lovelace in Deep Throat. .William Forsythe as a hip  slick and cool tough guy...doubtful possibly 10 years ago.I'd say it's curtain time for Mike Kirton.You now have the Forsythe to pass up this sub par movie more like a film school project  for anything on tape disc or paper your local retailer has to offer.,negative
As stated by others  this is a ludicrously horrible movie (NOT A FILM!). It is not bad in a funny way  just painful to try to endure. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />Erika Eleniak is pretty hot  but there is one scene where she is in a bathtub  and you can see the wrap covering her breasts under the bubbles. Also  she's getting fat.<br /><br />The fight scenes are so bad as to be unwatchable  if you know or care anything about martial arts  or even decent choreography  and the editing/effects are abysmal.<br /><br />There is no payoff  it goes nowhere  and sucks getting there.,negative
I heard the stories of the ravers in the movie and thats great but that is only 1/100 of the movie. The problem with this movie is the cheesiness. I never really got the plot or why the guy was stealing girls. That makes no sense but hey...why they were in a club randomly was curious also. Many parts of this movie make no sense but overall I was interested. It was confusing on many levels...maybe I am just not indie enough for this movie but judging from the B looking end scene they ran out of money  just cut some stuff in  and forgot about the plot. Its low budget and appears so. I like the fact that they used little special effects which were bad  but they used none that were quality. I would say this film is the quintessential bad script  with alright production. It is definitely not as random as many movies I have seen but the pieces of the puzzle just don't make sense together. In effects  I would give exception to the final battle when all the effects went 1950's on my ass. Sparks out of models and the like. Watch it if you like an unintentional comedy from an action movie. Mystery science theater has a candidate.,negative
Recap: Simon leads a little team of special agents that has specialized in finding and returning missing people  against all possible odds. Their latest mission is about the granddaughter of a friend of them. She seems to have been caught in the web of a particularly brutal criminal and everyone that has gone looking for her has gone missing. But now The Librarians are on the case.<br /><br />Comments: This is pure B-action  through and through. The key phrase for this is unlimited supply. There is unlimited supply of ammunition  they don't have to reload once. There is an unlimited supply of bad guys  so the heroes have something to shoot at. There is an unlimited supply of breasts  many of them bare  in an vain (and as always failed) attempt to distract from the plot holes. And there is an unlimited supply of bad acting (it is almost like Erika Eleniak's performance shines in this  what about that?)  and actors that don't seem to care more than the paycheck (and why should they when no one else seem to?).<br /><br />And as in most B-action movies there are an unlimited supply of bad gunfights. But these almost seem to be of a ridiculously bad kind. I think I saw more realistic gunfights when I played cowboy as a kid.<br /><br />But then again I didn't really expect much either  how could I from a action movie named The Librarians? And it actually delivers about what could be expected. 90 minutes of more or less bad action with some scenes to connect the dots between. But I am unsure if I can call it entertaining  it didn't keep my interest very long.<br /><br />3/10,negative
Like a terrible cancer raining out of the sky  I wandered into this crock on some movie channel the other night. Being a fan of bad movies  and actively engaging in the purchasing and viewing of said bad film  i was intrigued by the idea of a genuinely terrible looking action movie coming from modern times. After that wore off though  I found my hands inexplicably turning against me  grabbing at anything in range and stabbing about my head and neck. Something sinister was in that tape...err...where was I...anyway this ranks among the more embarrassingly bad pieces of film I've run across. William Forsythe can't play more than one character  and that character is always a walking joke. Even when set into a comic background and given things to do and say that are supposed to be funny (ala Deuce Bigalo) he's laughable in the wrong way. Erika Eleniak is much the same  having starred in her fair share of terrible movies and done terrible jobs in all of them  she doesn't fail to help scum up this one. Classic b-movie villain guy Andrew Divoff does a respectable job but barely even has any scenery to chew on. Even reliable standby for b-movie action Daniel Bernhardt fails to deliver anything bordering on entertainment. As for the film's own merits  the plot is lame  the script  just like the action and the plot movement  is both dull and...well  stupid  for lack of a better adjective(lord knows they didn't put any effort into it  why should I?).<br /><br />Anyone who has seen enough movies has seen some bad ones  and anyone who has seen enough bad ones can learn to appreciate them  but there is simply nothing here to be enjoyed unless you are among the most bad movie tolerant and simply feel so inclined as to test your mettle. Before you do though  take it from me  this one isn't even terrible enough to be enjoyed (unlike say...some of the more ludicrous Italian zombie films). A fan of b-movie action would be much better off checking out most any of Bernhardt's other films  or pretty much anything else that has ever been put to film for that matter. America simply is not the place to go to for action it seems  especially not now. If you have a craving  check out anything from over the seas  films like Heroic Duo or the slightly less normal Hakaider(along with anything else in the awesome Keita Amemiya's cannon) will provide a lot more fun and way better action than your apt to find elsewhere  especially here.,negative
I'm not going to bother mentioning any of the plot - this is strictly a B movie on its way to obscurity. The shock to me  though  is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film. Erika Eleniak  never anything you'd call a thespian anyway  seems to have morphed into Anna Nicole Smith (in her Big period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear. He's always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess  as seen in the Bloodsport series (also B movies but  if you like martial arts  eminently watchable). Here  he is a shell of his former self - sure  he's older  but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested ... I just don't get it. Don't these people invest? William Forsythe is another heavy that I've always liked  but his last several roles are what you would call mailing it in. I'm not going to even mention Mr. Reynolds - his gig here amounts to a throwaway  nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff  as usual a creepy  evil  pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk - the best kind! This is a movie you watch for laughs. There's nothing else to it.,negative
OK  imagine that every state in the US  nay  every country has exactly the same trees growing and ground foliage. Imagine  also  that a monkey-trapper's camp so far off the beaten track you had to do the first half of the approach by river has a beautifully tarmac'd  perfectly straight road leading up to it. Imagine a world where you have to wear a full biohazard suit to collect a floppy disk  then you just drop it in a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket with no precautions as soon as you get back to the office. A world where two nine-year old girls are happy to give lots of blood without complaining. This is the world this movie is set in.<br /><br />On top of that  it's one of the most cliché-ridden pieces of excrement it's been my misfortune to witness in many a year.<br /><br />I liked it. :),negative
I've been hearing a lot of this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in South East Asia over the last three years . Apparently it's on the thresh hold of mutating into something very contagious and millions upon millions of people are going to be wiped out in a global pandemic . Just thought I'd mention this in case you haven't got round to writing your will yet .<br /><br />I'd also thought I'd mention it since I was watching something called CARRIERS tonight which wasn't about naval warfare but opens with a scene that's a cross between OUTBREAK and an episode of THE X FILES I saw many years ago . I thought I'd be watching something with added resonance after hearing the stories about the danger posed by bird flu but after the not unimpressive opening CARRIERS descends into a cheap and cheerful TVM and like every other TVM you'll see the lead characters are female   one of which is a ballsy authority figure while the other lead female is a mother of young children . It goes without saying there's a sick child subplot too <br /><br />What is irritating about the TVM format is that it overwhelms the potential of what could have been quite a good film if it was made for cinema . There's a fairly gory scene of someone coughing blood all over a nurses face and a very impressive jay walker getting run down stunt but these bits are quickly forgotten as the mood descends into family sentiment since this - And just about every other TVM ever made - was made for an essentially female audience,negative
I've watched the first 15 minutes and I can tell that there was no consultation with any military type personnel. Judith Light's charactor (an officer) has her hair down past her shoulders! One of the first officers that greets her as she walks in to the medical facility she works at is so overweight that his pant pockets gap! No - there was no military advising them on this movie. Even an ex-military enlisted could have assisted here.,negative
How can you make a joke about Mafia? It is not the kind of subject to laugh at! A near movie cannot make me laugh  because I am comparing it to Jane Austen's Mafia!. Mafia! wasn't a good movie but Hoods is really worse! In Mafia!  there were some good jokes but in this one there are maybe two or three...that make you smile. Not too bad actors but very bad scenario!! We sure prefer something serious like The Godfather. I give it * out of *****.,negative
Hoods doesn't deliver the goods. This half-baked mafia comedy boasts a stellar cast  including Joe Mantegna  Kevin Pollack  Joe Pantoliano  Jennifer Tilly  and Seymour Cassel  along with a number of faces familiar to those who watch crime movies  but it is truly a misfire if there ever was one. Writer & director Mark Malone  best known for writing Dead of Winter for Bonnie & Clyde director Arthur Penn  has penned up a pedestrian potboiler that has an ailing but vengeful mob boss Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel) dispatching his son Angelo (Joe Mantegna of House of Games) to whack Carmine DellaRosa. It seems that a rival mob fire-bombed one of Pop's warehouses (in the opening scene) and Martinelli wants payback. Trouble is that nobody has a clue as to who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mob comedy  such a complication might be amusing  but here is just plain flat. Angelo and a carload of wiseguys  including his best pal Rudy (Kevin Pollack of Deterrence) spend half of the time trying to find out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to perform the hit  so they track down a crazy mob hit-man Charlie (Joe Pantoliano of Bad Boys) to do the dirty deed. Before they can convince Charlie to make the hit  they have to locate him  and Charlie's slutty wife Mary (Jennifer Tilly of Bound) reveals that he is locked up in a mental hospital. Our misfit heroes cruise out to the mental hospital and break Charlie out. About half of the movie is over before they discover that Carmine is a kid in short pants (Vincent Berry) who is bland and harmless. Indeed  Carmine has the only decent line in the movie. As our brainless bunch of heroes wheel away from his house with him in the backseat to take care of business  Carmine warns them that they need to get him home in time or his father will kill him. Charlie tries to ice the urchin but he cannot. Instead  he reconnects with his feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor. Meanwhile  after Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine  the kid gets his paws on the pistol and pops off several aimless rounds. Angelo and he struggle over the automatic. The pistol slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground  goes off  and blows a hole in Rudy's chest. Now  keep in mind that Rudy never wanted to shoot the kid in the first place  and Angelo and he argued over the wrong-headedness of the hit. So Rudy winds up on the ground with a fatal wound  while Angelo struggles to stop the bleeding. Talk about a dull death scene. Angelo is conflicted himself because his father ordered the hit and Angelo fears that dad will do him in if he doesn't execute orders. There is a flashback subplot about Angelo's father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides some insight into Angelo's reluctance to pack a gun.<br /><br />There is nothing remotely redeeming about this depressing comedy with a downer of an ending. Things gets worse  and if you last through this 90 minute nonsense  you'll see what I mean. The comedy is largely laugh-less. Good actors wallow in sketchy roles that aren't even funny. Perhaps director Malone was trying to do another comedy like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. If he was  he missed by a mile. Big-breasted Jennifer Tilly shows cleavage and snarls through a couple of scenes with Mantegna  but she doesn't do much of anything else. She's the stereotypical slut who doesn't even get naked. A paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast  otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish. Initially  I had hoped that this might be a Ransom of Red Chief knockoff where the kid drives the wiseguys nuts  but no such luck here. Of course  the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a kid  but it's not the kind of a surprise that makes you want to watch it up to its resolution.<br /><br />I actually bought this movie on a Canadian DVD labelSevilleand it contains only the most basic special features. If you hate previews that give away the plot  don't watch the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna  one of your first questions should be why he helped to produce this yawner. It is neither hilarious nor dramatic. There are no quotable lines  and none of the characters stand out as either interesting or sympathetic. The Seville DVD presents the movie in full frame with no subtitles or closed captioning.,negative
Jefferey dahmer was one sick guy. There's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said  except that the many documentaries  and films made about him are probably better than this one. It's Ridiculously cheesy. It's so cheesy  a guy who posted the whole film on youtube added some annotations to make the viewer laugh.<br /><br />Carl Crew (Who's he?) stars as Serial killer Jeffrey dahmer  Who's killing spree began in 1978 with a young guy dahmer just wanted to be friends with  a finally in 1991 with a man he wished to have sex with  and eat.<br /><br />I didn't bother to watch the whole film through. it's basically a documentary that shows all the attacks dahmer pulled off before he got caught. And since this film was made in 1993  one year before dahmer was bludgeoned to death by a fellow inmate  The death of dahmer isn't shown. but it Probably would've been as cheesy as this cheese-fest.<br /><br />1/10,negative
***Possible spoilers***<br /><br />I've read up on Dahmer a little and saw the new Dahmer film (with the same name) at an earlier time. This movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings  too little on Dahmer himself. The film called Dahmer had the opposite problem  it was too little about his crimes and too much about himself.<br /><br />I did not find the acting to my satisfaction  it had a certain amateur feel too it  especially the probation officer. It also seemed as if the Dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor. But I might be wrong about that.<br /><br />What annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show the real deal about what he did anyway. That is ok - but what I then don't understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while Dahmer was out getting beer  was not depicted being naked  since that is also how it happened. It's not a big deal  but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out. What wasn't shown either or not even really hinted was Dahmers sexual obsession with the dead. Again  I don't mind they didn't SHOW it  but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehow.<br /><br />Conclusion: I think the really good Dahmer film is still to be made  a movie that incorporates not only Dahmers crimes but also who he was  and why he did what he did. I think that 1.5 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all. This movie was just a cutout (excuse the pun) of Dahmers life and personality and does not give you any 'close to good' insight into his life or personality.<br /><br />4/10,negative
The Secret Life starts with the worst possible narrative intro: The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too horrible to make a film about.... Okay  so what are you suggesting? That we shouldn't bother to continue watching as the film won't be accurate or bloody  anyway? And they were right  too! The film isn't the least bit shocking and contains almost no blood or gore at all. Although I think that's mainly due to the low budget production values and not because of Dahmer's crimes being too horrific. Basically  The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer is just one sequence repeated over and over again. Young  pitiful and mentally confused Jeffrey picks up victims (always males  as he was a homosexual)  kills them and then talks about how it wasn't his intention to hurt them and about how lonely he is. This gets boring really quick and even the admirable performance by unknown actor Carl Crew can't save this movie from being a total dud. Still  this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly muddled Dahmer that got released in 2002.,negative
This movie has been done before. It is basically a unoriginal combo of Napoleon Dynamite and Sordid Lives. There are some funny bits  but otherwise it is a cliché bore. It is a good first film attempt and the director (who also stars in and wrote the feature) shows a lot of promise. But the writing was kind of choppy and the story was not very original. I swear I had heard some of the lines in other films. However  the acting was very good and the film was shot in an interesting way. It is also refreshing to see gay-themed movies not be so bogged down with political correctness and tired stories of angst. The main character seemed fairly well adjusted for a gay teen in rural Texas so no saccharine  coming out drama here!,negative
I wasted enough time actually WATCHING this chore of a movie  I don't want to waste more writing a big review. Not once did I so much as crack a smile. ALL the jokes were boring  forced and lacked any kind of wit. I kept saying  wheres the punchline? Almost every single character was an obnoxious stereotype and all the situations were clichéd and half the time there wasn't even any kind of solution. Things just happened to get to the next scene. For the life of me I can't understand how this got as many good reviews as it did. If you like clunky acting and poorly composed film making Fat Girls is the movie for you.,negative
"Rita Hayworth is just stunning at times and  for me  the only reason to watch this silly film. Despite the overdone 1940s lipstick  Rita was one of the all-time glamor women of Hollywood. In fact  for a couple of years I can't imagine anyone that looked better  except maybe Elizabeth Taylor in her prime.<br /><br />Anyway  the co-star of the show  Gene Kelly  does not play his normal likable  at least the kind of guy we all know him from in Singin' In The Rain. Here  Kelly's Danny McGuire pouts much of the time. Phil Silvers  who I loved on TV at Sgt. Bilko, is so stupid in here as Genius you will just cringe listening to his dumb jokes....and they are stupid.<br /><br />The visuals are good with great Technicolor  which almost looks terrific. You get to see a lot of pretty women in here  too  not just Hayworth. Unfortunately  the story isn't all that much. It centers around Hayworth deciding about a career choice. Along the way  we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insultingly-dumb ending. All in all  an unmemorable film  except as a showcase for Hayworth's beauty.",negative
The premise of the film was very promising - sort of a gay Napoleon Dynamite type of film. And to be fair  there were some funny moments and funny lines but it really wasn't very good overall. The script and dialog felt like a local sketch production  full of clichés and scenes that were predictable.<br /><br />However  there was enough that was amusing  that I stuck around to see how it finished  since there were hints that something special happens at the end. But it seems that either the film ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt  almost skipping directly from what looked to be the key conflict in the film to the final credits.<br /><br />Overall  it was very disappointing but not completely unwatchable...,negative
Fat Girls is among the worst films within the indie gay genre.<br /><br />The premise is promising: an average-looking gay teen is trapped in a repressive small TX town. His only kindred spirits are the other village HS misfits: the class 'fat girl'  a naïve immigrant from Cuba  and the sensitive drama teacher. So far  interesting. In theory  this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a built-in audience---the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across America and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand  peppered with a dose of self-deprecating humor.<br /><br />Unfortunately  rather than a nuanced dramedy  Ash Christian approaches his autobiographical subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor. The result is a cast of unlikeable  derivative  two-dimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward. Sabrina (Fink) is a quasi-Goth bitter navel-gazer. She is such a prickly  unsympathetic person; there is little doubt as to the reason for her friendless condition. The chemistry between her and Rodney (Christian) registers zero. This may have been bad casting  but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply unsalvageable. Consequently  one is left wondering when there is such a non-existent bond  what could possibly warrant their near-constant companionship throughout the story.<br /><br />Sabrina's newfound boyfriend  Rudy (de Jesus)  and Rodney's mother Judy (Theaker) are among the most exaggerated of the clichéd stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films. Rudy is the horny undersexed immigrant/nerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent comedy ever made within the realm of TV or film. Judy is the born-again obsessed with Jesus- talk and big hair. Just when you thought the Tammy Faye thing had been done to death  Christian inserts a scene where Judy's mascara is running with her tears! Is there anyone in the civilized world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad nauseum for 20 years?<br /><br />In addition to the failed attempts at sardonic humor  there are many puzzling story inconsistencies. Rodney considers himself a fat ugly loser. However  he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular impromptu trysts with the ubiquitous school jock/hunk  Ted (Miller). Although these liaisons are devoid of emotional fulfillment  most gay teens (filled with raging testosterone  just like their hetero brethren) would find this to be a rather enviable arrangement given the more common alternative of involuntary celibacy.<br /><br />Rodney finds an object for his affection in Bobby (Bruening)  an exotic transplant from England. Against all believable odds  the lad not only happens to land in this tiny TX hamlet  but is conveniently openly gay to boot. Like Sabrina  Bobby is an icy  angry smart aleck and the viewer is left head-scratching as to his magnetic appeal. <br /><br />Much to his delight  Rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar  where Bobby claims to be the DJ. Upon arrival  the boyfriend-to-be promptly leaves Rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man. This is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since Rodney's feeling as an outcast are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a parochial town. As tiny as the town is  they have openly gay students at the high school? A secretly bisexual football captain? Lesbian moms? A Gay teacher? and it has a gay bar downtown (patronized by attractive men  no less)? Apparently  the place is not so backwater after all.<br /><br />Ten years earlier  Todd Stephens' Edge of Seventeen covered nearly the same material with a much more creative  honest  touching  and humorous film.,negative
I checked this out at the Vancouver International Film Festival and was not impressed.<br /><br />The only area of the film I enjoyed was the commentary on film-making. For the most part  this film seemed random and somewhat fantastical (I don't say that in a complimentary way  however) and just silly. It was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life  which may sounds intriguing in some films  but the fantasy merely seemed needlessly perverse.<br /><br />My criticism of this film is not upon the actors  rather the story itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted my money back  but considering it was a Film Festival  that wasn't about to happen.,negative
This would have to rate as one of the worst films of all time. The film screened at the Italian Film Festival in Melbourne  Australia. After the screening  not only did I want my money refunded  I wanted the 1.5 wasted hours of my life back too. I have a very broad tolerance level when it comes to the indulgences of some European film-making  but this is one of those films that is selected for festivals based on the reputation of the filmmaker alone. This film is proof that while such selections may satisfy the egos of the film-maker and the selection panel  there is absolutely no joy for the audience. There is no character development whatsoever  the plot is a garbled mess  the style is nonsensical  the shot selection is appalling  and the editing is worse. By the end of the first reel  you'll wonder if you walked into the wrong cinema  and by the end of the third reel  you'll be begging to be put out of your misery. This film is an abomination.,negative
I agree that this film is too pretentious  and it is not easy to know where it is going. I have been teaching literature and film for many years  and I find this film to be one of the most over rated  according to some of the previous reviews here. <br /><br />However  let me remind you that this is the same director who has L'ora di religione (Il sorriso di mia madre- My Mother's Smile) to his credit -- a gem of a film! <br /><br />Was he trying to outdo Fellini's 81/2 here???? The scene with the dogs  which has also been pointed out  is absurd and excessive  just one example. Others would take too much space  and some reviewers have already noted them. <br /><br />Overall  a most frustrating and annoying experience!,negative
The film made no sense to me whatsoever. Good actors(SergioCastellittoaparticular favourite; he was great in Uomo DelleStelle/TheStarmakerbut that was made by Giuseppe Tornatore  a great Italian director as opposed to the mediocre one who made this effort) but awful  rambling script  terrible editing and a director who seemed to have no idea of what he was trying to say  and ended up saying exactly nothing. Apretentious load of rubbish  but the sort of film that certain Italianpseudo-intellectuals whom it was my misfortune to have known in the dim and distant past would have loved it  and unfortunately Italy has no monopoly on these  they can be found everywhere and probably acclaim this as a great masterpiece. I never thought much of Bellochio as director. I remember seeing his first film PugniNella Tasca/Fists in the Pocket (or some such title) in Rome when it was first shown close on 50 years ago (I was living thereat the time). All the usual pseudos raved about it  but it left me pretty cold. I didn't think he was much of a director then  and still don't. Age has certainly not improved him  and this film must rank as one of his worst.,negative
We were excited to rent this one after reading a few reviews and seeing that it scored so highly here. Well  we got it home and could not believe what we saw. Its basically comes off as if its written by some hard up perverted old guy who could not help inserting his sexual frustrations and fantasies into an anime film that really lacks in plot and humor. The main character is all over the place... one moment  he is like an immature little kid  the next moment he is mature and intelligent  then heroic  then a perverted stalker.<br /><br />The worst part is all of the out of place sexual content. I have no problem with sex and dig a movie that has some good sexual energy  but this is just presented in a way that is creepy. Nipple slips  close ups of a girls crotch (many times) in white panties  or a swimsuit. It was totally out of place and it seemed as if the person who wrote it was trying to live out some fantasies through his cartoon characters. <br /><br />We were expecting something of a mature nature  but we just kept looking at each other and asking what the heck the point of this was... besides jiggling cartoon boobs and poor dialogue. If you want to see some cartoon characters cleavage and crotch's... this is for you. If you are looking for something beyond that  this movie was empty. The characters and dialogue were just plain irritating.<br /><br />,negative
On Halloween a town is terrorized by a lunatic with a big pumpkin for a head. Bad acting compromised mostly of local talent and laughable special effects makes this one baaaaad. B-Movie Queen Linnea Quigley looks embarrassed to be a part of this one and even her considerable charm which has helped so many of her other films can't help this one. Pass this cheesy flick if you are looking for a good Halloween horror film and rent Night of the Demons which also stars Ms. Quigley.,negative
I can not believe I even wasted a NetFlix rental on this complete piece of CRAP. How long did it take to make this film? 15 minutes? On a budget of what? Fifteen bucks? I can spend a few hours with my Sony Camcorder and come up with something better than this treacherous lump of bile  and it's even available on DVD!?!! A very sad thing to think classics like The Stepfather have not been released on DVD but this chunk of steaming dung makes it to the format. Here's hoping my rating of ONE ONE ONE ONE makes the overall (already) pathetic rating of 2.5 go DOWN.,negative
Jack-O (1995) was a really bad movie  we are talking snoozefest x 100  no entertainment value whatsoever  no budget  no gore  Z-grade actors etc etc  this film was an awful addition to the horror movie industry and shouldn't have been made!!! The only reason i purchased this movie was because i knew Linnea Quigley was in it  and sure enough  she does her obligatory nude shower scene  which is lovely yes.<br /><br />But as for the film itself........ i fell asleep at the 40 minute stage and had NO desire at all to finish it  it's just bigtime lame OK.<br /><br />I love horror movies  i'm an avid fan  a MASSIVE fan  i love low budget horrors  i love it all  but i hated this rubbish  so i think that will tell you all you need to know about JACK-O.<br /><br />I give this movie 2/10  the 2 is for the 2 minute Linnea shower scene  the movie itself is a total ZERO!!!!,negative
It hurt to watch this movie  it really did... I wanted to like it  even going in. Shot obviously for very little cash  I looked past and told myself to appreciate the inspiration. Unfortunately  although I did appreciate the film on that level  the acting and editing was terrible  and the last 25-30 minutes were severe thumb-twiddling territory. A 95 minute film should not drag. The ratings for this one are good so far  but I fear that the friends and family might have had a say in that one. What was with those transitions? Dear Mr. Editor  did you just purchase your first copy of Adobe Premiere and make it your main goal to use all the goofy transitions that come with that silly program? Anyway... some better actors  a little more passion  and some more appealing editing and this makes a decent movie.,negative
OK  I could only find three reasons to consider this film worthwhile considering the extremely low budget.<br /><br />First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. Actually  the two of them gave me four good reasons to watch  and watch I did.<br /><br />The only other reason to watch is that a lot of was filmed right down the road. Now  I didn't know this beforehand  but I saw an Orange County car tag and said  wow! this was shot in Florida.<br /><br />I was impressed by the flashback to the past and the ancestors of the young kid  but that was really it. The killings by the pumpkin man were pretty lame  with the exception of the biker.<br /><br />If you want to see Quigley and Carter  OK  but Return of the Living Dead will give greater thrills.,negative
Warning Might contain spoilers<br /><br />i just sadly spent 5 bucks on this movie on amazon and i wish i never spent it. I have never seen suck horrible special affects  or acting. I mean Jack-0 is just a laughable monster and his costume looks like something u could buy at a Halloween store or make yourself. The acting is just horrible especially Sean Kelly i mean come on he is so pathetic with his little lines COme get me PUmpkinman low i laughed so hard on this its just stupid. I mean the movie is so awful they had to put a few minutes of nudity in it just for people not to shut it off low. I think the most laughable scene is when the woman sticks a butter knife in the toaster and gets electrocuted. I mean come on that looked so fake and the dummy i could buy that at any Halloween store or make it myself. Well I recommend not watching this cheesy movie cause it will be time you will never get back.,negative
Three delinquents disturb the tomb of an ancient warlock who after summoning Jack-O (a less then menacing pumpkin-headed figure) to dispatch said hoodlums  continues on his sworn vengeance to kill every decedents of the family that offed him. That includes young Sean Kelly and his horror-loving family. Of course it's up to Sean to find a way to save the day.<br /><br />Such a stupid low-budget B-movie. The acting's atrocious and the plot isn't much better. Throw in a extremely lame killer  a possible pedophile who laughs way too much & a couple of stereotypical cardboard cutout 'conservative' couple and you have this film in a nutshell. Not really worth your time save to see how superbly well Linnea is aging. <br /><br />Eye Candy: Linnea Quigley is always good for some T&A and she doesn't disappoint here with a lengthy shower scene; Rachel Carter also gets topless (although it could be a body double)<br /><br />My Grade: D-,negative
My mother and I rented this gem a few years ago while she was here visiting for Thanksgiving. I have rarely laughed so hard. This is a typical low-budget horror movie with dumb special effects  a worse plot  and even worse acting. But are you really expecting a classic when Linnea Quigley receives top billing? I thought not.<br /><br />Since this movie does have some entertainment value  I give it a 3 out of 10.,negative
If you are in search of a masochistic thrill  rent this movie  and show it to a group of your friends sober. This movie is just plane lame  but there not completely without value. The brief tits are nice  and there is one victim's death that is funny as hell. Other than that  this is straight garbage. But it is still better than Grim or Spookies,negative
If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece  this ain't it. If you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good  then this may be for you. There are so many unintentional laughs in this film  that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the opening titles  that say Jack-O  and then add the word Lantern  as if the viewer wasn't able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie. After that  the movie goes in about 20 different directions  none of which make much sense. Jack-o is everywhere  he's in people's houses  in the woods  and yet he doesn't ever seem to do much of anything. He does make a few kills  but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish Jack-o would take out his rage on you the viewer. Other than that  the plot consists of poor acting  gratuitous nudity  and a ridiculous plot line. The acting in this film is among the worst I've ever seen in my 35 plus years of movie-watching. The boy who is the lead in the film (the director's son) has about as much emotion as a corpse  and just about all of the other actors/actresses are just as bad for numerous reasons (especially the bug-eyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers). But  having said all this  if you take this for what it is  (that is a steaming pile of dung) then you will get a few laughs from this movie. What I also found amusing is that the makers of the DVD saw fit to release a 10th Anniversary Version of this movie (as if the original wasn't good enough). And someone actually had the idea of making a behind the scenes mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition (I'm not sure why).......I'll give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10...,negative
I hope this group of film-makers never re-unites.,negative
Wow! What a movie if you want to blow your budget on the title and have it look real bad ask the guys that made this movie on how to do that. They could have spent the money on a good rewrite or something else. Or they could have spent it on beer when they made this movie at least it would have come out better.,negative
"Ugh. Pretty awful.<br /><br />Linnea Quigley gets top billing  but her character doesn't have a big part. Who is her character supposed to be anyway  the little boy's aunt? Another user commented on her getting nude in a shower scene. While there was a shower scene in the movie  it was a head and shoulders shot. Perhaps there are some alternate versions of this movie.<br /><br />Quigley does have a bigger part than John Carradine  Cameron Mitchell  and Brinke Stevens  though. Carradine shows up briefly in a monkish robe reciting vague dialog. No other characters are in the scene with him  though he's sort of composited in  or else there are over-the-shoulder shots unquestionably belonging to someone else. There's also a really bad photo of him in a cameo locket (it looks like a bad photocopy)  and a decent picture of him in a family bible. He conjured up Jack-O originally  or something like that.<br /><br />Cameron Mitchell briefly shows up on a TV as a TV horror host. Brinke Stevens is in the movie he's showing The Coven, in which she runs around a cemetery in a robe. Evidently there's more of the Brinke footage as a bonus feature on the Retromedia DVD double feature Mark of the Witch/The Brides Wore Blood.<br /><br />Jack-O: what's it about? Darn if I know. A little boy is told a story about a pumpkin-headed demon killer  and he and some other kids are scared by a woman they think is a witch for some reason. She follows him home and offers to help his family with their haunted garage for Halloween (put your hand through a hole and feel eyeballs that are actually grapes  etc.). The pumpkin-headed killer shows up several times to hold onto branches while he watches people  or hold his scythe in front of the camera and pose with it for a while. Sometimes he manages to do more than just stand around holding things  and actually kills people.<br /><br />There are also some flashbacks to a western or prairie family  with the little boy playing the little boy in that family too: ancestors of his  I think. I think they figure into Jack-O's backstory  but I'm not sure how.<br /><br />The little boy is ostensibly the main character  but we don't really learn anything about him except that he wears glasses  has nightmares  and will fight bullies even if he'll get beat up in the process. More time should have been spent establishing his character. I couldn't have cared less if he died.<br /><br />Not recommended  not even for Halloween.",negative
This film seems well made  and more efforts should be made to promote films by women. That aside  this film is also profoundly disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is profoundly disturbed. If you've seen any of the promotional material  you might think this is a poignant film about a relationship that's reached its end  but none of that suggests how really disturbing the central premise is:<br /><br />A woman threatens suicide unless her soon to be ex agrees to relive here most treasured memories of their relationship. When told how unfair (to say the least) that such a threat is  Tessa (the purported protagonist) suggests that life's not fair.<br /><br />Huh??? This character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover into staying  and coaxes him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all the while assuring him this isn't sex.<br /><br />Reverse the genders  have the leads played by Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green and this could air in feature length on Lifetime with a title like Hostage to Obsession. There is no medically accepted definition of sound mental and emotional stability that would encompass Tessa's behavior in this film.<br /><br />Props to Kristen Thomson for playing a border-line psychotic  manipulative ex to a T  perhaps too well because there is no well-adjusted person  male or female  who could watch this and not have shivers run up their spine.,negative
In Halloween  three friends seek an ancient cemetery in the suburb for fun and remove a cross from a tomb  where Jack-O was buried many years ago by the farmer Arthur Kelly. The evil creature is unleashed  kills the trio and seeks the descendants of the Kelly family for revenge.<br /><br />The cheesy Jack-O is a combination of a terrible story with awful acting. I was curious with the name of John Carradine in the credits and I can not imagine how a relative authorizes the use of archive footage in such a bad movie  showing a total lack of respect with the name of this great actor. It is impressive how bad the acting is  shifting the film to a comedy instead of the proposed horror genre. This is the type of movie good to see with a group of friends  drinking beer  making comments and laughing a lot. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Jack-O  Demônio do Halloween (Jack-O  Demon of the Halloween),negative
This thing  it shouldn't be called a film  is almost worse than Manos  but you just have to see it it's hilarious. If you see it at video store rent it  if you see the 10th anniversary edition  yes there is a special edition  for under $10 buy it  if your friend has it borrow it  you just have to see this. The acting is so bad  and the gore is is so fake. After viewing this you'll be asking yourself why did they make this insult of the art of film? That's assuming your face doesn't melt off like the Nazis's in Raiders . If you manage to see this  be sure to vote this movie as 1 (awful) so it can make the bottom 100  it really deserves a spot there. I'm surprised it's not number 1  right now.,negative
This is  without a doubt  the most hilarious movie I've ever seen. Seriously  if the makers of this movie are ever discovered  they'll put guys like Jim Carrey out of a job. Rent Jack-O tonight! Believe me  you won't regret it!,negative
When you watch low budget horror movies as much as I do  you get to where you can tell who was involved in creating the movie  as each film-maker adds his own flavor to the cheese. Such is the case with Jack-O. When I watched this truly awful movie  I was left with the undeniable feeling that Fred Olen Ray was involved  maybe not as director but in some fashion  and as I researched  I found that I was correct. Only Fred and a handfull of others could write something this pathetic  and this movie just reeked of Fred Olen Ray. Unless you like Fred Olen Ray (and God only knows why anyone would)avoid this movie. If you're going to rent an Olen Ray pic  rent Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers  it's the only bright shining star in Olen Ray's dark cheesey universe of terrible movies.,negative
I bought Jack-O a number of months ago at a Blockbuster video sale  and at the time I wasn't expecting anything outstanding from it. Upon watching it  I realized I not only got less than I could have ever bargained for  but a whole lot more as well. It seems  strange  I know. And it is. But it's perfectly fitting when you consider that the utter weirdness that is Jack-O<br /><br />The movie follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow  thru ancestral ties  he is marked for death at the hands of a demented  scythe wielding Pumpkin man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's Great-grandfather-uncle-cousin-etc  and now that the villain has been resurrected  Shawn's death is apparently crucial to his hell-bred mission of vengeance. Anyway  much horror ensues as Jack-O hacks his way thru various neighbors before battling Shawn to the finish.<br /><br />I'm not so much here to discuss the plot as I am to determine who may find any worth in this movie. I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the most poorly made movies in the history of time. The acting is deadpan (except when it should be)  the script is apparently a 1st grade group project  and the production budget must not have exceeded $150. Some of the most laughable death scenes are carried out in this anti-thriller  and they're all the more humorous when you realize director Steve Latshaw actually seems serious in his movie-making.<br /><br />And yet I heartily enjoyed the film. I can call it a terrible horror movie  yes. But I can also say I had a great time watching it with my friends  and have watched it several times since that fateful first viewing. Many people (including some of my friends) will find this movie intolerable and needlessly time-consuming  and that's understandable. If you're like me and enjoy ridiculously bad horror movies that take themselves seriously  you'll find Jack-O an instant classic  which is also understandable.<br /><br />That's why it's so hard to rate this movie. If I were rating Jack-O's quality as a film  I wouldn't give it anything. In fact  the studio would owe me stars. Yet if I were rating it's on the basis of pure enjoyment  I'd give it an 8 or a 9. I'll give it a 4  so to be somewhere in the middle. I recommend everyone go out  rent this  and form their own conclusion.,negative
"I've always loved horror flicks. From some of the usual well-known like The Exorcist to some of the more underrated like Black Christmas or Just Before Dawn. But who are people kidding even calling this trash a b-movie. It's straight up bottom-of-the-barrel Z-grade. The acting is the worst ever on film. Really I've seen better on an episode of the Young and the Restless...SPOILER...Lookout for when the woman comes to tell them about the legend of Jack-o. She pauses sometimes for a matter of seconds as if someone is flashing her cue cards and she's struggling to read her lines. A RIOT! <br /><br />Oh and besides the bad acting absolutely no gore or F/X. And Jack-o looked like a plastic lit pumpkin. Watch Linnea Quigley in Night of the Demons or Silent Night,Deadly Night far superior flicks.",negative
Man  this movies sucked. It appeared to have like seven different plots going on at once and they all made little to no sense. The special effects  costumes  and all that stuff were beyond awful. The acting was particullary bad. Everything seemed so forced  especially the lines from the woman with the huge eyes and the little kid (his Noooooo as he gets burried is so unenthusiastic it's laughable). A good portion of this movie is rather funny anyway. The one woman's death where she shoves a knife into a toaster  gets electrocuted  and magically turns into the crapiest skeleton dummy in the world had my friends and I laughing for a good ten minutes.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're into watching really horrible movies  seek this one out. If not  run for your life.,negative
I bought this out of curiosity. How did John Carradine (who died in 1988) and Cameron Mitchell (who died in 1994) make appearances in a film made in 1995? Thanks to the miracle of unused film can footage that's probably been sitting on a shelf somewhere for ten years  that's how! You can tell because the film stock used to shoot their scenes doesn't match the film used for shooting Jack-O. The curse of Ed Wood lives on. The good thing for both Carradine and Mitchell is that this is exactly the kind of movie you'd expect to find on both of their filmographies. Same goes for Scream Queens Linnea Quigley  Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith.<br /><br />The setting is Oakmoor Crossing on Halloween  and some kind of curse is released when dumb  beer-guzzling teens disrupt a grave. The result: a hulking killer with a scythe and a big plastic pumpkin on his head! He (it?) goes after the wholesome Kelly family for revenge (and kills others who get in his way). The father opens a Haunted Garage for the neighborhood kiddies. The son (Ryan Latshaw  son of the director) has one continuous  perplexed facial expression for all his scenes and one hilariously badly acted dramatic scene lying in a grave. At least he's a kid. The mother's eyes about pop out of her head while she strains to read her dialogue. There is also an annoying woman who shows up to explain things who seems to be trying to phonetically pronounce all of her dialogue.<br /><br />So what about the name actors? You see Stevens  Wildsmith and Mitchell briefly on a TV screen (they're used to pad out the time). Linnea has a bigger role as a babysitter  and she does exactly what she can with it. Her enthusiastic performance helps a little bit. There's also one out-of-nowhere laugh when an ultra-conservative couple who watch a Rush Limbaugh clone on TV bite it. The woman slips on a rug and stabs a toaster with a knife. She's electrocuted and the end result looks like a flame-broiled Muppet.<br /><br />All and all  pretty entertaining stuff! I wasn't bored!,negative
I had known Brad Linaweaver at Florida State U in the early 70's when he was an inspiring  inventive writer who I thought was headed for greater glory.<br /><br />And that is why I rented this video. Well  well  well  the time has not been kind to Mr Linaweaver. I suppose the pressures of making a living makes higher aspirations expendable. Another flower whose bloom has come and gone un-noticed in the summer breeze. Amen. There is nothing more to say. And nothing more to add. A sad epitaph to a once blossoming career as stated above. But it is the price one pays for chasing shadows without a firm foundation or goals for oneself in life. Because this movie has no goal  no purpose  and I kept telling myself  what happened to Brad's creativity  his once shining genius? Gone  gone  years of neglect has deteriorated his once shining mind.,negative
I felt compelled to write a review after seeing the only review which gave this film a suspiciously high 9/10 rating. I say suspicious because it looks less like a review but more like a publicity statement. Perhaps the filmmaker himself  or one of his mates  has written that review? Naughty  naughty.<br /><br />I watched this movie on the Propeller channel on Sky TV expecting it to be truly awful. The special effects used were to be honest very  very good for a low budget film  and some of the acting wasn't that bad either  but most of the acting was really awful  but well done for trying  as I expect most were pals of the filmmaker.<br /><br />I think the filmmaker has done really well by trying to punch above his weight. I did find some of the film funny because it was trying to be super cool when it just wasn't.<br /><br />If you don't take this film too seriously and watch it whilst drunk with some mates you might well have a good time but probably not in the way it was intended. This film is no way a 9/10 but worth watching for a laugh bearing in mind it was made on a very very low budget and in fairness due credit to those involved in it's production.,negative
Sorry  but Jacqueline Hyde (get it??? - Jack L and Hyde - Jekyll & Hyde) has some of the worst acting this side of hardcore porn  not to mention a script apparently written by a first-grader with undiagnosed learning disabilities.<br /><br />Jackie Hyde inherits an old mansion by a grandfather she never knew she had. Guess who? Yes  an inventor of the special formula that slowly takes over one's body and mind - yes  that Mr. Hyde! <br /><br />Despite some nice skin scenes  this film fails to register any feeling or emotion other than uncontrollable laughter.<br /><br />As much as poor Jackie tries she just can't stay away from granddaddy's special formula and the result is an hour and half of wasted time.,negative
I really did not want to write a harsh review of this movie because I genuinely appreciate how hard it is to make any kind of movie on an incredibly low budget  let alone attempt something as ambitious as a sci-fi.<br /><br />However this movie is truly awful. The acting is among some of the worst I have ever had to endure and as a fan of low budget movies that is a pretty serious accusation to make. There are plenty of aspiring actors out there who would work on a deferred payment scheme if they believed in the movie and what the director was trying to achieve. I'm sure the actors did their best as did everybody else involved in this production  but it simply was not good enough to pull off something of this magnitude.<br /><br />Then there is the dialogue. Very poor indeed. There is no excuse for that. I got the impression the script was hastily written on the back of a beer mat after some epic boozing session. I hesitate to use the word 'laughable' but that's exactly what the script is. I had no empathy with any of the characters. Indeed they grated on me with the result that on more than one occasion I wanted to thump a couple of them Mr Stirton has overstretched himself by taking on too many roles. Clint Eastwood he is not. Again  there are talented people out there willing to work on deferment if they believe in the project.<br /><br />Much has been made of the special effects in this movie. For the money  they are exceptional  if somewhat overused. It is like someone said I have after effects and boy am I gonna use it. Whoever did the CG work was among the most talented of this crew.<br /><br />Quite simply the money was not available to make as ambitious a movie as this attempts to be. Kudos for attempting it  but unfortunately it fails to reach its heady goals in far too many ways.<br /><br />I salute everyone involved with its production  I really do  but for their next effort they either need to get a better producer or lower their sights to something more manageable.<br /><br />In conclusion I cannot recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic of film students or habitual insomniacs. If you want to watch a true masterpiece of low budget sci-fi films try the student made Dark Star by a certain Mr John Carpenter.,negative
I went through great efforts to get this movie after reading the comments on this site. I really don't have time to write reviews but I felt this was my duty as a sci-fi horror buff. This is only the second review I have written. The other was for Dracula 3000. Now to the point. This movie sucked. Plain and simple. I kept wondering if I was watching the same movie as those who wrote all those lovely comments. I have seen movies with bad effects  bad acting  bad sound  you name it and I've seen it. But this really sucked. I don't care how much it costs or didn't cost to make  movies like this and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the whole cast and crew arrested and jailed for time murder. By the way  Did I mention that this movie sucked. I mean really sucked. The plot was non exist and the acting was weak. It seems like the writer saw Pitch Black and got upset because he didn't think of a plot like that first so he decided to make his own ripped off version. But instead  the suck factor took over and possessed him. DON'T WATCH THIS. You'll have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on burning coals.,negative
"I pride myself in being able to sit through everything. I think if I've paid the rental fee, then I'm going to at least watch it. I have found the exception to this rule- The Planet. I don't know what the exchange rate is  but reading through the other comments I can only guess that £8000 must be around $150. I'll date myself but this movie reminds me of the old Steve Reeves movies of the 50's. He was a bodybuilder turned actor. He was in these really awful Italian  dubbed movies that starred Reeves as Hercules or some other muscle bound hero. As a kid watching them you couldn't quite articulate why these movies stunk- you just knew they did. Mike Mitchell IS the new Steve Reeves. That's it.. that's what this really was- a new telling of an old Italian Spaghetti Sand and Sandals movie. And  I kid you not- where was Reeves born? Glasgow  Montana. This movie isn't so bad that it's kind of fun to watch- it's just plain bad.",negative
This movie was awful  plain and simple! The animation scenes had absolutely terrible graphics. It was VERY clear to see that this film had about the budget of my grocery bill!! The acting was just as bad.. I've seen better acting in pornographic films. I would seriously like the hour and twenty minutes of my life back. In fact  I registered on IMDb just so that other people don't get sucked into watching this like I did. Don't get me wrong though  I love sci-fi films! This one seemed more like the intro to a video game :( I'm glad I only spent a dollar to see this one! The story line reminded me of the movie pitch black  A prisoner on a ship in outer space escapes. Oh my goodness.. what are we gonna do??? I would not even let this play in the background of my house while I was cleaning! Bottom line here  you can do better.,negative
I've got 10 plus year old computer games with better special effects! Plot is choppy and very predictable. Most of the actors seem like extras with no experience! Everyone has Scottish accents. It's like watching a crew of 'Scotties' from Star Trek without the personality or charm. Needless scenes of people putting up tents! Tents with all of the supposedly high tech equipment! Actors looking like they were not sure the camera was on them. Nothing to make you care if these people survive or not! Looks like it was made in someone's backyard and garage using low end equipment! Nothing seems original or even slightly entertaining. Do not waste your time!,negative
I really didn't like this film~!!!! it was boring and didn't interest me that much at all.. i'm more of an action girl  and it had NONE. i went and rented this movie because of the other comment that was left.. but was totally mislead! don't get this movie unless you like the dessert and plenty of boredom. i just really didn't like the movie. it wasn't my style  but it could be yours.. you would just have to watch the previews or something but it's my recommendation if you're a girl.. don't get this movie! This Scandinavian production draws on some of the observational strategies of Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi  allowing us to reflect on patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and sweeping viewpoints. this just isn't for me!,negative
Even with it's low budget this movie could have been worth watching if there was a story to tell here. It started out pretty good  and fairly engaging and believable. The actors and characters were interesting although there wasn't much character development. My favorite scene was when they were all eating their rations. Some seemed to hate it  and some seemed to think it wasn't too bad. The story starts out very airtight. And then... <br /><br />And then it dipped into a little horror which is usually a death sentence for most sci fi. Suddenly no scientific basis for any of the goings on. No real believable end game for the villain? No real explanation of what's going on. Generally if a movie has to use the F word for every other word it usually spirals down from there too. I still get offended believe it or not. I often wonder what inspires people to make bad sci fi? Isn't there a universe of fantastically good stories out there? Don't people feel like they are wasting their time and everyone else's when they put out stuff like this. Why do we get so much mediocre sci fi like this? No female actors/characters either? None at all? This had the makings to be another Predator but alas fell far far short. <br /><br />My final comment - poor editing and finally too low a budget to build a real campfire? What gives? <br /><br />My advice for any low budget sci fi movie production companies out there. Make sure you got a good story before you start  and edit out bad special effects - it's better we see nothing than something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy.,negative
Going to need to take a deep breath for this one...<br /><br />Terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget. Blatant and unashamed plagiarism of other sci-fi movies (like Pitch Black). Terrible acting. Endless slow motion scenes of characters walking aimlessly across sand dunes. Meandering dialogue that does nothing to further the story. Characters wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns. A cargo ship staffed by a camouflage-wearing crew of gun-toting soldiers (why exactly would you need forest-camouflage in space anyway?). Some of the worst casting choices in the history of no-budget film-making - a steroid swollen captain who comes across more like a muscle-beach jock than a trustworthy commander  and a convict who looks and acts about as dangerous as a bunny rabbit. 70 minutes in length  35 of which could have been trimmed out if the director had any concept of compression of time through editing...<br /><br />I won't go on. Suffice it to say that while some components of this awful movie can (and should) be forgiven due to it's low budget; the bad conception  laughable plot holes  and snore-inducing script are unforgivable on *any* budget. The end result is a tedious  dull  waste of time. Sorry guys  I hate to be so harsh on an amateur film  but you've no excuse for turning out this kind of work.,negative
Jacqueline Hyde starts like any other normal day for telemarketing individual Jackie Hyde (co-producer Gabriella Hall) until her boss (Robert Donovan) fires her for taking personal calls at work  however it's not all bad news as the call she took was from a lawyer informing her that her Grandfather (Malcolm Bennett) has recently died & that he left her his mansion & fortune (why doesn't stuff like that ever happen to me? Sigh). Very excited Jackie heads on over there & makes herself right at home  while looking for the thermostat late one night Jackie stumbles upon a secret room where her Grandfather stashes the bright red formula that he invented that allows whoever drinks it to change their appearance. Being a bit on the porky side Jackie finally settles on the glamorous Jacqueline (Blythe Metz)  however Jackie's better looking alter-ego starts to take control...<br /><br />Written  co-produced & directed by Rolfe Kanefsky I thought Jacqueline Hyde was complete total & utter crap from start to finish & it's as simple & straight forward as that. According to the opening credits Jacqueline Hyde was 'inspired' by the classic Robert Louis Stevenson novel 'The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'  frankly if Mr. Stevenson could see what was being done to his story here he'd turn in his grave. For a start I think Jacqueline Hyde was/is intended to be a horror film  the IMDb certainly lists it as such but there isn't any horror in it at all apart from just how bad it is. I would say that Jacqueline Hyde is more a soft-core porno than anything else & extremely tame with it  why sit down & watch this softer than soft porno crap when you can watch you proper hard-core stuff that actually delivers the goods? Why  that's the question I ask here. It's not even good porn either  besides being far too soft it's dull  boring & the not-worth-mentioning sex scenes are few & far between. The most intelligent aspect of this film is the title which would have been quite clever if not for the fact that another film used the Jacqueline Hyde (1998) title during the last century & judging by the IMDb's plot summary it sounds a hell of a lot better than this piece of rubbish. This is one of those films you have to watch yourself to see just how bad it is but just hope that you never get the opportunity.<br /><br />Director Kanefsky was obviously working on a low budget but that's not an excuse these days  shot on a digital camcorder the film looks cheap & the few instances of CGI look like they came from a Nintendo Gameboy  the final 'shocking' twist has probably the worst morph effect I've ever seen & is pretty good for a laugh as is the scene when Jackie's breasts grow via more terrible CGI. That's another thing  the film takes itself far too seriously. The subject matter sucks  is far too predictable & makes for a poor film but maybe if the dialogue had been intentionally funny with some dirty porn talk the film might have been more fun to watch  alas it isn't so it isn't. Forget about any decent horror  violence or gore as there isn't any apart from a surprisingly bloodless decapitation at the end.<br /><br />Technically Jacqueline Hyde is home made film type stuff  the photography is of the flat hand held point-&-shoot variety  the music  production design & special effects are of a suitably low standard to match the script. The acting was awful  seriously this is bad.<br /><br />Jacqueline Hyde in my opinion a load of crap  there is not one positive thing about this turgid film that I can think of. Any proper film lover will have an almost impossible time trying to find any redeeming value in this crap  definitely one to avoid.,negative
I was excited about this movie after reading other reviews. What a disappointment! There are so many ways that this movie is bad. The computer graphics were lacking to say the least. I found the acting stiff and unbelievable. Watch the sand as the lost e-pods (what an original name!)are found. Where did all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized portions similar to other movies  ie Alien  Pitch Black. Come on one huge ship to transport one prisoner? And what is with the prisoner? Does he speak  can he speak? I kept waiting for something to tie the bits of the story together  but it never came. If this movie was made on a low budget  it shows. The only part of the movie I liked was when it finally ended. I don't mean that I liked the ending  I didn't. I just liked the fact that it was over. A trip to the dentist would have been more enjoyable. In my opinion. don't waste your time on this one.,negative
It is OK movie if it would be done by high school kids for their friends. It is way below limits be called professional. There isn't plot  no actors' play and visual looks like you see it through the plastic film. I was so glad that I have FF button on my remote  32x worked really well. I understand that everyone need to start somewhere  but it shouldn't be reason to bring it to the public. If you have concerns about quality and budget - Open water was made on $60000 and more than half went to the guy who provided the security in the ocean and trained sharks. And that movie looks 100 times more professional and it was an event in the indy film-making.,negative
This movie is proof you can't just go to a Redbox and read descriptions of films and pick one and give it a try.<br /><br />While I'll give 'em great credit for having produced a film with halfway-decent special effects on such a low budget  and at least a halfway decent script and story line... unfortunately  it was only just that: halfway decent.<br /><br />If you like movies where things aren't all neatly wrapped up  and don't mind low-budget effects  you might like this film. Honestly  it wasn't really my cup of tea. I should've just gone to bed rather than spend my time watching.<br /><br />For a better science-fiction movie produced on an even LOWER budget (!) have a look at Primer.,negative
I think its safe to say that if you only really watch box office standard films or any premium production don't bother with this film as you will hate it. If you are an overly critical film buff don't bother either. If you love science fiction films and don't care what capacity you get a glimpse of the future in then you'll be mildly entertained. It is very obvious that the budget for this was super super low but what they have done with the money is worth a pat on the back. Some of the burning fire scenes were pretty bad and the evacuation scenes were terrible but it is quite obvious that they had some good support from a computer perspective as the planet scenes and the alien images were quite inventive. The dialog is down right hilarious but acting not altogether poor. As for the story well  I'm not too sure what actually happened at all to tell you the truth.,negative
I think that you can not imagine how these people really work...!! Before I came to the studios to watch the guys work there  I actually thought quite the same as you do. But since I saw and did the work the guys on that TV-show have to do  I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long. That really is no easy work. And also the actors  which in your eyes may be terribly bad  are really great people and a lot of them really can act! I don't think that the material given to them can really show that  as I think this material isn't very good. But THEY are truly good! So I don't think that you  before you haven't seen these guys doing there work  can judge over them! And I shouldn't have judged over them as well before I met them  but I did and am now terribly ashamed of it. So please  do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven't seen them doing there job.,negative
I watched this movie only because I was under the impression that I was going to be treated to a cheesy horror flick. I mean  look at the tag line: They're men turned inside out! And worse... they're still alive! Does that not scream cheesy horror movie to you? And the then there's the title itself-- Screamers. What a perfectly apt title for a horror movie  I thought! Unfortunately  I wasn't aware that the real title was  properly translated  The Island of the Fishmen.<br /><br />So  about an hour into watching this I realized that this was not a cheesy horror movie at all-- it was a cheesy adventure story about slimy fish-men from Atlantis. Men turned inside out? No. There was nothing of the sort. I was grossly disappointed.<br /><br />Damn you  misleading taglines! I want those 81 minutes of my life back!,negative
OK by the time you read this I MIGHT have stopped crying. This movie was so horrible as to be quite vexing. The creatures are kinda cute  but the only really good thing about the movie was the growing attachment among the prisoners and their guard after getting marooned on this daffy island. Even seeing Barbara Bach with her hair all riffled was no payoff for buying this sterling bit of poop. She goes about with a whispery I've-never-used-my-voice-before breathiness that just don't wash when one is screaming bloody murder. (Hey the leading man was cute too but I'm still not assuaged.) This is a cry-into-your-beer ripoff of the good ole Island of Dr. Moreau. Poor Richard Johnson  who was surely born for better things  is just unrelievedly bad as the bad guy. I mean  HOW bad can a BAD guy BE? (Ask Richard Johnson). Joseph Cotten tries hard not to look embarrassed as he staggers through his cameo appearance. In the name of all that's holy  don't rent this darned bomb.,negative
Yes  the video cover of this movie made me want to watch this film as a child. It was called Screamers on this particular cover with the tagline Men turned inside out!. It even featured this warped looking skeleton on the cover as well that made all sorts of cool gory images run through my mind. Perhaps some sort of movie about some strange virus that caused a person's flesh to burn off  maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody looking than what you usually get  a science experiment gone incredibly wrong and now strange men with the flesh dripping off their bones go on the rampage. Yes  all these thoughts ran through my mind  one that did not was fish guys on some island with virtually no gore and all bore. This movie is really more like the Island of Dr. Moreau than anything else and quite frankly that movie bored me too  it is way to much scientist and not enough killing for my tastes. These films are to much figure stuff out and not enough blood for my tastes. Yes I know  I have strange tastes  but I can not help it  I like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving and exciting this movie is really neither.,negative
Wow  another Kevin Costner hero movie. Postman  Tin Cup  Waterworld  Bodyguard  Wyatt Earp  Robin Hood  even that baseball movie. Seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention. The characters are almost always the same ... the heroics  the flaws  the greatness  the fall  the redemption. Yup  within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie  we're all supposed to be in awe of his character  and it builds up more and more from there.<br /><br />And this time the story ... story? ... is just a collage of different movies. You don't need a spoiler; you've seen this movie several times  though it had different titles. You'll know what will happen way before it happens. This is like mixing An Officer and a Gentleman with Backdraft  but both are easily better movies. Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made ... and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor  Russell  plays the hero.,negative
It's exactly what the title tells you...an island inhabited by fishmen. Shipwrecked doctor Claudio Cassinelli and crew land on the island  they're either picked off by the fishmen or roped into working for treasure hunting lunatic Richard Johnson. Cassinelli discovers that Johnson  who believes he's found the lost city of Atlantis  has been keeping disgraced scientist Joseph Cotten and his daughter Barbara Bach hostage for 15 years so the fishmen can uncover a treasure trove beneath the sea. Cotten  of course  is a complete madman. Bach and Cassinelli have great chemistry. This insanity was directed by Sergio Martino and is not  surprisingly  without merit. It's fast paced  reasonably well acted and the fishmen look pretty convincing (though it's unlikely anyone could prove that these things DON'T look like actual fishmen). There's an excellent music score by Luciano Michelini.,negative
"I saw this movie as part of a Billy Graham program. The church I attend was part of a community wide outreach to present God and Christianity to our community (Hartford  Ct. USA). I was one of the counselors who helped attendees (who were invited to come forward and make whatever kind of religious profession they wanted...and to follow up on them after the movie. As such  it did what it was supposed to do  and I personally found it to be a medium to strengthen my faith in God.I also found it to be very helpful to those I counseled. I especially like the work of Kim Darby in this movie. And the parents (the Wintons?) were   in a way  a little overdrawn....no one says to their child if they think that he or she may be the parent of an illegitimate child something like the Wintons did oh, no, no, not thaaat. That isn't exactly what they said  but the sympaathetic audience I saw had a laugh at whatever it was they did say  and also at the son's emphatic No, MOm, not me. Don Berghuis",negative
Maniratnam  who in India  is often compared with prominent world film makers and is regarded a genius in film-making  has yet again proved that he can only make the frames look visually good  without offering much food for thought.Forget about pure cinematic pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art.<br /><br />While I would not like to claim and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world  still any thoughtful and a bit educated film goer can identify that his films do not contain innovative ingenuous plots  does not contain lingering effects afterward and MOSTLY contain ridiculous ending and a LOT of melodrama  seen profusely in Indian movies.<br /><br />Overall  Maniratnam has successfully confirmed my distaste for his films once again.<br /><br />Sorry for those who on this board were claiming otherwise. My suggestion to you: WATCH SOME BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE AROUND THE GLOBE.,negative
This version is very painful to watch. All of the acting is very stilted but especially that of Norma Shearer who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie. Check out the 1937 version with Joan Crawford  Robert Montgomery and William Powell which is much more entertaining.,negative
"I found this early talkie difficult to watch and I'm a Norma Shearer fan! It's not her fault  but the primitive production values of this film would cause any viewer to become bored. 90% of the movie is filmed with medium shots, and it's very similar to watching a dull play.",negative
You'd hardly know that a year later MGM put Norma Shearer in THE DIVORCEE which glows with MGM technical know how. How far they came in one year. CHENEY is a very stagey early talkie. The camera hardly moves. Shearer is her usual charming self and Rathbone does well in a romantic leading role. They are all very careful to speak clearly and slowly into the microphone source which does mitigate against a naturally flowing dramatic scene  but the play is a sturdy and fun warhorse so one can enjoy oneself if one's expectations are not too high. Oh  by the way  the plot involves a ring of upper class jewel thieves who infiltrate themselves into society to prey on their victims. There are some clever twists in the script and true love conquers all. An Oscar nom for Best Screenplay Adaptation.,negative
As a physicist  talk about blackholes and cosmology gets my heart racing. However I found this presentation too slow and not packed with enough information for the interested layman (who is most likely to see it). If you have more than a passing curiosity in this sort of stuff  go to the library and check out some books. You will find they explain current scientific cosmologies with far more detail while at the same time filling you with more of a sense of wonder than this movie does. Also to set the record straight: Hawking is NOT considered the greatest mind or the world's smartest person as commonly asserted even among the user reviews here at the IMDb. Hawking himself has commented that It is rubbish. It is just media hype. They needed somebody to fill the role model of disabled genius. At least I'm disabled. To be fair  he is probably a genius but among history's greatest scientists  people like Einstein  Newton  Gauss  and many others easily are even more highly regarded. This is not to disrespect Hawking who is a undoubtedly a great scientist but rather not to disrespect others who have done even more than he has. Anyhow  see the movie if you are truly into science. But if not  I think it would be boring for you.,negative
Clifton Webb is one of my favorites. However  Mister Scoutmaster is not one of his best. His patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny. The film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality. In addition  the viewer is presented with numerous ham-handed references to religious faith and U.S. patriotism that come off as over-reverent rather than genuine. Clifton Webb does his best with a poor script. Edmund Gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do. The child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film. His sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog-like low voice unusual for someone of his age. However  once you've heard it  you've heard it and you don't need to hear it again. Unfortunately  he is in the majority of the film's scenes. I find this child so irritating that I fast forward whenever he shows up. Since he has a lot of scenes in this film  this means that I fast forward through a lot of the film. There were and are so many talented child actors; it's a pity this film doesn't have any of them in it. Still  Clifton Webb in the traditional broad-brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing.,negative
I just watched this movie on Bravo! and it was absolutely horrible. It has the plot of a Shannon Tweed movie without the nudity. The premise was interesting enough  a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want the money. The characters were trite as were the observations on human nature and greed.<br /><br />For a movie called Class Warfare it had very little to do with class differences other than the first 20 minutes and the predictable ending. This movie could have done a lot better if there had been more characters with motivations to get the ticket and was a who done it?<br /><br />The acting wasn't fantastic but it's hard to seem believable with such a terrible script. Lindsey McKeon is very cute and I'd like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script. She's probably the only reason why I sat through the whole movie.<br /><br />,negative
Despite the fact that this was a Made-For-TV movie (and an obvious one at that: ie.  cheap looking)  CLASS WARFARE left me wishing I could get my money back  and considering this lame production was partially funded through Canadian dollars  I might just be entitled.<br /><br />What made me sit through it in the first place was seeing actress Lindsey McKeon  who I've watched for the last couple years in her role as goody-goody Mara Lewis on the soap-opera GUIDING LIGHT  taking a turn at playing the bad girl for a change. <br /><br />Surprisingly she does quite well  as Kristen  a spoiled rich-b*tch who suddenly finds herself dirt-poor  but with a conniving streak  and a twist of fate  that will possibly change her fortunes back around. The twist of fate is provided in the character of Richard (Robin Dunne)  a socially-radical outcast who discovers that he has just gone from having nothing to winning $23 million on a lottery ticket. Now  put Richard  Kristen  her jock-boyfriend Jason (Wade Carpenter)  and their camcorder-obsessed mutual buddy Graham (Dave McGowan) together for the weekend in a remote cabin  cut off from the world by storms  and just guess what unfolds.<br /><br />The film suffers from congesting both the story and characters'personas and motives too much. Everyone is pretty one-dimensional and it doesn't take a rocket-scientist to figure out that some things  and some people  are going to go very bad  very quickly. I don't think this is that original a plot and it doesn't go out of it's way to make itself anything more. The acting is OK  McKeon is spot-on as the manipulative female lead  and Dunne is very good  perhaps a little too good at times  but no one else is worth writing home about. The only other real credit I can give the film is the one twist I didn't see coming towards the end (not the very end though  that one is so obvious it hurts). Regardless  I sat through all of it and lived to tell the tale so I can't say it was a complete write-off. <br /><br />4/10. A something-to-watch-when-nothing-else-is-on type movie.,negative
"The Man with the Golden Arm (the movie) is a decent career vehicle for Frank Sinatra  but fails abysmally as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You always hear about how books are changed when they are made into films- things are cut out  dumbed down  etc. Well  you can't even say they changed anything with the movie- they just told a completely different story. The characters and setting are the same sure- but not the ambiguous characterization  the depth of the men and women of Polish Chicago in the book. As for the setting  it's become merely a play stage  complete with the unnecessary supporting role players walking all too busilly down the claustrophobic  interior exterior streets. The movie is a dumbed-down  completely different take on Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When this happens  Zosh  Frankie  Sparrow  all lose their psychological edge. Frankie's drumming  a modest dream in the book  becomes his full passion in the movie (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is treated as shlock  exploitavely. The acting is decent  especially the snakelike Louie  who is more menacing in the movie than the book. But it's just a shame this kind of movie can be heralded as a classic alongside the book it is based upon, the real story of Frankie Machine. The movie just goes to show Hollywood can' get anything right without dumbing it down and adding a happy ending. In this case  they just changed it completely  cheapening an important and realistic story into Hollywood fluff. I'm sure as hell biased because I read the book first  so I can't really treat the movie honestly by knowing how good the book is. I actually thought about turning the movie off (and I never do that)  just so I wouldn't get its silly plot confused with the beauty of the book. But this is an overrated film  and while it's not so bad  the book should come first  as it was the first. And it should have remained the only story of Division Street and Frankie Machine.",negative
This is the story of a maniac cop who  for some reason  has it in for a young college stud and his mates. After they report him to his supervisor who in turns suspends him pending psychiatric evaluation  he finds an opportunity to psychology torture them when  on a bet  the kids hack into a department store's security and unlock the door. Only  they get locked in the store  along with the weirdo. Murder and mayhem are afoot  and the kids are running around trying to survive until morning when they may be able to escape.<br /><br />'Dangerous Game' would have been a successful cat-and-mouse psycho thriller probably if it was set in a different location. The thought of psychotic cop chasing around a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn't work. Especially when he comes face-to-face with his flinching prey quite frequently and yet  does nothing serious quite often. There was no real confrontation as would be sufficient for this kind of story  and may've worked better if say  for example  the teens were loose in the neighborhood and left to fend for themselves against this weirdo (especially if that took a few days while he makes them increasingly paranoid...although granted  even that is clichéd).<br /><br />What a shame  too  that it could not have been a better thriller  considering a funky cast of young Australian characters. Even a light hearted adventure despite the madness of the villain interspersed through the picture might have even made it a more satisfying picture. Instead  it started out fresh  and sure did have plenty of action sequences  but wound up verging on the ridiculous.,negative
I have NEVER fallen asleep whilst watching a movie before.<br /><br />I did with this one.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs  give your time and money to a worthy cause instead.,negative
If B movies  tired and corny scripts  and golf carts dressed up as some sort of futuristic mode of transport are your sort of entertainment  you'll probably enjoy this. Otherwise  forget it. The topless newsreader  though completely irrelevant  did give a few seconds of amusement.,negative
Planet Earth has suffered a terrible environmental disaster so humanity now survives underground split in to different religious cults . What caused the catastrophe ? I have no idea ? why is humanity split in to different ecclesiastical factions ? I have no idea . Since the surface of the Earth can no longer support human life how are the humans able to grow crops in order to feed the population ? I have no idea . What sort of producer thought this screenplay deserved to receive funding ? I have no idea <br /><br />SHEPHERD is one of these films that creeps up late at night on cable channels . The sort of film where you consult the IMBb to see if it has any merits . The number of people who've commentated on SHEPHERD on this page hasn't yet reached double figures and this is a film that was released nine years ago . Perhaps the people who have never seen it are the lucky ones ? <br /><br />As for the rest of the plot it's very routine . Grumpy former cop Boris Dakota whose wife and child died several years previously meets a woman and her child and it's up to him to save their lives   almost like a futuristic western . Throw in a former wrestler who now runs the God channel   a fascist Christian bloke who's trying to snuff out Boris   a ventriloquist   some T&A for the sake of it and you've got a mess of a film . I guess after seeing this Neil Marshall's DOOMSDAY is possibly a masterwork of cinema in comparison,negative
This film  which I rented under the title Black Voodoo should be avoided. I was expecting a blaxploitation/horror flick; but what I got was a very dull  standard ghost extracts vegence. In this case the ghost was that of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment  but who's plea was ignored and he died in an operation. The result: his spirit posesses Nurse Sherry and forces her to commit acts of murder. The only voodoo connection was to one of the three black characters  in this case a blinded ex-football player  who's mom practiced voodoo. The film is very slow and very dull. There is a very standard ending that provides on excitement  followed by a horrificly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER)<br /><br />In which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she was possessed. This movie is slow  and bad in a non-funny  just stupefying way. Avoid it at all costs.,negative
First of all  let me start by saying that I have been a devoted follower of C Thomas Howell's career ever since The Outsiders and The Hitcher. He was an up and coming star in the 1980s - with hits such as Soul Man also. The future was bright for this young actor and he had the potential to go on from there and really assert himself in Hollywood. Put it this way - Tom Cruise had a bit part in The Outsiders while Howell had the lead. Look at Cruise today !!! But picking material like this drivel will only denigrate Howell's career even more - if that was possible. Why does he pick stuff like this? A small part in a major movie would be of more benefit to him than this rubbish.<br /><br />Essentially the story here takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where everybody lives underground where chaos reigns. Howell is a Shepherd - protecting the flock of various religious leaders by killing off any undesirables. He's a hit-man in other words.<br /><br />The sets are so bad  they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode. The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here)  no continuity  scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever  vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity. Oh yeah  and the storyline was pathetic too.<br /><br />I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it. I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.<br /><br />In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film. It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell. Come on C - give yourself some credit and wrestle yourself away from these non-hit wonders and try to knuckle down and get a good part - however small.<br /><br />1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.,negative
I say flick because this doesn't deserve the appellation movie  and certainly not film. I regret paying for the rental  and although I've never walked out on a movie before  this would have been it  had I seen it in a theatre. A society living underground in the future (oooh  THAT'S original)  lots of burning barrel drums  unexplained ambient light shining through windows  an ungrateful woman and her shock-muted son...the list goes on and on. C. Thomas Howell affects the husky voice of the stereotypical loner; you know like Eastwood's been done to death. He needs special sunglasses to remember his wife and child  yet in the flashbacks  he's the same age! Talk about a poor memory! I stared incredulously when the little boy Abe randomly pushes a code into a door and it opens! No tension  pithy religious (what religion?) under/overtones...saddest of all: I expected better from Roddy Piper;<br /><br />Quite possibly the worst movie experience in my life.,negative
Okay now this movie is a piece of work. It's full of stupid jesus refrences and dialougue that would render most human biengs to question whether or not they should be wattching movies at all. Big names like Roddy Piper  and David Carradine draw you in but  take it from me  this movie sucks. The story is incomprehensible  and lacking completley in intellegence. The sets  veihicles  and costumes come of as a cross beetween bablon five  and a bondage flick. I'm sure theres porn with better dialougue.,negative
"I am so disappointed. After waiting for 3 years for repeats/the DVD of the original masterpiece series Darkplace i couldn't wait for this series. The first episode just ended and I am appalled. Everything that was great about Darkplace has been erased here  pretty much. Worst introduction: canned laughter. this takes the original point of it away and just renders it nearly unwatchable. (one joke about Garth's eyes fertilizing the audience was good... the rest i can hardly remember...) it feels like a poor quality Knowing Me, Knowing You. I hope this improves as the series goes on  otherwise i shall be seriously disappointed. back to Darkplace...<br /><br />You are the most compassionate man I ever known. And i know God...",negative
Some spoilers**** A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful  low key  truly erotic scene. I also loved the music score and the soft  muted cinematography. I'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying). My biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life. Of course  she has to be shown as a sexworker (what else)  scatterbrained  impractical  absurdly frilly/girly  completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world. Moreover  she's always shown with two days growth of beard (for some bizarre reason) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is. And she's waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning. In truth  the character resembles a drag queen  not someone in the midst of transitioning.<br /><br />These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really aren't connected to transpeople. The film's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition. Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least. At the very least  why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that. Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte  a very complex character full of energy  self-loathing  desire and contradictions. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy  a Charlotte could go out to a women's bar in two seconds and find it. Yes  she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male/female characteristics (a gentle touch but with a good punch)  not as a unique person. Yes  what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving  but that doesn't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process.<br /><br />This film also proves that Danes are lousy dancers. For such a promising premise (better executed in a film like Different For Girls) the final film is a letdown.,negative
"I know that Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and spoof them in every single episode of South Park (if not showing them  then mentioning them) and they love to mock and joke and make fun of themselves too  but I felt this mockumentary went too far.<br /><br />For one thing  the most common running theme in the documentary is that they're episodes are meaningless pieces of crap they put out just for the money. Obviously  that's completely untrue if you even bother to watch any episode  and the constant You know, I learned something today...'s said at the end of almost every episode by the main characters. The creators are also depicted as pompous  arrogant asses who only care about money  including a supposed-to-be-funny-but-isn't scene involving Isaac Hayes delivering lines for Chef (over the phone) and Trey Parker yelling and screaming at him for sucking and hanging up. I guess it's supposed to be funny  but the pretension in it just really made it... cringe.<br /><br />The way they interview employees working for Trey and Matt shows the duo as tyrants who push their employees to the limit  all just for money  in the end. Completely untrue  obviously  and all a joke  but it's just not funny. It's disturbing  even though it's just a joke.",negative
If you take the films  Mad Max  Beyond Thunderdome  and the movie Steel Dawn with Patrick Swayze  you will have a pretty good idea what the film is about. The only problems is  that the film lacks the production values of either  and represent mainly cheap copy of the former two. True  the film has plenty of action  but asks the viewer to suspend belief. No one can shoot a 50 Caliber Machine gun by holding it in his hand - and miss everything to boot  nor can you shoot at a group of people with an automatic weapon and miss the whole bunch. There is also a problem with poor editing  when the school bus flips over  it is easy enough to see the cannon used to do the job. And the lady driving the truck through it is superfluous  since she had more than enough time to stop the truck. If you are interested only in mindless action and violence then the movie is easy enough to watch. But don't expect anything on paar with Thunderdome  or even the somewhat cheap and tacky Steel Dawn.,negative
As other reviewers have noted  this movie is a cross between (i.e. stolen from) stories we have seen before. Specifically  this looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter inserted into Mad Max. Remove Clint's cigar  and replace with a cigarette; remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle  and voilà  an updated drifter. In this movie  the hero is even more blatantly a Savior than High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair  suffers a wound to his left side  and his entry into town is preceded by a plea for salvation by the surviving townspeople--a pretty transparent reference to a Second Coming. I watched the movie on a hot  humid morning. Sleep was impossible and upon arising at 4:30 am  there was nothing else on TV. So the movie served its purpose. While unoriginal  with characters that are almost comic caricatures  the movie is still somewhat entertaining...at least at 4:30 in the morning.,negative
The first 20 minutes were a little fun because I don't think I've seen a film this bad before {acting  script  effects (!)  etc....} The rest of the running time seemed to drag forever with every cliche in dialog used to no effect. These people seemed to not really like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie. There's no adult language  a bit of brief nudity  and no gore except fake blood smeared over no open wounds  etc.. It would have been rated PG in the early eighties and PG-13 nowadays. I'm not sure how it got an R rating or if it really did. I saw the American International release titled Hospital Of Terror. I've seen 100 horror films in the past 12 months and this is probably the worst film I've ever seen. Here's an example of how bad it is: There's one scene where something green comes through the door. I'm not sure what it's supposed to be but what it is on screen is some kid's green crayon scribblings {I'm not exaggerating} super-imposed over the film  semi-moving inside the door  then its supposed to do something to Nurse Sherri to possess her I suppose. I could not believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment.,negative
"I made it about 8 minutes into Steel Frontier before I turned it off. Then  glutton for punishment that I am  I watched some more the next day. Today I had to iron a pile of clothes  so I decided to finish the movie  and that was its own punishment. Here's what I don't understand: Robert Rodriguez and Shane Carruth each spent $7 000 on their debut features and created two remarkable movies. Yet here we have two directors with arguably way more money  and they churn out a huge  steaming pile of crap. Let me see if I can figure out the logic: It's 'Road Warrior' but it's like a future Western. We'll get the cheapest 'actors' we can find, we'll have my mentally challenged cousin write the script, and we'll spend the budget on a bunch of explosions. We can't lose!<br /><br />Seriously. I don't think even the MST3K guys could improve this. But if you insist on watching it  I recommend getting very drunk first.",negative
I just finished watching Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities. The acting wasn't too bad and the plot wasn't bad. BUT  as the saying goes  the devil was in the details.<br /><br />Some examples:<br /><br />1) The bleed-through on Charlie Falon's (Sam Elliott) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding.<br /><br />2) Would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well-lighted area? This seemed very silly to me.<br /><br />I am not unusually picky about a movie but  in my humble opinion  this one is definitely NOT recommended by me.,negative
Although the story is good and portrayals what I expected of Sam Elliot my DVD copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the whole film.<br /><br />I would therefore be very careful in purchasing any DVD of the film without checking for the problem.<br /><br />I would also follow the recommended censors classifications particularly in relation to language and drug usage.<br /><br />This film could become a silent classic cop movie and with the above cautionary notes I can recommend it to prospective viewers,negative
This time The Beastmaster(Marc Singer) returns only to face off a new enemy Arklon(Wings Hauser) however due to an annoying teenager(Kari Wuher) they are transported to the future where they then duke it out. Lots of (lame) fish out of water jokes ensue. You honestly don't get sequels this rotten to the core. Beastmaster 2 is a painful movie to behold. The references and hipness date the film badly (This was made in 1991) and really who wants to see The Beastmaster in the present times? Also of note is Wings Hauser who's embarrassing performance is easily the film's best asset. Singer looks awkward  Wuher is irritating and the whole 1991 slang just makes the movie downright unwatchable. This is easily one of the worst movies ever made.<br /><br />1/2* out of 4-(Awful),negative
This is the greatest example I can think of to prove the theory that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas  they make an awful sequel and ruin the first one. Now don't get me wrong  I absolutely love the first Beastmaster; I even liked the third one pretty good  but this movie is atrocious. I am a huge fantasy/sword & sorcery movie fan and I hated to see such a terrible sequel made to such a classic as the first Beastmaster. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well  where do I begin? First of all  the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous. Dar and his evil older brother Arklon(who was nowhere mentioned in the first movie..Huh?) cross over into our world via a handy dimensional time-portal gate. Ya see  Earth just happens to be on the same parallel interdimentional plane as Dar's world. Whereas with the first movie  you're led to think the movie just takes place in the past  but with this one you're shown it's a completely whole other world altogether...that's just one of the many things I hated about this sequel. It didn't work with Masters of the Universe  and it sure doesn't work here either! Movies like this should take place and stay in their own time-line and their usual surroundings. For Christ's sake  what's next? Hercules in New York...er  uh..bad example! Moving on...<br /><br />Arklon's after a device called a neutron detonator to use as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom. So  it's up to Dar  his ferrets his eagle and his tiger(not a spray-painted one this time) to go off and save the world...but along the way they have the help of a young  cool  and hip Senator's daughter who gets caught up in this whole mess and she show's Dar around L.A.  takes him for a joyride in her BMW  and helps get him out of tight situations here and there. How convenient right? And speaking of convenient  I found it awfully convenient and easy for Arklon to sneak into a highly guarded military base and get away with a stolen  highly destructive nuclear weapon...even with half the U.S. Army and L.A.P.D. after him....waaaaay to easy  even for an evil barbarian sorcerer from another world. There are sooo many plot holes in this I don't know where to begin; like why did Arklon go to the L.A. zoo for at the end of the movie?!? He absolutely has no reason whatsoever to go there; and wouldn't that be like the last place you'd lure your greatest enemy who just so happens to have the handy ability TO CONTROL ANIMALS?<br /><br />And don't you just love these kinds of movies where the police are portrayed as total idiots and even with half a dozen cops firing at one guy  they still don't manage to hit him? The police in this movie belong in the Police Academy series! They are about as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind! Even the title of the movie makes no sense: Beastmaster 2 : Through the Portal of Time...they never actually went through a time portal because the movie isn't set in the future of Dar's world  it's set in a parallel world along ours in the astral plane  so they NEVER actually go through time  only a dimensional world along theirs; so NO actual time-travel is involved at all! This movie tries to come off as funny and it does...not because of the humor  but because it's just so bad...and that's putting it mildly. The acting  dialogue  plot  characters  and ending are all so cheesy it's hilarious. What more can I expect from the guy that brought us Return of the Swampthing(another bad sequel)? Sorely missed here is Don Coscarelli's wonderful directing and serious feel of the first one!! Avoid this stinking piece of garbage like the bubonic plague and stick which the first one and maybe the third one if there's nothing better on T.V.,negative
Truly flatulent script  and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer for agreeing to be in it.<br /><br />I actually walked out of the theater about 15-20 minutes into it  and demanded my money back. I have actually walked out of a movie only 3 times in my life (I am 43 years old) and this is the only one that made me mad enough to demand my ticket price back. If I could have  I would have gotten a refund on the popcorn  too. This was a truly lousy movie  and there is no excuse.<br /><br />For one thing  how does someone who was raised as a pre-tech barbarian learn to DRIVE A CAR? IN California!!!? (Driving a car is a somewhat tricky skill  and in California  even tricker...I should know  I live there.),negative
I love the first and third Beastmasters  but this one was an abomination. It was almost as horrible as 'The Never Ending Story 3'  for the same reasons. They took a fascinating fantasy world of Barbarian tribes  farming villages  witches  supernatural creatures  and a cult of religious fanatics using a pyramid; and thought it would be funny to mix in our materialistic pop-culture world of rock & roll  sushi (I think thats what it was)  and flashy sports cars. These two worlds do not belong together. I do not want to see a bunch of ancient barbarian looking people dancing to some rock song on the car radio. I have a sense of humor  but this is just stupid. This is what Hollywood does to good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas. Don't give up though  the Eye of Braxus is much  much better. That one I gave a 10. This one  Portal of Time  I give a 1. Believe me  I don't always give such extremely high or low ratings. I just tend to comment only such movies.,negative
"If you are ever in the mood for a truly terrible film  it would be hard to find something that could even compare to this. I have spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the sheer joy I get from it  and man  this is one of the worst. This movie was so bad  I had to buy the third Beastermaster online. That one wasn't as bad  which is amazing since it was straight to video. This is one of those films that is hard to comprehend how it was made in the first place. I mean  someone had to actually have read the script (or many scripts  I'm sure they made several drafts) and said Yeah, that's it. Here's some money. Actually  they probably just wanted to make a Beastmaster 2 before they even had a script  then went with whatever they had. Ack  horrible. So  if you are a fan of really bad movies  watch this one. It is a true classic  and film doesn't get much worse than this. And if it does  please let me know.",negative
This one kind of is like an earlier movie from 1987 Masters of the Universe based on the cartoon He-man. Basically  you have a great old world and they for some reason have to have nearly all the action of the movie take place on modern earth. Well I guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an ancient world now of strangeness and a den of good times gone by. Well I guess I can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie. To save money on costumes and sets. It is a lot easier to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of Eternia in He-man or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids  sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death. This movie is forgettable and not very entertaining  your first clue that it is not going to be the best movie in the world is that Robert Z'Dar is in it. The only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last. Marc Singer is back and it is sad to seem him in this state  the guy was a fairly good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one  and even if it did it came five years to late.,negative
Mr. Bean is just a bunch of unfunny slapstick humour. It is the most shallow humour TV series ever made in history. The scenes are often disgusting and the horrible canned laughter sends chills through the spine. Mr. bean is a selfish and rude character and one can only sympathies how pathetic he is. It is incredible that such a TV series of low quality can be sustained for 5 years. It is a complete waste of time to watch even 1 episode and one can't help but to express disgust and pity why Rowen had portrayed himself as such a 2-dimensional  unfunny and ridiculous character. Or pity yourself why you had even bother to watch an episode. Watching this is an aggravating experience.,negative
I only came here to check Terror Hospital for an alternate title so I'd know what not to pick up. Not only do I get the original title  but I come to find Terror Hospital is one of seven more aliases.This one is a real clunker. Movies like this can usually be forgiven for any number of reasons  mostly unintended consequences of the feature on every level of production that result in at least a mild form of entertainment  mostly amusement. This has none of that. Instead  the viewer is witness to redundantly unnecessary and way-too-convenient-for-the-situation exposition and drawn out scenes of characters warily moving from room to room  and all this is half of the film. Forget trying to figure out where anybody is (or who they are) during darkened or nighttime scenes  too; you probably won't care  anyway. There is also a random car chase sequence that seems quite dull when compared to some of the old driver's ed movies I slep... er  I mean sat through and watched way back in high school. Really  we're talking about mysticism  possession  and a killer on the loose here - not a bad recipe for trash cinema. Unfortunately  there's nothing here to make it even good trash; when joined to the aforementioned  the bad acting and not-so-special effects are just that - bad acting and not-so-special effects. This one's just trash  pure and simple. Leave it on the rack at the pawn shop or in that box at the yard sale. There's a reason its there...,negative
Starts off with Fulci playing a version of himself  writing down some ideas for how people could die. Followed by a fake-looking cat eating what is presumably a brain. The copy I watched was dubbed in English  which I always hate  but I was particularly disappointed not to get to hear Fulci in his own voice.<br /><br />Fulci is in a sort of feverish state working on his latest horror movie. His stomach turns when he sees things that resemble effects from his movie  and he starts to hallucinate that he is witnessing acts of horror. He visits a psychiatrist  who hypnotizes him and unfortunately he does not have his improved mental health in mind. I was reminded of the psychiatrist played by David Cronenberg in Clive Barker's Nightbreed (1990). The shrink in this one is played by David L. Thompson  who is pretty bad. Probably a real life friend of Fulci's  he has a big toothy grin when he kills people  though this may be Fulci's black humor at work which I thought was pretty poor too.<br /><br />The movie is composed of a lot of clips from Fulci's movies  either as if Fulci is on the set directing them  watching recordings on TVs  or witnessing the acts. I've never been too much of a fan of clip shows in TV series  and I also think things like Charles Band's Full Moon Entertainment cutting their old films down and putting three such cuts together as new anthologies are pretty lame. I guess they need to make money?<br /><br />The shrink in Cat in the Brain makes reference to the theory that violence in movies begets violence in real life. One of Fulci's co-workers talks about having a documentary crew follow Fulci to see what his life is like. Lots of self-referential stuff like this.<br /><br />In the end  some of the characters sail away on a boat named Perversion.,negative
What do you do with all the material that does not make the final edit of a film? You might keep it aside in case a director's cut or extended version is released one day. You might sell some it as stock footage to be used in a part of another film. You might just bin it. Or you might collect it  accumulating more and more from each film you make and then use it to make another film  disregarding coherence or any sense. Throw a very primitive skeleton of a narrative into it and line up a number opportunities (nay  excuses) to slot in your celluloid cast-offs. Excuse the abjectly nonsensical nature of the plot by framing it all in the mind of a horror film director and you've got yourself an awful film. This can all be done with just a few days shooting. And idiots like me will waste two hours of their life watching it. And then come on here and try to warn others away. The whole chain of events is one big waste of time.,negative
Dr. Lucio Fulci (Lucio Fulci) is a director of gory horror movies who is starting to feel the effect of having filmed too many bloody scenes. He visits his local psychiatrist to see if he is losing his marbles; this proves to be a bad idea  since the shrink is actually a crazy murderer responsible for a spate of grisly killings. Seizing the opportunity to make Fulci his fall guy  the loopy nut doctor hypnotises the horror hack into thinking that he is responsible for the recent series of murders.<br /><br />On the surface  Cat in the Brain appears to be a fantastically gory treat from spaghetti-splatter god Lucio Fulci. Chock full of chainsaw dismemberment  axe attacks and various other bloody killings  the film certainly spills enough claret for even the most hardened gore-hounds. But when one looks closer  it turns out that many of the gruesome scenes are lifted from earlier movies (mostly Fulci's own 'masterpieces'); remove these from the equation and one is left with a nifty basic plot idea that is totally wasted  some welcome nudity  and dreadful performances from Fulci himself and David L. Thompson as the psycho shrink.<br /><br />As the film progresses  it develops into an incomprehensible mess  with the 'borrowed' gore footage inserted randomly  with no attempt at working it convincingly into the story. If you've seen Fulci's Touch of Death and Ghost's of Sodom  or Mario Bianchi's the Murder Secret  then you've already seen the best bits of Cat In The Brain before.<br /><br />After much bloodletting  the film wraps itself up rather quickly  leaving the viewer feeling bewildered and somewhat cheated. Watch the film if you're a Fulci completist  but I would suggest seeking out the films from which the 'good bits' were taken.,negative
I classify this as the worst movie of all time.<br /><br />If there ever was a movie I would wish upon my enemies  this would be it. The plot is ridiculous  there are only 2 characters  and the coincidences between these characters just completely strain belief.<br /><br />These factors combined to make this an extremely boring movie.<br /><br />My wife and mother walked out on the movie about 15 minutes in. I figured that a movie this boring and slow *must* have some cool interesting plot twist  and a was quite disappointed when nothing exciting materialized.<br /><br />I briefly considered sending the filmmakers a bill for my 2 hours of lost life.,negative
This is possibly the hands down worst movie every made  that actually took itself seriously. And not as a result of the acting  because being an actor  I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be at their best  just to escape needing electro convulsive therapy after the principle photography wrapped. Being one of the 57 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release  I have to say I have never before or since experienced a movie where the movie ended  credits rolled  the house lights went on  and no one moved from their seats. About five minutes after the house lights went up people started coming out of their comas to look around  and I think most of us thought  okay we get it  that was a joke  right?  they are going to show the real movie now. Eventually  after the ushers handed out disguises  and we swore an oath of secrecy to never admit we were there  we felt that it was safe to leave  praying that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium. I have seen some pretty bad movies in my day  (I have Cinemax for goodness sakes)  but I am still bitter that I will never  ever be able to recover those two or so hours of my life that I lost watching Closet Land.,negative
Closet Land is a nasty piece of work with superb actors. Nothing more (or less) happens in the movie besides the unending abuse of an attractive woman prisoner by a sadistic police official. The setting is minimalist. This might be considered soft core S&M porn because the drama is devoid of all reference points such as time  place  and political context. Since what happens is cut adrift in a fantasy futuristic environment  the abuse becomes purely personal. The pornographic aspects are justified by being a warning about the evils of totalitarian government  but because there is no real context for the torture of this young woman  we come away disturbed but having learned nothing.<br /><br />What is the point? That torture exists in the world? That abusing prisoners is bad? That dictatorships abuse innocent people? We know that already. Closet Land has echoes of such works as Darkness At Noon and Ionesco's Rhinoceros  but both those works were made by competent artists whose work had historical context and depth of meaning. This work is amateurish and the dialogue sophomoric. A definite thumbs down.,negative
This movie includes 2 well known actors I have previously enjoyed watching. There actions are great and each action is heart felt. But it makes me think these 2 were thrown into a speech/drama class at college for the first time and told for one to act dominating and constricting to the other in a room without allowing her to leave and the woman to be truly innocent and treat her with enough mind-humping to drive the audience into tears for her release.<br /><br />The only good part IS the acting abilities  the plot has the same ruse as Hitlers influence and I started to hate the protagonist for that. But all of this could have been done within 15 minutes in my opinion  so to drag it out for over an hour was just pure punishment for all who watched it.<br /><br />,negative
The best scene of The People Across The Lake is the genuinely creepy  nightly opening-scene featuring a house  a murder & a lake. After that  it's pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned. A family (mom  dad  sister & younger brother) is fed up with the (mildly) dangerous environment of suburbia  and decides to go and live near the titular lake. From then on  the film features too much lame happy family-related doo-doo near the lake  with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there. The couple of scenes where they discover the bodies  are pretty convincing (in terms of creepiness)  but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goings-on (featuring just every-day-life stuff of the family settling in). The truth to the matters (the mystery as to who's doing the killing) is learned too soon  leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale (featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house)  like if this made-for-TV thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film. It's not really badly made; the content & story is just not interesting enough. The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin  though his performance/character is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious. Blond cutie Tammy Lauren (the daughter) might be a recognisable face for avid horror junkies too  as she also starred in Wishmaster (1997)  and made-for-TV outings like I Saw What You Did (1988) & The Stepford Children (1987). She hasn't got much to do in this film  though. Skippable  but watchable  if anything.,negative
It's been over 30 years now but I still remember that this movie was the worst I've ever seen. I would have thought that in this length of time something worse would have been filmed but I was mistaken. I just finished watching STARSHIP TROOPERS and it came mighty close but it was still more entertaining than  POOR COW .,negative
Now  I loved Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang  but I cannot believe Shane Black wrote this pile...or that David Morse and John C. McGinley are in it. I screened it for a film festival. Awful. Everyone was laughing. It's preachy and heavy handed...not to mention stupid. Also  it's surprising how little L.A. looks like Cambodia. The entire idea of time traveling through post-traumatic stress disorder is kinda dumb. Imagine Born on the Fourth of July mixed with The Butterfly Effect 2 (I used to sequel as the example to really show how bad this movie is) but directed by Michael Bay's 2nd unit director. That bad. The 2 stars are purely based on the production value.,negative
i have one word: focus.<br /><br />well.<br /><br />IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. okay. let's discuss the fine points of focus. i don't know about the rest of you  but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless crap  like 'you'll all be famous avant-garde filmmakers someday'--but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called FOCUSING the lens! it was amazing! you give a little twist and wham! everything is clear as a bell. the person who shot what alice found needs to learn a few things about the finer points of focus. lighting  too. this movie is not only completely out of focus  it's also lit like the corner of someone's basement.<br /><br />don't even get me started on pacing or plot. they could have trimmed about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shot.<br /><br />but who cares about that anyhow? there is not enough lurid in this movie to make up for the utter lack of regard to film's best friends--FOCUS  and LIGHTING.<br /><br />words to the wise.,negative
"This is a hard film to rate. While it truly deserves its 3 (or perhaps even a two)  for an Al Adamson film  it's exceptional--and practically Adamson's very best. That's because unlike many Adamson films  there are times when NURSE SHERRI almost looks competent. But  being an Adamson film  you know that sooner or later that crappiness MUST rear its ugly head! <br /><br />The film begins with some bizarre cult leader of a huge congregation (six) trying to resurrect a dead guy who looks like he's made of blue cheese. However  in the process  the cult dude has a heart attack and it taken to the hospital. He apparently dies  but it also seems like many of these hospital scenes are missing and a few of them appear much later in the film. In other words  when you see the film  he appears to have possibly recovered--only to hear later that he'd died. Because the guy is the b.f.f. of Satan  however  his evil soul can't die and he comes back to both haunt one of his henchmen and to possess Nurse Sherri.<br /><br />Now  Sherri is obviously a very disturbed lady--demonic possession or not. At times she acts like a zombie and at others she's violently homicidal. So I ask...why didn't her boyfriend (a doctor) think this was, perhaps, problematic?!. In other words  after trying to kill a patient  he neither gets an exorcist nor commits her to the booby hatch!!! Oh  and speaking of boobies...this movie is NOT the breast-filled sex romp its title and posters would indicate. While there are a few bare breasts here and there  they are irrelevant to the plot and only seen very briefly (1/2 second or so) in all but one scene. So  if you are a perv  this movie is not for you--though a few places in the film (such as the nurse undressing for a patient) make it look like the film MIGHT have  at one time  been designed as a porn flick.<br /><br />If you are a bad movie fan  however  there is enough to whet your appetite. Some examples of incompetence are the inability of many of the actors to deliver lines that aren't zombie-like--and I am not even talking about Sherri. Especially noticeable is one of the very final scenes--I have never seen and heard some stilted acting and dialog in my life--and this includes Ed Wood's films! There are also a few more cheap touches  such as the bad animation of the green stuff  the doctor finding a murdered nurse yet continuing to investigate in a house where walls are covered in blood (I'd get a cop...better yet  an army of cops).<br /><br />So despite these problems  why do I think it's good for an Adamson film? Well  the story isn't all bad and he was able to build tension very well. Many false alarms early on made my heart race a bit. Also  the car crash  while irrelevant  came off pretty well and was practically big-budget for Adamson.<br /><br />Overall  not a good film and one most people would be bored watching. However  fans of Adamson or inept films will like it--it does deliver some entertainment in a cheesy manner that will provide a few laughs.",negative
Really  average is the only word that comes to my mind when you see this.<br /><br />The acting was average (maybe a bit above average)  the camera usage was average (actually below average. The picture was so shaky and the colors were grainy and blurry.) The plot was a good one but moved at such a slow pace and wasn't put to good use.<br /><br />This could've been so much more if it didn't go at a snail pace and we saw more into the characters backgrounds.<br /><br />All we see are flashbacks here and there of Alice and how her home life is so bad (her mother is a working class woman trying to make end meet for her and her daughter.) We see a flashback of her of when she was in high school and her friend says to her tell your Mom to make some better food and everybody says it's your mom. Yeah that's embarrassing but why would you run away from it. <br /><br />I could definitely see if her Mom was a drunk or somebody was abusing her but nothing was wrongwith her home except she was embarrassed by it. How immature! <br /><br />We're not even given a glimpse of what the couple's lives have been like (except that they've been prostituting for awhile and the woman  forgot her name  gave her baby up when it was 9 months old.) This really could've been so much more. It could've had Alice who was abused by her drunk mom go down to Florida with her friend but then becomes a prostitute. Or something along the lines of that other then the real plot of this movie (that is) Alice  a girl with a home life of probably 90% of America's population (WORKING CLASS) runaways to Florida but then gets sidetracked by turning into a prostitute.<br /><br />I don't see why it won an award at Sundance (it must've been up against some really weak competition to have won that one award.) <br /><br />Also to me  Alice's Boston/New England accent seemed forced. It didn't seem genuine. (I should know  I was born and raised in Boston  but now live in Georgia.) <br /><br />4/10 Not really worth your time in my opinion.,negative
This is one of those movies I watched  and wondered  why did I watch it? What did I find so interesting about it? Being a truck driver myself  I didn't find it very realistic. No  I've never used a 'lot lizard'  nor have I ever seen  nor heard about one traveling around the country in a brand new seventy thousand dollar RV  either.<br /><br />Same thing about a pimp whom has never sampled the lady in question (until the end of the movie  and well  he still really didn't...)  and only getting 50 bucks 'a cut'  when the prostitute gets $200.00 (well  $150.00 after his cut  yeah...).<br /><br />I still laugh at the lot lizard comment Ivey made (them's Lot Lizards  they'll screw anything with 20 bucks  and some are men dressed as woman... or something equally as weird)  meaning  we're better then them  as we may still be prostitutes  but we get paid BETTER.<br /><br />Other then that  it's just a story of a young woman whom wanted something more from life then a dead end job while living at home (she's 18  remember?) and embarrassed by her mother basically doing the same thing (dead end job). At least she had a roof over her head and a job. She turned FIVE tricks on the road... I wonder if the $750.00 she made was worth it? I'd guess not.,negative
Kazuo Komizu  who hasn't made one decent film  directed this notorious shocker and should be ashamed that it was a hit upon its Japanese release.<br /><br />Yes  it does feature scenes of rape  gore and dismemberment  but so what? It has the style of a bad American porn film shot and badly photographed by Ed Powers (Dirty Debutantes) and is incredibly slow.<br /><br />It seems to have earned its notoriety based on its roster of anti-social acts.<br /><br />There is a huge difference between this and horror that is well produced.<br /><br />Just because someone likes their cinema a little wet does not mean they'll accept crap like this. On the contrary  that kind of fan (myself  for example) tolerates even less crap than the average punter out there because he's seen so much and has become overly discerning. It's a shame production companies don't realize that.<br /><br />One reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) commented that the film's near obsession with gang rape is one of the factors that killed it. I disagree. The subject matter is never the issue. The issue is how that subject matter is treated. In ENTRAILS OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN  it is treated so unimaginatively that it is boring.<br /><br />Personally  I like graphic depictions of psychopathic behavior (with an intriguing context) if the material is well directed  freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror/pink hybrid is woeful.,negative
This program was shown in an early morning time slot on SPACE  a cable sci-fi station. I am amazed that anyone would pay for this or broadcast it; it is incredibly amateurish.<br /><br />The entire show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a closet with a bunch of circuit boards taped to the wall. There is very little continuity between scenes  and no plot. A typical scene revolves around some lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long. The dialog makes little sense and the special effects look like Photoshop filters. The actors are all adults  but I have literally seen high-school plays with better writing and sets. This program is an embarrassment.<br /><br />Perhaps each scene would work as an interstitial; a filler between shows instead of commercials. Stringing all the scenes together makes the limitations of the material extremely obvious.,negative
The opening of MORTE A VENEZIA resembles a Duran Duran music video with classical music and this is the highlight of the movie <br /><br /> In terms of what Theo ?  <br /><br />In terms of everything   but especially excitement . I doubt if there's ever been a more sluggish slower moving movie than this one . Yeah okay it's a European art house movie so I wasn't expecting Charles Bronson to massacre hordes of bad guys but even so I did expect some substance if not an actual plot <br /><br />The film revolves around Professor Gustav Von Aschenbach visiting Venice . Gustav visits Venice and goes on a gondola   Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant   Gustav looks out of his hotel window and if it's excitement you want Gustav has a flashback <br /><br />Bad enough if this was the entire movie but it gets worse because Gustav notices a pretty boy teenager . So you've got a middle aged academic lusting after some teenage boy he has seen   some old queen is becoming obsessed with a stranger . Great idea for a movie ? I don't think so either and thank gawd it remained a yawn fest instead of some sleazy precursor to gay porn <br /><br />I notice a lot of people who praise this movie have tried to intellectualise it . I can only be monosyllabic and unpretentious in my view and say that the only subtext I could relate to was the physical and emotional disintegration of Gustav but it wasn't caused by the effete beauty of the teenage boy - It was caused by watching such a boring and ostentatious movie,negative
I was entertained to see that some of the reviews here were topped with **SPOILERS** the joke in my family is that the only part of this movie that isn't given away on the back of the box  is given away in the title. Perhaps I am just a dense American 17-year-old who wouldn't know art if it bit me in the leg  but I prefer movies that have at least some words. This movie makes the second half of 2001: A Space Odyssey down right chatty. This movie is just so slow it isn't even art  it is merely boring. We follow this creepy guy who is following this boy around Venice. The end was incomprehensible until I read the end of book. A movie shouldn't make you refer back to the book  it should be able to stand alone. This movie has no way to stand. It doesn't even have the bones of a plot to lean on.,negative
This...... Movie.... Is..... Horrible!!!!!! You won't believe this hunk of junk is even a movie!!!! Critters4 was better then this!!! And Critters4 was pretty frigging bad too!!! A bunch of stupid teens crash in a desert  find an old run down bungalow  and end up fending off horrifically badly stop motion animated spiders. Pardon my french  but the acting was bad as hell!!! The person who wrote this probably didn't even know what a spider is  because he had the spiders living in a colony serving an alien-queen-ripoff queen spider! SPIDERS DO NOT LIVE IN COLONIES!!!!!!!!! THIS MOVIE IS A PIECE OF CRUD!!! At the end  the marines suddenly pop out of no where and kill all the spider without even being called!!!! If you see a copy of this movie at a video store  douse it in gasoline and throw a match at it!!!!,negative
My wife and I watched this after DVR'ing it off of Encore action this past week. It has to be the worst horror flick either of us had ever seen. Predictable dialogue ( my wife and I were guessing the lines before they were spoken)  hokey special effects  a screenplay that drifted all over the place. I think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotyping of the various characters in the plot  not to mention the gratuitous sex scene between two of the young heroines in the movie  neither of which had any real purpose other than to bare certain parts of their anatomy for the cameras. This movie should be categorized as comedy  not horror as the villains of the movie (spiders) were stop motion animated and not believable in the least. I can't say that I would have done a better job making a film myself  but it was very amateurish and wasn't even a B movie  somewhere closer to a d movie  or f if that is possible. I think even Science Fiction 3000 would have to pass on this one!,negative
I usually love these movies. Give me a good old B movie any day but this one was simply awful. The acting(?) was terrible almost to the point of my turning the movie off completely. I thought I saw the all time worst but this one is right up there with Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! In all honesty - it was the acting that did this film in for me.<br /><br />I found the actor's to be clumsy and the lead male/female were extremely dull. This movie had absolutely nothing going for it. I may be asking a ridiculous question here but why the nudity and sex scene? Did the producers think nobody would watch if they left them out? I think they were probably right! Oh where is Price and The Tingler when you need them?,negative
This is one of those movies that you watch because it's bad. Such a movie that you watch just to see it's shitty craftsmanship. Supposedly a horror  I cannot imagine how anyone can be afraid of a claymation bug  especially one that is translucent in nature where you can see the actor's legs behind it.<br /><br />Even with no budget  a little bit of attention to detail and even an attempt at making this movie believable would have sucked the fun right out of it  as they would have had to replace all of the actors and the entire story with it. If I had nothing to make fun of while it was playing  I would have stopped it after 10 minutes  and put on some quality show like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAR HAR HAR).<br /><br />I Strongly recommend that Brett Piper get with Quintin Terrantino and Really pump out some feces.<br /><br />:),negative
I watched this movie based on the comments of a few that said that is was bad but funny. But you need to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever produced. They make 1950s science fiction movies look like works of art. This is funny at times  but annoying for the most part. And to compound the problem with the seriously pathetic special effects is the total lack of logic that characterized a majority of the events depicted. One of my favorites is where three of the characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel created by the arachnia and arrive to find it fully lit. Apparantely the arachnia have also managed to hook into the power grid. Very impressive. But this is just one example. And for what its worth  the music sucks  the acting sucks  the two cute girls are annoying  the obnoxious guy is annoying  the so-called handsome lead man is a geek  and the black girl who fall for him is a fool. Her father is the worst actor I have ever seen. I am not sure the brief moments of humor can possibly make up for the experience.,negative
I bought this on VHS as Terror Hospital  and when I got home I checked IMDb and was like OMG it's the legendary Nurse Sherri!!! So here's another one from Al Adamson  who had clearly learned some minuscule amount about film-making since the Blood of Dracula's Castle days. Where that earlier effort is a more or less totally sclerotic lump  this one mixes it up a little  adding a definite element of variety and surprise amid the incompetence. Sure half of the movie is a blind post-op football player shooting the breeze with his stacked nurse  but at any moment we might be cutting away to the cackling disembodied head of the satanist mastermind  or Nurse Sherri running a farmer through with a pitchfork  or a wee bit of abstract student-film quick cutting to go with the pulsing-blob effects in the possession scene  or the most gratuitously half-hearted topless bit ever  or god knows what else (I forget  to be honest). As dumb-ass pieces of sh*t go  this one runs toward the high end. Congrats  Al.,negative
36/100. This is not to be confused with the decent Arachnophobia  this film is a very low budget and cheap rip-off of that movie. This one is so bad  it actually does have some entertainment value on that level. There are numerous unintended (I think) laugh out loud scenes. I wasn't expecting much from the film  and it was actually worse than I had imagined it would be.<br /><br />It's a cliché ridden and predictable direct to video mess. Fortunately  it doesn't take itself too seriously. The acting  as expected  is not quite Oscar caliber. The special effects are poor  worse than I would have thought they would be. Poorly edited and the score is intrusive.,negative
I picked this up because  having spent time in the Albany region of New York  I knew a couple of people in the movie and I happened upon it by chance. The attempts at comedy are lame  the compulsory girl-on-girl scene is sickening  the plot is nonexistent  the acting is among the worst I've ever seen  and don't even get me started on special effects. I realize this is a very low budget film made by a small independent company  but if you're going to do a sci-fi horror flick with giant bugs  don't make the giant bugs completely unbelievable. People want to see giant bugs. That's half the fun right there. And if you're going to make the giant bugs completely unbelievable  at least get the actors to make some sort of tongue-in-cheek allusion to that fact (You idiots! These aren't them! You've captured their stunt doubles!). Be prepared to waste two hours of your life that you'll never be able to get back.,negative
In a way  you have to respect Arachnia. It's clearly meant as a tribute to the big bug movies of the fifties  and while the special effects look terrible; at least the film doesn't feature CGI. However  on the other hand; you can't respect the film too much because it's a load of rubbish. The acting is terrible  the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously  and once you've seen one giant spider being blown up; you've seen them all  so it gets boring rather quickly. The plot follows a bunch of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; which just happens to be a house where a man has a huge spider he used to use as a circus attraction. Coincidently around the same time  the meteor shower has caused more giant spiders to rise from underground. All the characters in this film are poor caricatures; none of them have anything even resembling a third dimension and they will soon begin to thoroughly bore you. You've got to feel for director Brett Piper as he clearly didn't have much to work with for this film; but that doesn't make Arachnia worth a damn  and overall there are better giant bug films than this  and therefore Arachnia doesn't get the seal of approval from me.,negative
Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: Clearly something bad has happened to Ron Howard. I don't know what exactly  but something has gone very wrong.<br /><br />Howard has always been a decent workman director. While he will never be mistaken for an artistic savant both Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent films  Parenthood was pretty good and even Angels and Demons prequel/sequel The Da Vinci Code was a fun romp. In addition none of his films have been downright awful. (Note I have seen neither How the Grinch Stole Christmas nor his newest film Heidi Montag Says No to Plastic.) Whats more Howard managed to hold this quality is such devise genres as star driven Oscar bait (A Beautiful Mind)  star driven costume drama (Far and Away)  star driven revenge fantasy (Ransom) and comedies about prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift  Splash).<br /><br />Angels and Demons is at its center a poorly directed and shot film. Scenes are too dark  camera angles are all wrong  the actors block each others shots and the whole affair is often out of focus. This makes the telling of an already confusing story even more muddled.<br /><br />Dan Brown gets picked on a lot but I found The Da Vinci Code a fun readable romp (so sue me). The movie version of the Da Vinci code kept the same where are they going to next vibe of the book and added an attractive cast and attractive location shooting.<br /><br />Angels and Demons however takes place in the claustrophobic confines of Vatican City and since Howard wasn't allowed to film in many of the real locations we end up with a lot of running around a CGI back lot. The entire film is as if Rick Steves did a Vatican City special and instead of actually visiting the Holy City and pointing his camera  Rick had to use Lego bricks and a second hand art book with all the tits erased.<br /><br />While the Da Vinci code had what I still think is an intriguing central mystery (again sue me)  Demons and Angels story consists of a plot by the Illuminati (roll eyes now) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and raping every student in the ass repeatedly. Oops my bad; apparently the Vatican doesn't need any help on that one.<br /><br />Anyway their plan is to infiltrate Europe's Large Hadron Collider  kill the head priest  and steal three vials of Anti-matter. This begs more than a few questions. Can the Hadron Collider create anti-matter? Can you capture the anti-matter once created? Why is the EU collecting it? (Perhaps they fear a Godzilla attack?). Why is the head of Anti-matter gathering a Vatican priest? Now once they get the anti-matter they are going to use its incredible destructive power to take over the world no just kidding; unfortunately the Illuminati haven't quite grasped that Pinky and the Brain level of sophistication just yet. Instead the current pope has just died and it's conclave time. The top seeded cardinals for the final four pope tournament are all kidnapped and the Illuminati are killing them one by one Seven style. They being good sports however are leaving clues at every murder like some Latin themed Riddler. Oh and the last kidnapped Cardinal has the anti-matter and if he isn't found in time Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice next year to see decent frescoes. If only there was some Latin themed Batman to save the day? Okay the story is truly awful and it is poorly told  but maybe this is one of those films saved by great performances. A true character study (Okay you know where this is going). Tom Hanks gives an incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful (he is also to old to play the character by about twenty years. ) his love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has zero chemistry with either Hanks or the screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the Pope's personal assistant/cabana boy as an Irish man who looks like he is about to break into a musical number at any moment providing no one steals his Lucky Charms.<br /><br />On the plus side Stellan Skarsgård puts in a fine turn as head of Vatican Security and as far as we know no deaf children were raped during the making of this film which puts it ahead of its Vatican critics in at least one area.,negative
I had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show  I had no expectations.<br /><br />'Angels and Demons' was a muddled  convoluted film lacking direction or any believability. There was very little character development and I never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true  I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are who they are.<br /><br />The film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet. Any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbable.<br /><br />The climax is extremely cliché and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points  it feels very tacked on and unnecessary.<br /><br />The actors are not particularly believable in their roles  mostly because I found it difficult to believe that scientists  professors  and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. Events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time  every time.<br /><br />The most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography  I found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess  that I found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres.,negative
This critique tells the story of 4 little friends who went to watch Angels and Demons the movie on the first night it came out  even though it was a school night  because Angels and Demons is worth it. Two of the four had read the book. Of those that didn't  a guy  was wearing pink skinny jeans. This was the least eventful part of the evening after watching the abhorrent Angels and Demons.<br /><br />The movie starts out in a lab where the antimatter is being created while another process is going on. And apparently someone knows about it or something. Notice how very confused I am.. I don't get what happened: they were just making the antimatter. Vittoria finds her own father dead... WHAT? The Illuminati symbol sent to Langdon is a PRINTOUT  not a burn on someone's chest. They take out the X-33 scene. They take out Maxmillian Kohler. They  pretty much  take out CERN and the symbology connected to it. They take out the Hassasin and replace him with some religious  British dude. They take out the Illuminati Diamond. They take out Vittoria's near-rape scene. They take out Langond's fight with the Hassasin (now British dude on crack). They take out the press dude following them around. They take out the death of the fourth cardinal. They take out the fact that the Camerlengo becomes pope. They take out the Camerlengo's grand scheme. They take out Langdon's being in the helicopter and landing on that island toward the end. They take out the fact that Vittoria's father was a scientific priest. They take out Langdon's fun and most unfortunately  they take out Vittoria's sexual appeal.<br /><br />Other than the movie COMPLETELY losing focus of the details  the movie is acted HORRIBLY. One must admit  though  there were some good things. For example  the Sistine Chapel recreation must have been extremely difficult and it was extremely well done. The explosion scene was MIND-BLOWING. Other than that  SCREW THIS MOVIE FOR RUINING THE BOOK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T READ IT.,negative
An EXTREMELY fast paced exhilarating  interesting  detail rich book. Its a huge shame that the film had none of these qualities. not only was Tom Hanks' mild mannered portrayal or Robert Langdon Laughable  but the name changes to key characters  huge deviances from the original story line  and poor Irish/Italian accent from Carmalengo Played by Ewan Mcgregor  made for the worst book to film EVER.<br /><br />As a huge fan of A&D the book  i had high hopes for a more lavish  true to book detailed movie  where it would start and finish just as the book did - leaving me wanting more.<br /><br />All the film really did was depress me within the 1st 10 minutes.<br /><br />what was impressive was how the... sorry! i couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing.<br /><br />in short - Vittoria was the token hottie  a very second to Audrey Tatou and there were some very nice Alfa Romeos.<br /><br />i would recommend reading the book to understand that  if Ron Howard must insist on making ANOTHER book to film  i would be happy saving my £6.40 for a KFC zinger meal and some chicken wings - far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying!,negative
I went into the movie expecting a little action mixed with a strong story line. I understand that changes between written works and movies must be made...for many reasons.<br /><br />The changing of the relationship between the scientists ( they were father - daughter in the book) The Director of CERN was eliminated thus causing the scene between the Carmelengo and the Director to be changed to the Carmelengo and the head of the Swiss Guard in the Pope's office.<br /><br />Ron Howard made sure to get his dad inserted as a Cardinal with a hayseed accent but missed all the symbolism. Both Lagdon and the Carmelengo ascended to the heavens in the helicopter with Hanks character landing in the river and the priest landing upon the chapel in what was described as a Christ-like image.<br /><br />At some point this film needs to be remade by a director who is up to the job,negative
Recension: Angels & Demons<br /><br />The movie is directed by Ron Howard. He has had also made famous movies like The Da Vinci Code & Cinderella Men. He directed also the famous TV-series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks(The Da Vinci Code The Green Mile  Forrest Gump ) & Ewan McGregor(Cassandra's Dream  Moulin Rouge  Star Wars: The Phantom Menace ).<br /><br />In the begin I was shocked because they changed the beginning from the movie so big. Because they changed the father of Vittoria Vettra(Ayelet Zurer) in someone else  Silvano Bentivoglio(Camren Argenziano). Another Change is that Robert Langdon(Tom Hanks) never goes to the CERN. It was nice that they could film on location in the CERN.<br /><br />Then movie goes on  They are spectacular car races in Rome. An I also like the part in Chirstian Archives very much when they destroy the work of Galileo  it was funny. It was also funny that they where locked in the archives the second time they get in  Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives and when they bust out  the electricity get on<br /><br />I found It very stupid that Robert Langdon not went in the helicopter  but that the Camerlengo(Ewan McGregor) gets in alone  another detail is that in the movie the Camerlengo is an adopted son from the pope. In the book He is the real Son of the pope.<br /><br />When I should give the best acting performance then I should say Pierfrancesco Favino who plays inspector Olivetti. The worst acting was from the assassin  who was played by Nikolaj Lie Kaas  I think he was underachieving  because in Adams Apples he played Faboulous.<br /><br />I think the whole movie is underachieving because director Ron Howard made some many stupid changes. I would rate the movie by 4/10.,negative
I'm a historian. This movie is so wrong it hurts. Tried to watch with an open mind  but if you're going to delve into a movie or anything for that matter of this nature at least do some homework regarding history  locations  church protocol  et cetera. Stop playing to the dumb audience  please. There are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and venture out to the theatre when something of this nature  worthy of a theatrical release comes to town. A little research  all I'm asking. But then again  the book it's based on is somewhat of a joke in itself. So basically  they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay  pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly promoted world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it. I know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspects or just pay someone knowledgeable a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me  there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself.,negative
The film opens with a cult leader attempting to resurrect a dead member with his followers chanting for his rebirth as the sun strikes upon them in the desert. Reanhauer(Bill Roy)believes wholeheartedly in his power  and gets so worked up that he collapses with what appeared to be a heart attack. Unable to keep him alive  all those involved  doctors and nurses  are sentenced for attack with Reanhauer's demonic spirit invading the curvaceous body of nurse Sherri(..big-chested Jill Jacobson)targeting each one using her as a tool of vengeance. Forced against her will  with no memory of inflicting such harm  Sherri's host body murders selected victims. Fortunately  Sherri's fellow co-worker  nurse Tara(Marilyn Joi)begins a rather blossoming romance with a blinded patient  Marcus Washington(Prentiss Moulden)  once a star football player  whose mother was a practitioner of voodoo. Through Marcus' knowledge  passed down from mom  Tara finds out about possession and how to possibly save Sherri before she murders everyone unknowingly. Meanwhile  Sherri's lover  Dr. Peter Desmond(Geoffrey Land)worries about her present condition and welfare.<br /><br />Well  this was my first Al Adamson film and I must agree with his detractors that  just from this film alone  it seems he holds them together with paper clips and Elmer's glue. The animation with which we see the spirit take control of Sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable. A little soft-core nonsense as filler  some demonic possession thrown in the mix(Sherri actually speaks in another voice when she's possessed)  with naughty nurse behavior(..the three nurses focused on in the film all are quite sexually active and free-spirited)and a little bit violence/gore. The film is essentially shot in tiny rooms with dull dialogue from a rather mundane cast. The sexual situations aren't that hard-core and Al often shoots them without revealing all that much. The film looks embarrassingly cheap and there's an absence of thrills  although the chilling score(..which sounds like something from Dark Shadows)does help a little bit. Jacobson and Mary Kay Pass(..as nurse Beth who seems to be a nymphomaniac if she'll even screw a nutty patient  always complaining of illnesses he really doesn't have  with enough chest hair to declare him a Neanderthal)aren't bad looking  and Adamson's story-line  although frail  is somewhat coherent(..it seems he rarely directs films which are). Overall  the movie looks like it cost 5 bucks and Adamson just can not overcome the budgetary restrictions(..or  in my opinion  create an unpleasant enough atmosphere due to a sometimes plodding narrative and tedious scenes which do little for the story). John F Goff has the role of the hospital's psychiatrist who wants to commit Sherri  not believing the idea that she was possessed;he constantly bickers with Peter over her. I watched the unrated lost version which I guess is the real version to watch of Nurse Sherri.,negative
Firstly I loved the book  more so than the more popular Da Vinci Code and although the DVC film was not well received  I liked it and bought the DVD. However  there is no chance that I will ever want to watch Angles and Demons ever again.<br /><br />The film barely resembles the book  in fact only the general premise of the story is there.<br /><br />From the very start of the film I was disappointed  in the book Robert Langdon receives a call and fax from Maximilian Kohler  Director of CERN. Who finds the body of Father (can't remember the name) and then requests Langdon to come  using the super fast plane... In the book the only people who knew about this technology that the Father and Daughter team had created were themselves and the camerlingo... In the film however  there was a massive team involved... so the tension was never there... how did they find out etc.<br /><br />Leaving out or rather changing this whole part of the story was a massive mistake and was in my mind what made it a poor movie... it changed everything that happened from then on  when the Camerlingo was confronted in the pope's locked room  it should have been Maximilian Kohler who shot the video from his wheel chair  the commander rushed in to get the camerlingo but was shot by Olivetti  in the film it was the commander in the room and Olivetti was shot... (err I think I got this right  but I was bored and can't really remember the events in the film)...<br /><br />There was no love interest between Vittoria and Robert and in the book she wasn't at CERN when he arrived and was indeed was flown in from her research work. In the book all four of the preferratti were killed  but in the film the last one of the four survived the fountain. In the book Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue her and it was they that killed the Assassin at the Church of the Illuminati  not blown up like he was in the film by the Camerlingo. The bit where Robert was confined under a stone coffin was not there  saved by his Mickey mouse watch alarm. OK in the book we are led to believe that Langdon bailed out of the helicopter  fair enough to say that this was a bit far stretched  but it was important in the film  because he had to race back with the film... There was no mention of how Vittoria and her adopted father became involved  this was also important in getting to know the character of Vittoria.<br /><br />In all one of the worse films I have seen  I would have left early  but my brain went numb and I lost the use of my legs temporarily. A really really reeeeeeaaaaaaalllly poor attempt and not one of Ron Howards finest  in fact  how he will get work again is beyond me!!! I want my money back!!!,negative
Ron Howard and his editors only had one job to do... Follow the guidelines of the book which was rich  mysterious  moving and highly cinematic in its approach! <br /><br />What they did? They changed EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING! What is left is something that has no right being called Angels & Daemons! <br /><br />I really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way!<br /><br />I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown himself for this film.<br /><br />I really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made  it is pointless.......,negative
The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators  particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to  and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made  including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders  and a few minutes later  he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life  he would be in shock. And  as usual in thrillers  the assassin doesn't kill the heroes  giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed  as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens  ha ha)  and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film  Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting  You are going to be blown up. Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn't spot the baddie? Technically also  the film was awful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear  while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover  many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement  because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter's -- and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magic place  and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.,negative
Why did they not follow the book ... I am really sad and disappointed. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie  however  if you have read the book (maybe recently) it might be very difficult to remain objective. My wife had not read the book  and she loved the movie.<br /><br />Reasons for the disappointment are: 1) Cern's involvement ... gone with the wind  such a shame  there is a very small part at the start  where the antimatter is created  but even that does not stick to the facts (why not  the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand  which is how Langdon got involved would have been a perfect start to the Movie_ 2) Story-line between the (deceased) pope and Camerlegno completely gone ... this completely screws up the motive for the stealing of the antimatter 3) Story-line between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra completely non-existent<br /><br />All-in-all  too flaky storyline  and cannot understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name against it. Maybe I should revisit this film in 10 years time  when I cannot remember the excellent book anymore (fat chance on forgetting the book I am afraid)<br /><br />Really sorry for the negative review  which was spoilt by expectations,negative
I went to see this movie tonight  trying to keep an open mind. I had hoped to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book. There were considerable differences from the book  much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film  in spite of  the changes from the book. It was still enjoyable  filled with action  and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately  Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level. Throughout the movie  symbols are found and figured out quickly  without any interest for the viewer. They blow past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work. The final Illuminati symbol  which was the most interesting and creative one in the book  was replaced with the crossed keys symbol. In my opinion  that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols  which is what the Langdon character is all about. Overall  this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book  and fails at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10,negative
Personally  the book was a very well written  amazing  thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie. Watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me  seeing that it affected the different outcome of the movie. There was something to be desired out of this movie  but all in all  it lacked in plot.<br /><br />For someone who has NOT read the book  I could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. However to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times  I did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel.<br /><br />With major characters missing (such as Maximilian Kohler) and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti  the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story. The Hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man  compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a Muslim; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the Illuminati  however  in the movie  his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand.,negative
It is difficult to imagine how the engaging Dan Brown novel Angels and Demons could misfire as badly as this film version. Here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. Due to the spoilers  please do no read on unless you have already seen the film.<br /><br />(1) In the film  there was no love relationship between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetra. Worse still  there was not even any chemistry between the two leading actors. <br /><br />(2) The breathtaking locations in Rome  as described in the novel  were not realized visually in the film. I am aware that director Ron Howard encountered difficulties in filming on location. But there are superior photographed depictions of Rome on The History Channel than in this film where the Eternal City was presented in eternal stock film footage. The great art works described in the novel were only briefly depicted in the film. The magnificent Bernini sculpture of the Ecstasy of St. Teresa was only momentarily glimpsed  and the West Ponente relief in Vatican Square was not visible at all.<br /><br />(3) The most tasteless choice made by the film-maker was in the depiction of the deceased pope who actually resembled the beloved John Paul II. In the novel  the pope is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real pope.<br /><br />(4) One of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel  Maximilian Kohler  Director of CERN  was cut out of the screenplay.<br /><br />(5) There were numerous instances when the lines of dialog were inaudible due to extraneous background noise.<br /><br />(6) There were moments when the faces of characters were not visible due to the shadows and chiaroscuro film lighting. This technique worked in The Godfather films  but Ron Howard is no Gordon Willis.<br /><br />(7) The College of Cardinals was quite a motley crew with one of the electors speaking in a Southern drawl. This dude would have been more at home on a Texas ranch than in the Sistine Chapel.<br /><br />(8) The crucial relationship of the Camerlengo and the deceased Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was central to the theme of science vs. religion and the relevance of the Illuminati to the plot against the church.<br /><br />(9) In the novel  the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain. In the film  that assassin character's role was a cardboard cutout villain. <br /><br />(10) As a whole  the filmmakers did not trust the workings of the successful novel.<br /><br />In the novel  Langdon makes an impossible fall out of the sky and into the Tiber River. In Ron Howard's film  it was the movie itself that landed in the Tiber.,negative
I'm not in favor of death penalties but in this movie  it couldn't happen fast enough. Just to end the movie. I don't understand why this movie is rated as high as it is. It fooled me into a bad night.,negative
I think I would probably not hate this movie if I spoke Polish. I selected the English version at the first menu  but it gave me Polish dialogue with English subtitles  just as the Polish version did. Maybe the dialogue was so disjointed because the person that did the subtitles could not translate it into English very well. To exacerbate the issue  some of the dialogue had no subtitles at all. The acting was pretty bad  especially the female lead  who was melodramatic about everything! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing and as the mob was jostling her around  her shirt opened and the director showed close-ups of her naked breast for the next 15-20 seconds. I couldn't see how her breast added to the drama of the scene or the film. Maybe the director was trying to increase the numbers of teenage boys in the audience. Much of the film takes place in an extermination camp liberated by the Americans. First  the American uniforms did not look anything like U.S. Army uniforms. Second  none of the extermination camps in Poland were liberated by the Americans. I would think that a Polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an American born in 1966 that all six extermination camps were liberated by the Russians. All in all  it's just not a very good film if you don't speak Polish.,negative
THE EXPERT  starring Jeff Speakman  is the definition of DULL!!!<br /><br />Dull  characters  dull situations  dull direction  dull actors  dull cinematography  dull music.<br /><br />I don't really understand this movie. Is it supposed to be an action movie? It's almost as if Speakman wanted to be in a serious movie but the level of acting and writing found in THE EXPERT is below your average TV drama. And there are some typical Speakman pummeling bad guys scenes here and there but the main aspect of the movie relies on some sort of believable drama  which is totally wrong for Speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with the action star. In the end  this confused movie looks and feels very nondescript and bland. The worst aspect of THE EXPERT is the music. The composer is a Jerry Goldsmith wannabe  with his pompous and melodramatic score  which simply doesn't belong in this kind of (dull) movie. It's as if the producers knew they had a very dull product on their hands and they asked the composer to make the film feel more compelling and dramatic with his score  which makes the entire movie look even more confused  goofier and dull.<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching this  even if you're a Jeff Speakman fan.,negative
"Art-house horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that this is just another serial killer chiller which ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teen sexuality and violent gore. The suburbs come across about as well as they do in every piece of Australian writing (book or film) since 1960 - surprise surprise  the suburbs have a dark underbelly - and the plot is as contrived as any you've seen. The neighbours would never know about this guy, one of the filmmakers says about Joel Edgerton's character. But he was completely plausible as to what he was. Serial killers don't all have patches over their eyes and scars down their cheeks. They look like the guy next door. Another trader in pornographic violence who sees a serial killer in every street. But the real insignificance of this film is in the fact that it's a genre film that nobody saw. Backed by substantial funds (including some from Film Finance - that's government)  this got a run at the Underground Film Festival in Melbourne and had to rely on ACMI kindness for a *very* short release season. Q1: What is the FFC doing funding genre flicks  even if they are 'arty' and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why are these nasty movies (ACOLYTES; BEAUTIFUL; PUNISHMENT; NO THROUGH ROAD) being made in the first place? Richard Wolstencroft & co encourage their creators to believe they're giving the masses what they really want  as opposed to what the culture elite in government funding think they want. The truth is that these brutal and forgettable nasties earn far more critical acclaim - and win far more obscure awards - than they're due.",negative
Oh  well I thought it should be a good action  but it was not. Although Jeff Speakman stars there is nothing to watch.Only two fight for almost 1 5 hours  yak.A lot of talking and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it. The plot is clear from the beginning. If you want good action don't rent this movie.,negative
Jeff Speakman never really made it beyond the lowest ranks of martial-artists-turned-actors (lower than Don The Dragon Wilson  for example)  and with vehicles like The Expert  you can see why. There are three major problems with this movie: 1) The plot - or should I say plots - are all over the place  there are some characters who get a lot of screen time but serve little purpose  2) There are only 4 fight scenes in total  some of them completely unrelated to the main plot and some taking place in the dark  3) The music score is overzealous and overbearing. Strange as it may seem  this is really the most annoying thing about this film: the score persistently tries to convince you that you're watching some sort of grand epic  instead of the low-budget limited-action film you are indeed watching. With all that said  at least there's James Brolin around to lend a touch of credibility. *1/2 out of 4.,negative
An American Werewolf in London had some funny parts  but this one isn't so good. The computer werewolves are just awful: the perspective is all off  it's like seeing them through a distorting mirror. The writers step on the throat of many of their gags. American boy says to Parisian girl  Is there a cafe' around here? Instead of just leaving it at that  they have to have the girl sigh and respond  This is Paris.,negative
This film probably would have been good if they didn't use CGI (computer generated imagery)for the werewolf scenes.It made the creatures look fake and the werewolves looked cartoonish.CGI is great for certain effects like the dinasours in Jurassic Park or Twister.But when we see a film where the creature must look completely real CGI is not the way to go.Look at An American Werewolf in London.No CGI.Just makeup and a mechanical creature and what you come up with was more realistic than what was shown in the sequel.This film did offer a few gags that was fun to watch and the humor in this movie seemed to have drawn me in but it's nothing more than a film that I thought was O.K.And that's not good enough.In my opinion An American Werewolf in Paris doesn't hold up to the original.,negative
An American Werewolf in Paris wasn't really that good compared to the original.The original didn't use computer effects for the werewolf and they looked more realistic .The werewolf effects in this film looked too cartoonish.most of all the movie did not have enough for me for a horror film to enjoy.,negative
There is really but one thing to say about this sorry movie. It should never have been made. The first one  one of my favourites  An American Werewolf in London  is a great movie  with a good plot  good actors and good FX. But this one? It stinks to heaven with a cry of helplessness.<br /><br />,negative
"I was completely bored with this film  melodramatic for no apparent reason. Every thing just becomes so serious and people are swearing with really dumb expressions. Then there is a serial Killer who apparently can Kill one person to get the title of serial Killer. Well the serial Killer likes butterflies and is illustrated by sound effects you might hear in the dream sequence of most modern films;<br /><br />why oh why? I nave no idea. It really really wants to be scary  but I think in this universe scary equals talk a whole bunch and add dark ambient noises.Just for the record  this is in no way is a horror film  its most definitely a thriller (barely). Really movie makers nowadays need to do their homework before making horror films or at least calling a movie a horror film. it makes me say (in too may words ironically) acolytes, you take forever to say nothing.",negative
you will likely be sorely disappointed by this sequel that's not a sequel.AWIL is a classic.but this movie is about as far from being a classic as you can get.what a joke.special effects that aren't very special horrible dialogue non acting.and a laughably ridiculous subplot quickly and unconvincingly (not to mention fleeting)tacked on with about a third of the movie left.did i mention the story is less then lame.there's no way this was supposed to be serious horror movie yet it's to stupid to be funny in any good way.the rating it currently has(4.8/10)is too generous if you ask me.my rating for An American Werewolf in Paris:a 3.5/10,negative
Hello people <br /><br />I cannot believe that Shades from That Thing You Do took this role. I don't think Cory Feldman would have taken this role. This movie was a fuming pile of dung. Save your money and time  and see every one of the top 250. I swear I wanted to slap the lady at Blockbuster silly for permitting me to rent this. Stay away!!!!!!<br /><br />Mr. Hipp,negative
One of two movies I have actually thought about asking for money to stay until the end. Most movies have at least one thing that is worth staying for  even if it just to laugh at how bad it is. I never found it for this movie. Nothing was good  from the script  to the very bad effects. The worst movie I have ever seen.,negative
I just don't get it. Why call this a sequel to the film American Werewolf when it has absolutely NO connection with it whatsoever? The first film was funny *and* scary with ground breaking special effects. (If memory serves  the Oscar category for special make-up effects was *created* for this movie). Paris is none of these things. Awful effects  and not much else. Do not see this movie. Rent the original Werewolf in London instead. You'll be much happier.,negative
Take an utterly stupid story. Couple it with unprofessional performances  2 bit graphics  add ultra-lame comedy bits  and you get this film. I thought the original was bad  but at least that story was simple and straightforward  though idiotic. May nobody produce another in this series.,negative
AWiP tries to be funny  scary  tense  and romantic ... and fails in every respect. The acting is average at best  but mostly stupid. The special effects are not enough to make up for the stupid plot devices  and the chemistry between *ANY* character is juvenile.<br /><br />If you don't want to be mad at yourself  don't pay money to see it.,negative
I had been wanting to see An American Werewolf in Paris for a long time because I loved its predecessor  but this film didn't impress me as much as An American Werewolf in London. Actually  to be quite honest  it didn't impress me at all.<br /><br />Tom Everett-Scott and his dude pals are wandering Paris and  in a preposterous bungee stunt off the Eifel Tower  rescuing wolf-babe Julie Delpy from death. Before you've time to work out if the constant mugging and lumpy dialogue is meant to be the stuff of comedy  a full-moon has hit and the brats are being chased by dreadful CGI werewolves down Parisian sewers.<br /><br />The script is disgustingly poor  the actors were made to make this film  they're horrible performances match the status of the movie. From start to end  this movie is never entertaining  engaging or even slightly watchable. I had trouble watching this whole film without throwing up my dinner  to be quite honest.<br /><br />The action scenes aren't exciting  the jokes aren't funny and the werewolves aren't scary. In short: Miss out or be haunted forever.<br /><br />I rate An American Werewolf in Paris 2 out of 10.,negative
Well  what can be said about a horror comedy that features neither horror nor comedy? There are no characters in the film  but much too many plot lines - all underdeveloped and mostly superfluous.<br /><br />The computer generated creatures look bad  a bit like Disney versions of oversized rats without a tail. The walking dead are the biggest rip-off apart from the title  the shall look like the dead in Landis' movie  but are far removed. They just look like bad actors with abit of plastic and bull's blood added.<br /><br />Two plot lines really showed some promise (the love story and the company story)  but failed as miserably as the director  the writers  the SFX department  the production and the actors.,negative
This DVD is missing its calling as a Heineken coaster.... This is a great example of why no one should ever go see a sequel with a different director/writer than the original. Two hours of this turkey left me begging for Exorcist 2 reruns. <br /><br />NO legitimate laughs. NOT ONE decent scare. The script was just a mess and I felt bad for the actors who had to perform it (they must have had sick relatives at home or monster coke habits or something).<br /><br />The original was a makeup effects landmark. So naturally  the producers of the sequel thought it would be a great idea to to scrap makeup FX and do CG werewolves instead. These CG werewolves had me laughing a lot harder than any of the comedy. It was just a total miss. If ya want a night's entertainment  go rent the original again. Or go take a film class and make your own horror film. You're bound to do better than these fools did.,negative
The odd mixture of comedy and horror sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Had the main male character been a little more interesting  the film would have been as well. A trio of young Americans visit Paris  run into a beautiful werewolf  and the problems confound from there.<br /><br />Numerous logic holes make the possibly intriguing story difficult to take.,negative
I was a fan of the AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON movie and so was curious whether a 16-year later sequel could be done with French language and local re-cast major  supporting  and minor characters. Tonight I watched the edited for FOX Network version that was some sort of curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequels. The screenwriters and directors pay homage to certain of the key plot concepts: Tourist gets wolf bite  full moon comes out  boy meets girl  boy becomes beast  boy dies heroic death after help from ghost victim. For me  the oddest aspect of this formula teen horror special effect-ride was the casting of the school teacher-love interest of the TV comedy ED as one of the werewolf's clueless victims who is more or less totally unsympathetic in the scripted lines they handed her. I haven't seen another horror-flick that this movie is sequelling (a vampire fighting flick titled BLADE)  but I guess that parts of its plotline must explain how villain werewolves (they're spoofish) are threatening the good werewolf pair during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in a Paris subway train  a la SPEED. This 1997 studio product is an odd hybrid of a film since considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes but the authentic terrors of the original have been completely undermined  in my opinion. Such an odd re-write of the werewolf legend and movie-mythology !?! My suggestion to those considering this at the video store -- go for a classic top of the line Thriller instead : Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!,negative
Perhaps I'm being too generous when I give this film two and a half stars out of five  but there was an occasional moment. However  as An American Werewolf movie this one is a missed chance! There are no real plot connections to the superior original to speak of  but the story is similar in some ways to London.<br /><br />*Possible Spoiler Warning* American kids go to foreign country  one falls in love with a beautiful girl. Another one of the kids gets slaughtered by a werewolf in the same night that one gets bitten  and despite his undead friend's warnings  by the light of the full moon he sprouts fur  fangs  and claws!<br /><br />But there are some differences in the story  for one; the girl is one of the werewolves. Second; there are three American Kids. And third; there's some weird-@$$ werewolf cult intent on taking over the world! As crazy as it sounds  that last one  WASN'T a joke! *Spoiler Ends*<br /><br />The films suffers from many things  first the weak acting drags it down immensely! Tom Everret Scott's performance is amatuerish at best  and he and Julie Delpy  who plays his love interest  don't seem to have any chemistry together at all. Second; A weak script that seems to be all over the place. Many elements of suspense and dark comedy  that made the original one great  are missing in this one. And whoever said that eating out the heart of the werewolf that bit you will change you back human? Last I heard this wasn't part of werewolf lore at all! Third; terrible special effects; The werewolf effects are done with computer animation  which works for things such as dinosaurs  ghosts  and space ships. But seems choppy  fake and artificial  when used for furry creatures like werewolves.<br /><br />However there were a few things that saved this one from total turkeydom  there's one hilarious scene in a Paris cafe when Andy (Scott) is having coffee with Serafine (Delpy)  he drops a bunch of condoms on the table  and tries to pass them off as chewing gum  by chewing and blowing a bubble! Also; the soundtrack  a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs have the word moon in their title  like the original movie  the soundtrack is great nontheless. And another funny scene when a rotting corpse  played by Julie Bowen  attempts to whistle and her eyeball pops out  had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />But as a whole this film seems to lack the wit and suspense of the original. And the overly contrived ending doesn't help it out much either.<br /><br />**1/2 Two and a half Out of Five Stars (Average.),negative
God  that sucked. You can't end a horror movie with a happily-ever-after family setting. Yeash. I was kind of ambivalent going in to the final act. But  my god. He didn't have to kill the girl  she didn't die  the ghost father appears with a cure (which makes no sense  because his spirit would have been liberated after the yank kid killed all the bad werewolves). What a hunk of junk. This is the worst horror movie I've seen in a long time  and I've watched a lot of horror movies. This is a slap in the face for Landis and everyone else involved in American Werewolf in London. Blegh. I hope that this ruined the career of every one in it bar Julie Delphy. And CGI: Kind of new and chic back in 1997  but today it just looks drab compared to the artful prosthetic/makeup work of London. Anyway  I'm done  I hope I've scared a few people of. Get the original instead  or failing that The Howling. Or failing that watch American Idol reruns. Just don't watch this mess.,negative
A rather lame teen slasher from Brisbane. While the plot hinges on a fairly decent idea  the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden. The problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown  but if they were that devil-may-care  it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable  so they end up being neither really. In fact  I only started enjoying the film when I started wishing for their death. One of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. I realise we wouldn't have a movie if they did  but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldn't. Avoid.,negative
Once upon a time there was a great American film. Which combined horror and comedy with equal thrills. This film featured clever direction. Groundbreaking special effects and superb comedic and serious acting. It was entitled 'An American Werewolf in London.' Sixteen years later the long awaited sequel was finally pinned onto the poster board outside your local theater. Surely it would have at least some of the thrills of the original. Think again. 'An American Werewolf in Paris' is an incomprehensible mess from start to pitiful finish. The problems begin with the leading man. Tom Everett Scott's performance is stiff and tiresome. From the outset he seems intent on proving that all young people are simpletons. In his defense  not even a seasoned Shakespearean thespian could have extracted a good performance from the juvenile and witless dialogue. At one point  one of Scott's deceased friends  who's soul is doomed to walk the Earth after being carved up by one of the werewolves  Is finally able to leave for the afterlife. He then quips to Scott and his friends. 'Okay guys  see ya.' What a memorable goodbye. Julie Delphy soon shows up as Scott's mysterious European love interest. Basically  she's a French girl playing the French girl. It isn't much of a stretch. But all this stupidity isn't even the most disappointing thing about the film. The special effects  such an integral part of the superb original film  fall far short in this flop. The werewolves look like cartoons. And no matter how well you sculpt a cartoon with sinewy lycanthrope muscles. It's still hard to get scared of a cartoon. So instead the vacationing American gang  led by the ultra weak Scott  keep finding excuses to return to the werewolf's catacombs lair. Here it's much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep the computer enhanced creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness. Some have said that if you don't look on this film as a sequel it's not as bad by comparison. I disagree  this film can not stand on its own  and is even more of a disgrace when compared to the brilliant original. If it doesn't want to be looked on as a sequel it should not have borrowed most of the title from the 1981 film. I   don't care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you worshiped 'American Werewolf in London.' as I myself did. This one is simply not worth wasting your time. 'Okay guys  see ya.' Terrible. 3 out of a possible 10 T.H.,negative
Woeful and unnecessary sequel to a bonafide classic. An American Werewolf in London was  indisputably  a gem of a movie: humorous  demented  with just a dash of romance and so very  very British it made me want to stand up and sing God Save the Queen every time the movie ended. Then came this abomination. You know you are in real trouble when the leads are so utterly unlikeable you are glad when they are slaughtered  and actually start cheering for the lycanthropes. Tell you the truth  folks  I only got about half way through this CGIed travesty before losing the will to live and turning it off. Absolutely pitiful and a putrid waste of anyone's time.,negative
I can't honestly believe that this is a sequel or follow up of John Landis classic comedy horror movie from 1981 . I suppose you can't really describe it as an original werewolf movie either since the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one set in London: An American tourist visits a famous European capital   he narrowly survives a werewolf attack that kills a colleague   he embarks ( Pardon the pun ) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession   he turns into a werewolf   he's visited by apparitions of his dead victims   etc etc . and reading the previous line I've just discovered how much the storyline has in common with the original that it seems very similar indeed . The difference lies in how enjoyable and entertaining the Landis movie is <br /><br />With this Paris based movie there's no scenes that really stand out . There's no naked man waking up in a zoo wondering how he's going to get back home with no money or clothes   there's no bizarre dream sequence of Naziwerewolves and there's no spectacular climax . AAWIP does try to be funny but is there anything more embarrassing than failed humour ? I'm thinking of the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone he's got chewing gum in his pocket and not condoms ! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two movies is that there's no poignancy involved with this dubious follow up . You really do feel sorry for the protagonist's fate and dilemma in the London movie   here you just feel Andy is nothing more than a cypher going through the literary motions of a script . There's also a large number of plot holes visible . Is this the first time The Lunar Club have carried out a massacre ? If not then aren't large numbers of corpses with their hearts torn out been reported in the world's press ? Why haven't the police got leads ?<br /><br />Everyone else has mentioned it and so will I - The visuals are poor . Look at the bungee jumping scene at The Eifell Tower   it's painfully obvious that it's achieved via some blue screen projection while the werewolf transformation is done by some very cartoonish CGI . I won't put Anthony Waller in the same bracket as Stephen Sommers as a director who totally ruins a movie because of an over reliance on CGI ( The major problem with AAWIP is the screenplay coupled with a high degree of expectation from those who saw the 1981 movie classic ) but I would have preferred the Rick Baker type special effects used for the transformation . To be fair it's reasonable to speculate that perhaps the budget didn't stretch that far . But at the end of the day this is a fairly poor horror movie that didn't need to be made and DOG SOLDIERS is much better entertainment,negative
"Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: a complete suckhole  in every way possible. He laughs at all his guests jokes  he asks the most boring questions and he would never dare contradict them. He hits me as the type of person who wants to be liked by...everyone. Friendly  boring  ol'predictable Harry. He probably owes his success to being a dream interviewer for celebrities because they don't get bombarded with what we  the people  want to know and have a right to know. Let's put it this way: he interviews as if he's in a red country. 02/10  2 for the guests that come on the show yet it all seems pointless when Larry starts asking his mind numbing questions such as What's it like to be a mother? followed by the usual answer along the lines of Being a mother is the greatest thing that ever happened to me: it's wonderful, but tiring.",negative
Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States  of which he is a staunch member. King used to be somewhat fair and unbiased and had a variety of guests on. The Party used to be centrist  too  but that was another era. Now  like  Larry  it's Far Left. <br /><br />At least 90 percent of all the guests on King's show in the past year or two are Liberals who sit there and bash President Bush and every Conservative they can think of.....night after night. Bill Mahar  one of the more viscous ones  is - and you can look this up - the most frequent guest in the history of King's TV show. You can count on other outspoken Left Wingers to be on King's show each week  but don't hold your breath waiting for a Conservative. They are few and far between.<br /><br />King was also one of the innovators of the media overkill. That all began with the O.J. Simpson trial. Night after night after night that's all you ever saw back in the mid '90s. Whatever latest gossip on Anna Nicole Smith  or the Petersen murder case  or Paris Hilton  Britney Spears or some other tabloid subject  you can bet Larry will beat it to death. Sadly  all the other networks do the same thing now. Larry was a leader in that regard.<br /><br />King also has the nerve to sometimes give advice  such as on marriage. I am not kidding; I 've heard him say it. The joke is that he has been married and divorced a half dozen times! This man has few scruples  believe me. When it comes to morality  he is clueless. Maybe that's why he has Dr. Phil on  to explain some facts of life to him regularly. Larry will nod  but he doesn't understand any more than when Billy Graham used to talk to him.<br /><br />King also is becoming famous for the softball interview  meaning he asks no hard questions. That is a lot due to the fact that most his guests are of his political persuasion. People know being on King's show is liking having an hour public relations gig.<br /><br />What all this has meant is a serious decline in ratings the past five years. People see through him and his Liberal-and-tabloid-TV mentality and switched over from King and CNN to Fox News.,negative
Alas  another Costner movie that was an hour too long. Credible performances  but the script had no where to go and was in no hurry to get there. First we are offered an unrelated string of events few of which further the story. Will the script center on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? How about Fischer and Thomas? In the end  no real front story ever develops and the characters themselves are artificially propped up by monologues from third parties. The singer explains Randall  Randall explains Fischer  on and on. Finally  long after you don't care anymore  you will learn something about the script meetings. Three endings were no doubt proffered and no one could make a decision. The end result? All three were used  one  after another  after another. If you can hang in past the 100th yawn  you'll be able to pick them out. Despite the transparent attempt to gain points with a dedication to the Coast Guard  this one should have washed out the very first day.,negative
Every time I watch Larry King Live  he rolls out the most softball questions for his guests. He rarely gets any useful information because he doesn't ask the hard questions. This comes from his start on radio.<br /><br />King established himself on the radio and basically has not changed one bit of the format for television except for his talking head being visible. He becomes like a puppy for his guests & the only time he really gets useful information from them is whee they volunteer it or a caller to the show actually asks a hard question.<br /><br />Larry is a nice  fatherly type of interviewer. This means he should not have a prime time show on a major news network if you consider CNN one. I don't because of the history of CNN.<br /><br />Copying (ie. Cable) New Network was started by Ted Turner as an alternative to network news in that it could broadcast news 24/7. When it first started  the only TV competition was from NBC ABC  & CBS. Because of this  CNN Copied the format of their competition & achieved respectable ratings. <br /><br />This worked fine for CNN until they got competing networks which were innovative & provided better/ fresher news coverage. In response to the heating up of competition  CNN went into denial & panned its competitors who were eating their lunch & ratings because CNN wanted to resist change. This didn't work very long & their ratings began to plummet.<br /><br />Now the Copying News Network is trying to re mold itself by re-inventing itself by copying the leading news network format. Unfortunately  this show represents a big piece of the problem. It is 21 years old & showing it's age very badly. <br /><br />Sorry to say  King needs to be moved out of Prime Time or scrapped altogether.,negative
To be fair  I didn't see a lot of this show. Probably because it wasn't as good as the original M*A*S*H  but I seem to recall them moving it around on the weekly schedule. Some shows just aren't worth the trouble of following around every week. But I really did try at first  so it wasn't all bad. Maybe I just kept expecting it to improve  but I can't give this show a 1. In all honesty  I can't give it any more than a 2 either.<br /><br />It wasn't MASH (I'm not going to type those stupid *'s every time). And it was trying to be MASH without putting forth any effort  like it would just magically happen. Well guess what? No magic. The best I can do here is to compare it to other shows.<br /><br />Trapper John  M.D. was a much better show by far. However  they should have called it B.J. Hunnicut  M.D. because Pernell Roberts looked exactly like an older BJ  but nothing at all like Trapper John. Keep everything else the same  just change his name and the name of the show. Presto! After MASH wasn't the only sequel to completely bomb and dishonor the original. Archie Bunker's Place was a lame follow-up to All In The Family. It had no heart  no conflict  no depth  all of the things that made All In the Family so memorable. Likewise  MASH was funny because the doctors were reacting to the impossible absurdity of war. Remove the war and you remove the drive for 99% of the humor. Potter can't yell at Klinger for wearing a dress  because Klinger isn't wearing a dress  because he's not trying to get kicked out of the Army  because he's already out of the Army  because the war is over. (breathe) All of the jokes became forced because there was no motivation for anything. The least motivated was the viewer  to stay around and watch the show.<br /><br />And from what I remember  the whole show seemed to be Potter  Klinger  and Mulcahy just standing there unnaturally  facing the audience like a trio of Vaudeville performers. It was reminiscent of Good Times  where they spent 90% of the show standing behind that couch and talking to the audience  trying to make it look like they were having natural conversation. They weren't. And it felt even less natural on After MASH.<br /><br />Another random tidbit I recall is that the people who made MASH never got any royalties from the spin-off. The studio used the absurd excuse that After MASH was really a spin-off of the movie MASH (which they owned) and not the TV series. Nice try  but Mulcahy was the only one of the three in the movie  and he was never deaf. I guess studio execs will do anything for a buck. Anything other than make a worthwhile sequel  that is.,negative
Rose  Does anything actually happen in this episode? It introduces our two leads  a slow-witted grinning idiot of a Doctor and an utterly un-interesting companion. There's no plot to speak of  childish humour  mixed with some extremely bad pacing and incidental music. What else is there to say  really?<br /><br />The End of the World  A marginal improvement  in that we see our first outer-space scenario. Subsequently brought down by poor contemporary humour  paper-thin logic  very poor pacing  and tired SF clichés.<br /><br />The Unquiet Dead  Best episode to date showing what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode  write interesting character dialogue  AND integrate an intriguing plot. Let down solely by the Doctor and Rose.<br /><br />Aliens of London/World War Three - Doctor who degenerates into farce. What more can be said. Penelope Wilton brings the proceedings a little gravity  trying her best in dire circumstances. Some poorly written  and out-of-place soap opera elements come to the fore in these two episodes  and a return to poor pacing  bad plotting and cringe worthy humour/satire.<br /><br />Dalek  Not great  however still far above the RTD fare to date. The pacing and script are all fine (though the Doctor and Rose still irritate). The effects and menace of the Dalek are introduced well. The finale  however  took an interesting premise that reduced the Doctor's most notorious foe  into a cuddly touchy-feely mess  and turning a previously un-seen menace  to a blue rubber squid that looked like a child's toy.<br /><br />The Long Game - The first RTD script to show any plot  even if it was in a clichéd 80s style. Still  it was marred somewhat by his usual over-reliance on juvenile jokes  placing it too far in the future to make logical sense  and again poor pacing. Not as bad as his previous efforts  but instantly forgettable.<br /><br />Father's Day  The initial premise could've been vaguely interesting  but common sense and logic abandon this episode from the very beginning. Also  we are treated to a whole episode of Soap Opera. Before you start thinking this is all about characterization  remember  there's a big difference between lame Soap Opera and characterization. On the plus side  it does prove RTD isn't the worst script writer so far.<br /><br />The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances - This started off in a mediocre way  with some cringe worthy moments  and some illogical mistakes that even a primary school pupil wouldn't make (Well lit windows in a blackout  anyone?). After this  the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn. Florence Hoath truly steals these episodes  showing us what an interesting companion could've been like. She could also act. Instead we get the annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as the new companion. The conclusion was a little hasty  but sufficient. The pacing and script improved with a reasonably good storyline  making these two episodes quite atmospheric and intriguing. <br /><br />Boom Town - I have to be honest  except for a few examples  I had been so disillusioned by the current series  that upon seeing the trailer for another 'Slitheen' episode  I gave up and didn't subject myself to the torture.<br /><br />Bad Wolf - Reality TV  arguably the worst facet of the modern media  is basically used as the premise. There's no subtlety whatsoever. Do we get any interesting social commentary as in the likes of The Running Man or Truman Show? No  of course not. This in an RTD episode  so they're basically here to cynically try and pull in the audience of said shows. Once again  logic goes out the window  as we're placed 200 000-something years in the future. RTD tries pointlessly to shoe-horn in some 'over-arcing' story here  with no relevance other than it's own existence and when the villains are revealed at the end... They make empty threats  and the Doctor grins once more like an idiot for the climax! Faster paced for the most part  than RTD's other efforts  this has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise  another lacklustre instalment.<br /><br />The Parting of the Ways - The big finale. More of a damp squid  literally. All of the Dalek menace set up in 'Dalek' is brought crashing down  as they become rather pathetic. So many plot holes riddle this episode  with typically poor contrivances. Daleks want to harvest humans as Daleks  but then vaporize entire continents? Dalek's can vaporize said continents  but not destroy the Tardis in space? The Tardis is now indestructible and can land anywhere  even over people so they can be saved in it? This ability can't be used to easily destroy the Dalek 'god'? The Daleks can vaporize entire continents  but don't just nuke satellite 5 to destroy the doctor  and instead let him play around? The doctor is a pathetic coward without the conviction of his actions  after eradicating his whole species to try and eliminate the Daleks? These and many other holes aside  we are treated to the lamest dues ex machina solution ever conceived  joined with a near pointless story arc.<br /><br />So what can we say about the new series  all-in-all?<br /><br />Would this have gained a second series if it were anything other than Doctor Who  with RTD behind it? Would most of the episodes have been seen as anything other than un-original and forgettable  if they were anything other than Doctor Who  and had RTD's name attached? I think not.<br /><br />Some people would have us think we can't say anything against RTD  since we owe him for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens. However  this at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally  I'd rather not have a poorly planned  ill conceived product  churned out at that price. I'd rather wait till someone could come along and make a genuine effort. For the most part  this is the kind of puerile rubbish that gives SF a bad name  marring what is otherwise the most creative genre.,negative
This was a decent movie for the first half. Too many cheap BOO! moments but the tension builds  the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely. The kids are not particularly deep but hey  that works for teens. <br /><br />Then it just gets ridiculous and tries way too hard- the why in the world would he/they do that? moments overwhelm anyone's capacity for suspension of disbelief  the twist involves too many ridiculous coincidences  and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some meaning into the film that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped. There was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be funny. <br /><br />Great premise but just badly written and doesn't hold together. Some very nice shots but they're hard to enjoy while you're rolling your eyes.,negative
I a huge fan of when it comes to Doctor Who series and still am  But I was very disappointed when i began to watch this new series.<br /><br />Children under the age of 15  or even better under the age of 10 will probably will enjoy it the best  and possibly new fans who haven't seen any of the original series  But as far as fans of the original series  will find this series missing much of the charm the made the original series so great  It took David Tennant to get me to Appreciate how Much better Christoper Eccellestion was as a Doctor in the 1st season.<br /><br />I would only recommend this series for people who haven't seen much of the original series  people who are under 15  and EXTREMELY DIE HARD who fans  everyone else will just get a laugh and mumble curse words about Russel T. Davies screwed up one of our favorite TV shows.,negative
"From the weeks and weeks of promotion for this  ABC's The One was supposed to be The Real World meets American Idol. We were to watch these singers perform  compete and see how they lived together in a house as well. The Drama! The Tension! <br /><br />Where does one begin with this atrocity? Let's start with the judges who were known as Music Experts on this program. Experts implies they have expertise. Andre Harrell at least had a pedigree. He was in charge of Motown Records for a time. The other two... eh. Kate Hudson's uncle  who could have been labeled Mr. Weird Beard. He dyed his facial hair three distinctly different florescent colors. I wonder how scary he would have been with a black light! And The Paula Abdul wannabe  who did something I didn't think could happen: she was even more gushing and cloying than Paula! She then over corrected and became harshly critical after the first episode. The farce of critiques that these three offered was a true joke and an insult  not only to the process of finding the best singer  but to the audience that is now quite savvy  already having done this numerous times on Fox.<br /><br />There was the host. George Stroumboulopoulos was no Ryan Seacrest. In fact  he was as lackluster as can be. He actually sucked what little energy there was in the program  dry. How he got that job was the second biggest mystery of the show.<br /><br />The first was how did they pick the 11 competitors for this program? This was literally a talent-free talent show. OK. Perhaps that's an exaggeration. And granted  the performers all have to be relatively close in ability  because if they were not  there wouldn't be a contest. If only one person was good, there would be no suspense. So  I get that they all needed to be comparable. But they all should have had *some* chops! Additionally  the judges were running a Singing Academy, so the program was part Fame, as well. Clearly these performers desperately needed those lessons. But you need some extremely talented people to teach those with little talent to be talented. And that definitely wasn't what was happening here.<br /><br />It seemed in casting the show  the priority was on the homelife elements  as all of the players were very attractive to look at  in equal parts to how badly they vocalized. But the filmed segments in their house were so chopped and sliced  you couldn't get into the stories that were starting to happen  so the show didn't capture the events there  either.<br /><br />As badly devised as all of that was  The One had an incredible  unbelievable  fatal design flaw built into the results that made it completely laughable.<br /><br />The audience phoned in their votes for who they liked the best  just like on AI. But then  after the audience vote was revealed  the bottom three contestants were forced to sing a final song. The music experts, based on that performance  chose one person from the three to save for the following week. And THEN  the contestants who were safe got to vote for who they wanted to keep from the remaining two  sending the remaining contestant home.<br /><br />The design flaw was that the contestants had the final say. I mean  if you were in a music competition and you wanted to get as far along the path as you could  would you vote to KEEP the better singer  or would you try to get rid of your toughest rival? Any first season viewer of CBS's Survivor could answer that one! And that's exactly what happened on the program. The person who had the better potential was lost  and the contestants voted back the one who had no talent at all! On top of that  the contestant who was just saved from the bottom by the experts was also allowed to vote against the remaining two! It was a complete farce! <br /><br />Maybe if they let the contestants vote first  at least the experts would save the better of two evils to finish. But this just confirms how not ready this show was for broadcast  how unsatisfying the whole process was to view and how misguided the producers were in attempting it.",negative
No surprise except in how quickly ABC reacted to the dismal ratings. According to published reports (Variety) the show garnered the worst ratings in the history of the ABC television network.<br /><br />And I quote: ABC's music talent competition The One opened Tuesday night to cancel-me-now ratings.<br /><br />The article went on to say that the show received a shockingly low 1.1 rating/3 share in adult 18-49 and 3.08 million viewers overall.<br /><br />That makes it the weakest premiere for any reality show on any network and also below all series bows in ABC history.<br /><br />From the first moment I saw the commercials for this I knew it would fail. We don't need another American Idol clone. But ABC should have given this show a fair chance to succeed.,negative
The One is a very aptly name show  mostly because it comes close to being the only network shows on in prime time that barely more than one person is watching.<br /><br />When I first heard of The One  I thought to myself Weee!! Another sing-song show! We don't have enough of those! and then proceeded to strap on my helmet and run about my home hitting my head on blunt objects and sharp corners. Because in all honesty  the constant  year round pain and suffering inflicted by having only one or two talent based reality shows running just isn't enough. We needed another one. And not just any one - THE One. The one with slightly less attractive contestants with slightly less talent. The one with slightly less of a point  though it's hard to imagine a scenario in which that's possible. The one with pointless footage of the contestants when they're not performing included. Because I care what Johnny Sings-a-lot does in his off hours! I really do! Now  you may be thinking Hey! On the entire continent of North America less than 4 million people watched the first episode. Doesn't that mean this show sucks? Well  to that I say less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis  so sometimes low numbers bring good news now don't they?. Think about it.<br /><br />In the end  The One may be horribly unoriginal  a show that even the airing network couldn't be bothered to promote because they too realize how absolutely worthless it is  but it's still not syphilis! Yay!,negative
Poor second-string feature from Universal Pictures about a mama's boy movie actor doing criminal investigation work for the military  fending off the advances of the brash young woman he's been assigned to romance. Robert Montgomery directed and stars in this adaptation of the short story Come Be My Love  and his acting performances of this era are unrelievedly lazy. The plot is sappy  predictable stuff  and writer Robert Carson has given all the really funny lines (as usual for films of this period) to the feisty black maid. It's always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl in support  but they can't do much with this hokey material. * from ****,negative
After the turning point of NIGHT MUST FALL  Robert Montgomery (for the most time) came into his finest films and performances: HERE COMES MR. JORDAN  THEY WERE EXPENDABLE  THE LADY IN THE LAKE  RIDE THE PINK HORSE  THE SAXON CHARM  JUNE BRIDE. Even some of the failures he was in were interesting enough to be still watchable (RAGE IN HEAVEN  MR. AND MRS. SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and directing work. In 1949 he made what would be his last movie performance - he played Collier Lang  an egotistical movie star  who is dragged into helping the authorities do an investigation about a young girl's boyfriend.<br /><br />Apparently my view of this film is a minority view. Most of the views given are favorable about it. I thought it was a dull  witless script  with Ann Blyth's groupie heroine not very appealing as a character. She admires Montgomery as a star  and this helps when he is called in to assist the authorities  but after awhile I found there was no chemistry between them. The script was also devoid of much fun  although Montgomery and Roland Winters did try. The only thing I recall to this day as a joke point was that Taylor Holmes is the wealthy father of Blyth  and he is an admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always dresses up as Churchill  and we see him wearing a floppy broad brimmed hat  smoking a large cigar  and painting (Holmes' bald head helps in the disguise). That was the most memorable joke from this film - not much of a real memory.<br /><br />Montgomery went into early television  and finally won the attention and respect he always had deserved in motion pictures. His last contact with the movies was his direction of THE GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William Bull Halsey  starring his friend Jimmy Cagney. It is a far better film than this. For his overall film and television career  I will give this mediocre film a 4. That strikes me as generous.,negative
Less than two hundred and fifty years ago  the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history. This is the story of a buccaneer Captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants from the ports of the Caribbean to the trading houses of London.....<br /><br />Hmm  that opening to the film sounds like we are in for one hell of a swashbuckling  pillaging  ripper of a movie doesn't it? Well it's not. Tho it's not totally without value as a curio piece. Out of 20th Century Fox  Anne Of The Indies is adapted by Philip Dunne & Arthur Caesar from a short story written by Herbert Ravenel Sass. Direction is by Jacques Tourneur  the score is by Franz Waxman and Harry Jackson is providing the Technicolor photography. Jean Peters is in the titular title role of Anne {AKA Captain Providence} and support comes from Louis Jourdan  Debra Paget  Herbert Marshall  Thomas Gomez & James Robertson Justice.<br /><br />Originally meant to be be based on true life pirate Anne Bonny  the film ultimately turns out to be a tale of a woman seeking identity  and finding herself  in the predominantly male led world of piracy and sea based shenanigans. Filled with clichés and over familiar set pieces  the film also suffers from a cast that is largely misfiring. Peters gives it a right good go  and Paget lights up the screen with effervescent beauty. While Robertson Justice  although underused  actually looks the part and doesn't overact like the rest of the male cast does. Some reviewers have desperately tried to dig deep into the film to find intelligence and hidden meanings  purely because it's Tourneur in the directing chair. But there is no depth here  this is merely a job for Tourneur  a professional one granted  but its thinly plotted and actually lacking swash to go with the buckle in the action stakes. <br /><br />Disposable at best. 4/10,negative
Alien was excellent. Many writers tried to copy it. They all did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst Alien copy. Because of the bad actors  the bad special effects  the BAD scenario and other bad stuff (it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that is bad in this film. The movie wasn't very long and this is a very good thing (the only one). You cannot laugh because it is too serious...that is a bad thing because  in almost each B-series sci-fi film  you can laugh during the whole time. It can be terrific sometimes  but instead of watching this stupidity  just watch Alien or Event Horizon...these are much better!!! I give it 1 out of 5.,negative
I am the kind of person who can enjoy a good B Movie if it has some kind of redeeming value to it  but Dead Space has nothing to redeem it! This is the kind of film that will make you frustrated  restless and sick to your stomach. <br /><br />Bad acting. Lame story. Terrible effects. Horrible  excruciating dialogue. Dead Space has it all!,negative
The filmmakers apparently had enough money to be able to afford decent makeup effects  but not enough for a creature that would move around and attack convincingly. We never get a chance to see the monster move from one place to another - whenever that happens (supposedly)  the camera focuses on the terrified reactions of the humans that are nearby. And when a man is attacked by it  he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself so that it won't fall to the ground. This is still not the worst Alien rip-off around (the two Xtro films are even worse  for example); it's actually sufficiently entertaining if you've got 68 (!!) minutes to spare. (*1/2),negative
Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in screaming teen cliché horror with a more thriller-like pacing. In some ways Acolytes is very successful  but in many other ways the film fails miserably.<br /><br />Overall Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever  Texas Chainsaw Massacre  and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers  have sex  run around screaming and one-by-one are plucked off by some sort of monster. Instead this innocence is replaced with pride  retaliation  and arrogance. The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair  but failed to do so due to their own personal demons. In the end you were left with the feeling that there were no (and perhaps are no) innocent victims.<br /><br />As the name implies  the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority. This was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film. Following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the film.<br /><br />Through all this  the film makers also incorporated a lot of cliché  which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which I found intriguing. This  perhaps inadvertently  plays well with the characters who are  at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are  at least the two main male characters  quite complex.<br /><br />Technically the film has a lot of problems however. The cinematography  which is typically regarded highly  I find rather sophomoric and over-stylized  utilizing formulaic 2/3 approaches far too rigidly. Many transitions I felt were also over-stylized. The use of symbolism was not only vague  but also greatly over used.<br /><br />The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending  which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused. Methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and ill-prepared  motivations are routinely unclear  and major plot points remain untied in the end.<br /><br />Overall  the film's relative originality  themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution  over-stylized imagery  unclear motives  obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect information.<br /><br />If the film were better executed  it would have been excellent. However  Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion.,negative
How can anyone even begin to like this film is really beyond me.<br /><br />The idea? It has none. A guy fell apart. That's the idea. Wow. An environment was slowly killing him... now THAT's original and worth watching.<br /><br />This is the first Fasbinder's film I've seen... I've heard that he's a genius of mise-en-scene  but I've seen student films with more attention  inspiration  idea  and craft than this... this.... this nothing. It has nothing!<br /><br />Each and every shot is too long. There's so much emptiness in them... The acting's horrible. You can see the actors had no preparation at all  no understanding of their roles  not even an attempt at showing emotions... it's so... superficial... The lines are so explicative that you could removed 90% of them and still have the same crappy film. Tempo? Who cares about it. Atmosphere  dynamics  that's for pussies! One shot per scene  80% of the time people staring unrealistically  having no idea how to represent emotions and importance of the moment besides hollow staring at the camera or one another... EDiting? All rules of editing have been disregarded with no pa pay-off of any kind... Photography? Half of the shots have reflection in them  and crappy lighting with no stylization of any kind. Shadows  play of shadows... who needs that? We need a guy pissing  drinking  hitting his wife like he's... like he's acting. We need a bunch of close ups of a not-so-beautiful woman... we need an amateurish climax of his capture by an unconvincing arabian torturer... This film has so much wrongs that it isn't worth the no-budget it had.<br /><br />Frankly  I haven't seen a film this bad since American Pie 5. Yup. That bad.<br /><br />I've just started watching his Veronica Foss movie  which seems much better  based on the first 15 minutes (since it does have a hint of directing and artistic idea  unlike this crap)  so I won't argue that Fasbinder's clueless.... but this.... this film SUCKS!,negative
the movie is precious  and cage is a babe. <br /><br />but will anyone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is ATROCIOUS?!?! <br /><br />where's the clash? the ramones?? misfits? social distortion? the cramps?? sex pistols?! ANYONE?!?!?!?! the music is this movie is incredibly disappointing! at LEAST they play the cure.<br /><br />plus  randy's feathered hair and pleated khakis...<br /><br />this definitely looks like a movie about punks the way that a bunch of movie industry squares see punks.<br /><br />although it's a 90's movie  SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980's. just sayin'.,negative
I must say that I wasn't impressed at all  probably because I was expecting much more from this movie. Maybe an accent on religion vs science or on the meaning of life  not just a few lines. So  if you expect something to think about after you see this movie  don't. It's more psychological than philosophical. I vote 4 because of the end  it clears up a bit and because I have a great respect for BBC documentaries. There are a couple of very interesting scenes that actually gave some sense. It was a brilliant idea to add it in a movie related to theory of evolution  too bad that this wasn't the main subject. Ah  I just forgot to say that for more than 1 hour  the movie is quite boring and in a way  cruel.,negative
I had high hopes going to see this  as I always enjoy Paul Bettany's performances. I thought he was very good as Darwin  and did his best considering the terrible material he had to work with.<br /><br />Darwin's book On the Origin of Species was one of the most ground-breaking  controversial and innovative publications ever  yet you'd never think it based on this tedious movie. It's like a two-hour episode of a soap opera in a Victorian setting. There is virtually nothing about Darwin's five-year voyage on The Beagle to the Galapagos Islands  for example  surely of supreme significance to the story  as it was from his investigations of the wildlife thereon that he began to form his theory of evolution.<br /><br />This is just one long  dreary  domestic drama  with Darwin portrayed as a slightly loopy eccentric  seeing visions of his dead daughter everywhere and being given the cold shoulder by his emotionally-constipated wife. Jennifer Connelly's portrayal of Emma Darwin is nothing short of awful and bears little relation to historical descriptions of the real Emma. There could have been an opportunity here to present the creationist interpretation of life on earth  from either Emma or from the local priest  as played by Jeremy Northam (a blink-and-you'd-miss-it part which is a complete waste of a talented actor) to act as a counterbalance to Darwin's views  but it wasn't taken up. <br /><br />The story focused too much on endless mawkish sentiment about Darwin's grief for his daughter Annie  and too much time was also wasted in Darwin wondering whether or not to write his book. Eventually I was so bored it was difficult to care. <br /><br />All in all  this was a bit like making a movie about Picasso and spending two hours concentrating on him having a fight with his girlfriend and not bothering to mention that he was an artist.,negative
I wish I could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theories it espouses. But I can't. Another species could have come and mutated while I waited for some action. For such a controversial man  Darwin lived the most conventional life. If you didn't know about the mad theories  you could almost mistake him for a stamp collector.<br /><br />The film-makers have cast Darwin as a dullard which does him a disservice. Even when he briefly loses his mind due to his tireless theorising  it wasn't interesting to watch. Maybe great thinkers are dull people? I don't know what I was expecting: a forehead-banging eccentric with wild hair and eyes espousing his love of all things simian  the glint of madness straining from a furrowed brow? A long-haired hermit who babbled to animals? A head-cradling lunatic with eyes lit up like beacons of truth? All of the above would have been great. This is the movies for Scorsese's sake.<br /><br />But there was none of that. No lightning  no thunder  no wonder  no awe. Just Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly fresh from the Subtle as Breath School of Method Acting. I imagine that someone with Darwin's ideas had a brain like a speeding train so why did this film just pootle along - chug chug chug - like a slow winter? The disappointment is immeasurable.,negative
what a waste of a film once again the film industry does not trust to make a film that could have been just about the man's ideas. there is virtually nothing on his theories or evolution  instead the most boring story of home life and relationship with one daughter  a ponderous script  great liberties taken with Darwin's life  dialogue given to his character that i find hard to believe he would have voiced. Darwin never gave up his believe in a higher power  he may not quite rightly have believed in the established Christian idea of God   but was not an atheist. which this film implies. what would have been a riveting and much better film  is if they had started with the publication of On the Origin of Species and constructed a story of the great revolution that entailed  and of an amazing cast of characters involved on all sides. instead we got a plodding  boring drama  mostly made up  a great injustice,negative
How to take Charles Darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flick. His pivotal and seminal ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are untouched except for two brief scenes  in one of which it is claimed he is killing God; pure demagoguery to make the movie emotional. And the rest of the movie buckles to that purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overloud music at which one is beholden to cry. Anyone who actually read Origin Of Species would be vividly aware that there was no breach with God in any of Darwin's work; to the contrary  there was an increased awe and respect  and a revolutionary new way of looking at things. A good movie about Darwin could be educational  thoughtful  and deeply inspiring  even in a religious sense - but that would contradict the soap-opera intentions of this flick. This is a flick that is designed to make people wail in contrived sympathy and then feel transformed although unable to understand why; it makes fast use of Darwin's great name only as marketing clout  as one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression. Sad that the sets and costumes are so good: production values  except for the writing  were obviously high. See it if you want to weep  for the loss of intelligence in American literature.,negative
I can remember reading that Darwin had a pivotal experience in the Galapagos islands  seeing the vast range of animal life there  and intern  penned his theory of evolution. Not according to this movie-it was inspired by the British countryside. OK  and as John Cleese would say-Right-. I also did not think that Darwin was a man suffering from deep personal conflict and someone who suffered dark reveries and flights of anguish. According to this film he was. It is sad that he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness  but I don't think him losing a family member would have impacted on the mans scientific abilities very much. Well  not according to...you get the picture. I think there is nothing worse than when science gets turned into fable  and to an extent this film comes off as trying to debunk evolutionary theory by saying it came from a man who was emotionally unstable  which to me  is just plain gross. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific enquiry  cool and calm  and always thinking logically. This film seeks to dramatize the undramatic and sensationalize clear headed scientific exploration. It is like a Canterbury Tale. I would not recommend it.,negative
This could have been a great movie with plenty of educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution  biology  the creative work in science  research and Darwin's life  but it is not.<br /><br />The screenplay is mostly historically inaccurate and transforms a true story into a Mexican soup-opera melodrama. While it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs  this was in great part due to his findings during the voyage of the Beagle and not solely due to the loss of his daughter. He was certainly disturbed by his loss  but that did not made him literally insane  delusional and detached from his friends and family. The such portrayal of Darwin is an invention of the script writer. Thus it cannot be used in any way as place to learn a bit about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians  Darwin had the theory ready by the end of the Beagle voyage  and kept it from going public because he wanted to develop further the consequences of it and check against more data. In the movie  it is an imaginary conflict of Darwin with his religious beliefs and the mental illness that he developed after his daughter's death that kept him from going public.<br /><br />The movie brings a modern situation  the creationists vs scientists debate  into the life and times of Darwin  thus it is anachronistic. It depicts Thomas Huxley not as a man trying to develop further understanding of biology but as someone eager to kill God  in his own words from the movie  and destroy the church  who would accept the theory of evolution for such purposes and not because it was a synthesis of plenty of disconnected data. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensible person  a combination that I interpret was an attempt to ridicule active atheists who speak up against religion. In real life  Huxley accepted Darwin's ideas after publication only gradually  and before the work of Darwin he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first support of evolution was published one month after the Origin of Species became public. He was agnostic but did not think it was necessary to kill God  only thought that there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. The debate creationists vs scientists appears throughout the movie  and creationists catch-phrases such as It is only a theory are part of the discussion. Of course  no such dispute or catch-phrases existed at that time. In fact  the Anglican Church published a positive review of the Origin's saying that they saw God's work in evolution  in some sense  quite in fact in contradiction to the way that the clergy is portrayed in the screenplay.<br /><br />Another awful aspect of this movie is that it gives the wrong impression to the general public that scientific research is done by a solitary crazy man who just writes a lot. Nothing could be further from the truth. The conception of the theory of evolution was the result of thorough observations of living forms by Darwin during five years in the HMS Beagle  and was developed gradually as it can be seen from Darwin's notes of the voyage. Even though the Beagle voyage was the sole most important part of Darwin's life to the conception of Origin of Species  the voyage is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning  and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis of observations. To make it worse  Darwin is shown performing a single experiment (pigeon breeding) to test his theory and  in the end  quits it. And I'm not really sure whether such experiment did actually occur.<br /><br />Great disappointment. It is not in any way a homage to Darwin and science.,negative
Man with the Screaming Brain is a story of greed  betrayal and revenge in the a small Bulgarian town. William Cole  wealthy industrialist  winds up with part of his brain replaced by that of a Russian cab driver Yegor. The two couldn't be more different  but they share one thing - both were killed by the same woman. Brought back to life by a mad scientist  William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis.<br /><br />Bruce Campbell returns to the B horror movie genre that gave him his cult status  this time not only in front of the screen  but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time around  the laughs don't deliver and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try and fill the gap in this film.<br /><br />As a fan of Campbell  who has the movies  the books and the action figures  I was hoping for another hit to add to my collection. Although  after seeing this film before the purchase  I am glad that I don't have the pleasure of adding it.<br /><br />The film first goes wrong in the story  which at first sight  seems like harmless fun but turns out to be boring drawn out dribble. Which is a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. The comedy never really hits  it only makes us scratch our heads. It seems that Campbell ran out of things that are funny and resulted in giving the audience what we've already seen...him fighting himself.<br /><br />Ted Raimi  the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi  is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. He brings a freshness to it and an entertaining time when the film really needs it. It helps if you are a fan and have been following these stooges from Evil Dead to Xena  which is why I felt compelled to like this film.<br /><br />Campbell's experience as a director  from directing episodes of the TV series Hercules is apparent. Campbell makes the film work well enough  even with the low-budget. In the end  there aren't as many things going for this as one would hope for  but the fans of Campbell will stick behind it no matter what  unfortunately for this fan...I won't.,negative
I caught this on IFC last week and I thought it was typical of the indie short subject film: heavy on style  little on substance and originality. Does it comes as any surprise that a coming out film stars an unusually attractive (and blond to boot) boy with 70s shag hair and too-cool-for-school clothes? Plus  this film wallows in late 1970s chic  which works for some (Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides comes to mind) but not for this director.<br /><br />Another reviewer compared this to Harmony Korine's work and I agree. Yet I don't view this as a positive thing (what has HE done lately  anyway?). Bobbycrush is really just a waste of time and energy for all involved. If you happen to see it late night on cable  turn the channel and watch something else instead.,negative
Lets get one thing out of the way. I am a HUGE Bruce Campbell fan  I have the Evil Dead series  have the action figures  and have seen Bubba Ho-Tep. I am a fan of cheesy  laughable horror flicks and know how to appreciate the whole it's so bad it's good deal. <br /><br />I wish I could say the same about this movie. I watched this movie with high expectations  I wanted it to be good  campy  something from the BC we have all come to know and love. It started out promising enough  but after the first 20 minutes I resided to watching the rest of this sorry excuse of a movie as if I had just been shot with tranquilizer darts. <br /><br />The idea itself isn't a bad one; two men  don't get along  both killed by the same psycho woman  half of one man's brain is transplanted into the other's head  they argue  disagree and the comedy ensues. <br /><br />What killed me is how extremely unorganized and boring it was! It had potential  even as a camp flick to be so much better than it was. The plot was boring  even Bruce's zany physical slap stick couldn't make it work. <br /><br />Word's cannot even properly express the ridiculous robot that Bruce's wife's brain ends up getting put into. Easily the worst looking robot I have ever seen anywhere (even for a B movie.) The whole idea is dumb. <br /><br />What the hell was going through Bruce's mind when he made this steaming pile is beyond me. Why Ted Raimi didn't go running to his big brother asking him to slap some sense into Bruce and not to mention some lessons about making an enjoyable movie on a budget is beyond me.<br /><br />Shame on you Bruce!!!,negative
I enjoy B movies. I think Bruce Campbell is a very watchable actor. I love how he delivers his lines. 'Evil Dead 2 and 'Army of Darkness' were great movies. I liked 'Running Time'. However  I don't know if I'll ever watch this movie again...and I bought it. Now  after saying that  I bet the commentary tracks and special features will be worth watching! This movie just has far too many holes for me to actually enjoy  even as a cheapo movie. First off  Ted Raimi was annoying  just flat out annoying. There was nothing to his badly acted / written character that hasn't been done better a thousand times before. The directing sadly was sub par and the choice of some shots...yikes. I don't expect Woody Allen or James Cameron here  but Campbell did not deliver.<br /><br />I did not purchase this thinking it was going to be an Oscar movie like 'Annie Hall'  but still I'm disappointed. I would have been happy with 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhino Brothers'. I got much less. By the end of the movie there were no scenes that popped out to me  no dialogue that resonated within me. Even 'Hostel' had a classic line for petes sake! I do not recommend this movie.,negative
I just saw this movie last night at a midnight sneak preview screening (I work for an independent theatre chain in Colorado - it's one of the perks)...I'm sorry  but this is one of THE WORST movies I've ever seen! I know that there are some Bruce Campbell fanatics out there who (like Star Wars die-hards) will string you up from the nearest tree if you DARE speak any ill of their beloved cinematic icon...nevertheless  Campbell-teers  this particular work from The Chin is a celluloid black hole.<br /><br />Before you make any assumptions that I'm some hoity-toity film buff who only watches real movies like Ladies in Lavender and Sideways  think again - I'm a huge fan of B-movies  and Bruce Campbell in particular. His trademark character Ash is one of my favorites  and his portrayal of the aging Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal.<br /><br />But hey  B-movies still have the potential to be reeeeally  reeeeally bad (and not in that good campy way we all love)...and that's what watching this particular one was like for me and my fellow co-workers. With the exception of that one tracking shot where Bruce runs through the square and scares the kids  there were no laughs to be had. Overall  we found the story to be mind-numbingly stoopid  the pacing mollasses-like  and the so-called humor dumber than a bag of hammers. (I'm sorry  but Ted Raimi's Pavel character was not comic relief...he was just plain retarded!) Believe me  we all went into this really wanting to like it  but left feeling incredibly disappointed and robbed of two hours.<br /><br />If you absolutely loved this movie  plan to see it multiple times  want to marry and have kids with it  etc.  that's fantastic - we all like what we like  so you get no judgement from me. But don't go questioning the sense of humor or fan loyalty of those who aren't having multiple orgasms over Campbell's latest cinematic coupe. This flick was a steaming turd sandwich in my humble opinion...and as a true Campbell fan  I'm allowed to say that!,negative
"Guys  what can I tell you? I'm Bulgarian. I can't remember how many times I talk to Americans and let alone that they don't have a slightest clue where is Bulgaria  but they say things like: There's a war going on there, right? or I've never imagined that in a place like Bulgaria people have Internet Go watch Bruce Campbell's The Man With The Screaming Brain. I was curious about this movie  cause 1) I'm Bruce Campbell fan - Evil Dead trilogy and The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. 2) The movie was shot entirely on location in Bulgaria  the second after Alien Apocalypse which is also nearly unwatchable. 3) I enjoy nice B-movies<br /><br />Well... The movie presents our country like a never-ending Gypsy Town where they raid your car  wave around illegal guns  and you can get killed any moment. And Bruce's line Bull$h1t Bulgaria is more than offending.<br /><br />Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach make a great team  Bruce does his special - beats himself up and that's all. Nothing more to see here.<br /><br />Peoeple give this movie 10 just because of Bruce's cult status  but it doesn't deserve more than 3. Waste of film.",negative
My brain was screaming why do you keep watching! Turn it off and go to bed! But couch potatoness won out  and I watched until the predictable ending. I guess when it's Bruce Campbell I need to give it a chance.<br /><br />I find it hard to complain about a low budget movie purely because of the low budget... time and time again we see low budget movies proving that a good story  good writing and good acting are enough to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce got their start on just such a movie  but they didn't seem to learn from Sam that it takes a bit more than slapping it on film to make a movie.<br /><br />It's sad  too  because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 70's and 80's  I just can't believe movies this bad are still being made. Bruce  I'm really disappointed.,negative
I'm 35. Bruce was THE man in Evil Dead  and I still love to watch ED1 and ED2. It was cool also to see him as The King two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep in which he showed versatility and great acting talent. But this Screaming Brain adventure is certainly not for Bruce's early fans. Either I'm getting too old for this sh17  or I'm just not part of Bruce's target audience anymore. I'm positive kids age 9 to 13 will love this film. But this over extended matinée sci-fi comedy contains about 5 minutes total of interesting moments  and the rest is cheap kids slapstick humor. Campbell better talk seriously with Sam Raimi and get their brains screaming together for a last Evil Dead reunion picture to get back my interest. At least there would be a good director behind the camera... Sorry Bruce  this just doesn't cut it for me. Take care.,negative
Written by  directed by and starring the champ of camp Bruce Campbell. Easy on its easy to tell this is a budget on a shoestring affair; filmed independently in Bulgaria. All I can really say for sure is that silly is not always funny. Campbell plays an affluent American business man with a cheating wife(Antoinette Byron)and trying to close a business transaction before he is murdered. He hires a cabbie to drive him around a strange little town; not knowing that his wife is 'carrying on' with the taxi driver. Within moments of Campbell being bludgeoned; the cabbie is killed in the same location. A mad scientist(Stacy Keach)proceeds with an experiment putting the cabbie's brain inside the American's head. With massive stitches on his forehead  Campbell breaks free and roams the streets looking for his wife; all the while he is arguing with a strange voice inside his over-sized head. Campbell contorts his rubbery face making silly expressions as he argues with himself. Thus  Bruce is doing what he does best and no doubt his many fans will be pleased. I get the impression this must have been written as a straight comedy. Rounding out the cast are Ted Raimi  Tamara Gorski  and Vladmir Kolev. Watch for this on the Sci-Fi Channel.,negative
"As a Bruce Campbell fan for nearly two decades  I was thrilled to have an opportunity to see his latest film on the big screen with the man himself in attendance. Unfortunately  Man with the Screaming Brain was itself a disappointment.<br /><br />Set in Bulgaria--where the Sci-Fi Channel makes its Saturday night original films--Man with the Screaming Brain is a curious mix of '50s B-movie horror  body-switching comedy  violent revenge flick  and overdone slapstick with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If that doesn't make sense  well  neither does Man with the Screaming Brain. Campbell plays a pharmaceutical company CEO who visits Bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in the former Communist country's half-finished subway system. The two fall in with a former KGB agent turned cab driver  and all three ultimately meet their demise at the hands of a vengeful gypsy woman.<br /><br />A local scientist (Stacy Keach) and his goofy assistant (Ted Raimi)  who have developed a technique to allow tissue transplants without the possibility of rejection  steal the bodies and place a portion of the cab driver's brain into Campbell's damaged skull. Also  they put his wife's brain into a robotic body they just happen to have at hand.<br /><br />Campbell escapes  and with a hastily-restitched skull and the voice of the cab driver--whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body--echoing in his head  sets off to find and kill the gypsy. (His robot wife does the same.) <br /><br />But first  there's an attempt to emulate Steve Martin/Lily Tomlin's All of Me when Campbell's two personalities battle for dominance over a restaurant dinner. Just as he was playing his own evil hand in Evil Dead II, Campbell is adept at making his body appear to be inhabited by more than one mind.<br /><br />At times  Screaming comes closest to another Steve Martin film  The Man with Two Brains, as it also takes a silly approach to '50s sci-fi clichés. However  it tries too hard for too little result  and that goes double for Ted Raimi's semi-comprehensible Bulgarian oaf  who gets entirely too much screen time. (Nothing against Raimi  it's just that he's better in smaller doses.) <br /><br />In the end  it's neither outrageous (or funny) enough to satisfy as a spoof  nor is it serious enough to enjoy as a B-movie pastiche. I was glad that Campbell had already left the screening by the time it ground to a halt  as I feared having to say  Gee, Bruce, that was really...something.<br /><br />Perhaps the best praise I can give it as a film is that at least the images stuck to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as Alien Apocalypse.",negative
It's so fake! The plot seems like a generic adaptation of the average blaxploitation film. The common themes of blaxploitation like racism  oppression and fighting for the integrity of your community are outlined so simplistically/shallowly. And the jokes aren't even funny! Dolemite does these stand up monologue comedy routines that are really painful. All the people around him deliver this canned laughter. Even the soundtrack sounds like it's fakin' the funk. For far better comedy in a blaxploitation try Coffy & Friday Foster with Pam Grier. For a more realistic blax experience try Black Heat.,negative
I love the so-called blaxploitation films and have seen dozens. Some  such as COTTON COMES TO HARLEM  SHAFT and HAMMER have excellent production values and are very entertaining  while many others are very cheap and silly  but still entertaining  such as BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH or COFFEY. However  DOLEMITE manages something rare for the genre--it's just cheap and silly and not the least bit entertaining! It's like blaxploitation made for very  very stupid people.<br /><br />Years ago  I saw a takeoff on the Dolemite films on Mad TV and unfortunately  the real DOLEMITE isn't any better. Like the parody  the acting is just atrocious. Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood. He can barely read his lines and his karate is a joke--with his kicks obviously missing the target again and again. As for the rest of the actors  many might be even worse. My favorite was the FBI guy who couldn't even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out--yet they didn't even bother to re-film these scenes! In fact  so much of it was inept that I had a hard time figuring out whether the film was intended as a joke.<br /><br />If you think that despite horrible acting and action that there is something worth seeing about this film  you're wrong. Even for the perverts out there hoping to see some skin  will be disappointed. The naked women in the film really do look like hard-luck prostitutes and there's nothing remotely sexy about their sagging bodies. I think looking at old people naked--REEEAALLY old people naked--is no worse than looking at these ladies. And as for Rudy Ray  he has man boobs. No Black super-hero or anti-hero should look that bad naked!! For goodness sakes  put on your clothes people and come up with a script that doesn't look like it was written by winos!!!<br /><br />FYI--Apparently  there are actually sequels to this film!! I can't imagine watching them  so you'll just have to find someone else to review them. I have watched PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE  TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE and ROBOT MONSTER  but I just don't think I can bring myself to see another Dolemite film--they are that bad!,negative
Dolemite is the touching story of Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation film titles)  an ex-con who probably should still be in jail. He gets in trouble with cops  friends  drug dealers  women  prostitutes  and society in general. He's just not that likable a guy. Neither is the movie  though it's still hilarious and worth watching.<br /><br />The flimsy premise is that Dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as star Rudy Ray Moore can muster) is in jail for a crime he claims he didn't commit. When a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down  the warden releases him to stop it  or help it  or just watch it. Not very clear. All I know is that I was unaware that the justice system frees convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence. My ignorance  I guess.<br /><br />The plot is convoluted and unimportant  basically Dolemite goes around killing people (Usually with very poorly choreographed karate)  having sex  and cursing out people  sometimes even rhyming too. The joys of the movie are its total incompetence  and its total indifference in the matter.<br /><br />I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration (about two minutes of film). I stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where Dolemite was sitting  even after he stood up and walked around  when they cut back to the establishing shot and Dolemite was inexplicably sitting down again. I stopped wondering why Dolemite dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change  because he didn't want to get in his car with the ugly (read: normal) clothes the jail gave him. And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he jiggles his hand on a guy's stomach and somehow cuts him open. The only time I was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting  flabby white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up. You keep saying Cut away...cut away...cut away but by the time they do  you are already emotionally scarred.<br /><br />The movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable. Moore as Dolemite  is either funny  cool  or both. If you're on the lookout for a bad movie  you have found it with Dolemite.,negative
I was subjected to this terrible excuse for a made for TV movie. I only watched it because I don't have cable and my only other choices were Golf  College Basketball  or local news. The plot is very generic and has no substance that I could see  not to mention it had a major flaw in my eyes. The main character  Dr. Sorensen  is a washed up astronomer who believes that an asteroid named Nemesis will strike Earth  causing all life to cease. He bases his belief on his discovery of cave paintings by an Aboriginee (I'm sure I spelled that one wrong). The paintings show an apparent timeline  showing significant events throughout history  such as the building of the Great Wall of China. All of the events are shown in perfect chronological order  and the very last picture on the timeline is Earth being destroyed. Now to me  if the painting showed things that had indeed happened  why would the great Doctor believe that he could somehow change what was going to happen? All that aside  the movie moved along with extreme formulaic precision. There was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all. The actors were not very good  and on a few occasions I just felt that they didn't even take the movie seriously to put forth enough effort to try to convince me that the characters were worth caring about. The whole movie was cliche ridden and a downright waste of time and money. I'd recommend Armageddon over this piece of crap any day. At least Armageddon has some good acting (compared to this)  not to mention the eye candy that is Liv Tyler. Now that I think about it  Golf isn't that bad.......,negative
It's Saturday  it's raining  and I think every movie should have at least one comment... so I just watched The Crime Doctor's Courage all the way through. It's a murder mystery with a typical cast of characters  and a couple of the usual suspects -- each with their own possible motive for the crime. The story starts abruptly and the viewer is thrown into the plot with no character development or storytelling whatsoever. I guess that's not too surprising for a B movie of this period. There are also some moments which look and feel like this is pre-WWII  but perhaps that is due to the writer's background in radio shows.<br /><br />The Crime Doctor is the sleuth who happens to be visiting California for some R&R from his psychiatry practice on the East coast. He hooks up with a mystery novelist friend with whom it is implied has been along for one or more previous mystery solving capers. The novelist occasionally fills the role of sidekick to our sleuth (AKA Dr. Watson)  and also occasionally lightens things up with a bit of comic relief (sort of).<br /><br />There is also a somewhat simple  but not quite bumbling police captain who at times is annoyed by the meddling sleuth. And then there are the mysterious Braggas  a brother and sister who are dance artists at a night-club. The dance is sort of an interpretive dance that happens to be one of those moments which feels more like the 30's than the 40's. Though the story location is California  the Braggas appear to live in a castle!<br /><br />There was one plot element which managed to keep me somewhat amused  but I won't divulge any more than that because I always enjoy movies more when the story is discovered  rather than known in advance. (even though I can think of many  many  B films which would rate higher and it is difficult to say that watching this one is time well spent) I have not seen any other movies from the Crime Doctor series  so I can't make any comparisons.,negative
This is better than the early Cronenberg horror films  but nothing more than your basic what-is-real story. The videogame theme has been told before too. Nothing original is left except the weird Cronenberg atmosphere (which is not that strong here) with the amusing sexual references and Shore's dark score. The story never grabs your full attention. It just flows forward event after event with boring pace. Rating 4/10.,negative
OkulThe School is a result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. Having used the same stories over and over again new generation directors finally come up with different ideas. Of course  it doesn't mean that they are all grand. I think Okul is one of them. It is supposed to be a scary movie but it is not. It is not successful on being scary either. So what is it? Actors are so average especially Deniz Akkaya is pretty annoying with the teacher role. I am sure it could have been better if it was tried on harder. Maybe concentrating on one topic such as making it scary or vice versa. But directors have missed the target this time. ** out of *****,negative
I was not expecting a classic  but at least a funny film. There were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more. You don't scare it is full of American teen-slasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easily.<br /><br />But it tells much about a senior student in a Turkish High-School. Pressure of Student Selection Exam (OSS) that 3-hour-exam determines which university you'll go and thinking about the exam when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration. The movie is bad. Don't waste your time to watch it.,negative
This short was director Del Lord's last and only Shemp short. The problem: It was quite weak and the cafe scene was pretty much a carbon copy of a Curly short Busy Buddies (1944). The interrogation scene was pretty funny  and the beginning part of the cafe part. But there are a lot of plotholes in this short. For example  why are the stooges hiding in the garbage can when the police come? In the remake  Of Cash And Hash(1955)  director Jules White fixes this and the reason for the stooges hiding in the garbage can is because there is a gunfight between the police and the armored car robbers. The scene in which Moe is having trouble with the oyster was done before with Curly in Dutiful But Dumb (1941). The spooky house part wasn't all that great except for the hilarious scene on the outside of the spooky house. To top it off  the ending had no sting to it. Rating: C-,negative
Contains Spoilers<br /><br />But if you weren't dropped on the head as a child and then used as a football then you'll agree with me that this is one of the worst and yet hilarious series ever made. Centreing round a woman who as a young girl was beaten by her father who also killed her mother  she spends her time drawing  but wait for it  then she becomes her superhero drawings and goes on to fight crime  therefore being drawn by pain  so clever. The story itself is actually OK  but it's just how it's done  Jesse the writer and director has no idea how to write a script  just listen to a monologue featuring the 8 year old version of the hero and it sounds like it was written by a 30 year old man  while her dad  who sports a great moustache  just walks around the house all day while looking angry  just showing how bad the characterisation is  especially the bit where he gets angry in the first episode and begins repeating the phrase no more while holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble work surface. The following bang sound effect and just his terrible acting as all he can convey is angry just is brilliant  including after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt which is all done with him moaning and looking angry in slow motion. The episodes themselves could contain easily a good clean script ranging over 5 minutes  but oh no Jesse doesn't want this. Little Jesse  is shitting out post modernism as if he'd just eaten Donnie Darko and then douched himself to death. Pointless camera jerks  all at weird angles  overly repeated lines and even pointless sequences just muddled up every now and again to fill the overlong episodes. In conclusion the idea isn't bad it's just how it's done  also there is a great character of a fat guy on a bench who doesn't come up enough and is great  i just wanna hug his Lil chubby cheeks cause they look so soft. The character development is non existent as the main character just says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head although they all contradict one another. But all in all  mainly s**t<br /><br />Indiana Jones 4 however is much better  Type Jeeharv into you-tube as well  the results may make you weep at the beauty of the world also you'll hear a lot of cheap sex jokes  mostly gay ones.,negative
First of all  the genre of this movie isn't comedy  it's more of a drama.<br /><br />I had low expectations on the movie  and still they didn't come up them. As some of the other reviews point out  there are some nice music in the movie. But if you want to listen to good music I suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with Bon Jovi  or Mötley Crue  it'll be more quality time.<br /><br />Last  if you want to watch a GOOD movie in this rock'n'roll genre  I recommend Almost Famous.,negative
80's sleazy (glam)rock is like 90's house music or current boybands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it a bit 'cult' nowadays is that it's a long time ago  so we can laugh at its sillyness. Too bad 'Rock Star' has no laughs at all  as it must be one of the most boring movies of recent years.<br /><br />Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band. When he's kicked of the band at the same time the real Steel Dragon singer is kicked of as well  he becomes the next lead singer. You already know how this is gonna end up at that time  with Chris losing it with sex  drugs and r&r and forgetting about his long-time girlfriend/manager  Emily (Jennifer Aniston).<br /><br />There's way too much (boring) music in this standard formula-packed excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all cost. Watch the (over-rated  but still more fun) Almost Famous instead  or even better  a movie about real people playing real music having real emotions  That Thing You Do.<br /><br />What a stinker. 2/10.,negative
Well........how and where do I start to describe this utter nonsense? Imagine the morals of a cheesy Hollywood Western  throw in a lavish helping of the most trite soap opera storyline  and try to dupe the kids into thinking its cool by dressing it up to be about something 'contemporary'. This film is all package and absolutely no substance.<br /><br />It starts with promise......young men dreaming of becoming rockstars and engaging in the kind of excessive hero-worship everyone can laugh at. After that  it all goes downhill.....quicker than a bobsleigh with no brakes. The scene involving the first gig with Steel Dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of 'cine kitsch' I have seen in a long time. The singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairs.....will he get up and sing???......or will he stay there on the floor and not sing......who cares by now?? It gets worse  but I don't want to bore myself by having to remember it in all its excruciating detail. If you watch it after this review  its your own fault!,negative
This is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of Rob Halford from British Metal Gods 'Judas Priest' and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens  who used to front a Priest tribute band. Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something great. Instead  someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down. From the title change of Metal God to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band I was really looking forward to seeing this  I was very let down by several points of the film. The soundtrack is very NOT metal for one  and the ending of the movie is lame as well. The movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole  it fails in the end because...1)A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2)There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi  Warrant  Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of 'heavy metal' go see this movie. If Iron Maiden  Judas Priest  Dio & Black Sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh.,negative
I don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll cliché not used in this movie. Ouffcourz   rock enroll life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you. Say it to stupid young boys. The filmmakers seemed to have read too much Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue stories. I have seen everyday life of usual rock band closely and there are nothing to do with reality in this movie. If you are successful enough your life is touring touring touring. Its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you must be fresh  sober and clean in evenings. After live you have a little time to discharge your stage excitement. Then you have a bit time to have fun. But its not any luxury or dream. Artistically this film was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogs. The ending of movie was funny -- main character left heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! Yeah  what a moral. Real 90s.,negative
Frightmare begins with a horror movie icon killing a director and then his servant before he is laid to rest. This icon  who has some Christopher Lee qualities to him  then continues to haunt those around him when a group of horror film society students steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is in.<br /><br />The first ten minutes is well-filmed  good writing and lots of potential for murderous mayhem. But the film drags in the middle (although thankfully not as much as House of Death) and never really gets that initial spurt of energy back.<br /><br />Lots of the deaths are confusing  as they seem to have people just falling over scared when they see a floating coffin or other odd things. Twice we see poisonous gas being used. But the box promises that this horror star will be the embodiment of all the monsters he has played. Boy  is that false advertising  unless he spent his career playing boring old men who take naps and watch Matlock.<br /><br />The general principle of the film is decent: horror society kids stealing a corpse of a dead icon. A modern equivalent (digging up Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would make a great film. Maybe a remake is in order if that wouldn't be too disrespectful. Sometimes theory doesn't come across as well in application  and this film offers that example.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality of this film (besides the beginning) is the brief appearance of a very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw him and thought that's Jeffrey Combs but felt I was mistaken as the box never mentioned him. But sure enough  Combs was present. (A note to this movie's film-makers: mention Combs on the cover of the DVD  you'll sell more copies if if you would be deceiving customers.) If you're a Jeffrey Combs die-hard  check out this early role. Otherwise  I cannot offer this as a great selection for a horror movie marathon. Let me suggest Intruder or Popcorn  as those are both pretty decent and will stand the test of time.,negative
No emotion. Bad music (and I am a reformed eighties metal guy  so I would be vulnerable to some good stuff.) Everything is half done. The brother is a parody  there is nothing to hold us in except to see what horror from the eighties they'll pull up next. The tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing but isn't given enough time. Wahlberg is okay and Aniston is slumming. We know she didn't need the money. Is this the only role she could fit into her summer break? Surely she must slap her forehead every time it pops up on VH1--which is only slightly less often than Ozzy does. It barely qualifies as a TV movie. It's just hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically.,negative
Here is another great film critics will love. The problem is that it is not a very good movie.<br /><br />The films premise is simple. Nine convicts escape a prison after the tenth one goes crazy and tells them where the treasure is.<br /><br />The first half has a lot of slapstick some of it very broad while the second half is a character driven descent into fantasy and melancholy.<br /><br />The two halves simply don't mix. Individual scenes do work very well (The guys crashing a friends house who has a new Filipino bride is hilarious While a later scene with the big guy working in the restaurant tugs at the heartstrings.) They simply don't mesh with each other.<br /><br />The movie as well is missing entire set-ups. One scene shows the guys desperately looking for change under a deserted vending machine to buy a snack. The very next scene has the whole crew in drag sitting down in a restaurant. Where did they get the dresses and wigs? (The crew includes both the big guy and a midget) How did they get all the clothes and money to buy the meal? And most puzzling is why are they in drag? They are clearly guys in drag and lets face it is there anything more memorable to witnesses than a big guy and a dwarf eating a meal dressed as women? I mention the big guy and the dwarf because besides the old guy everyone else seems to blend into each other. (In fact they wear matching white jumpsuits throughout most of the movie) The movie has very little character development in the first half and as a result the second half really lacks an emotional punch. As we are often trying to figure out who is who in their individual payoff scenes.<br /><br />Speaking of a drag the second half has all those wonderful sweeping camera shots and big emotional moments and great symbolism that makes a great film. It is also excruciatingly slow which makes for a boring movie.<br /><br />9 Souls is a big disappointment  the reviews gush about a great film and it's in there somewhere  good luck finding it yourself.,negative
The idea of nine stupid prisoners escaping and going on a road trip sounds pretty good for a movie. Especially because it's meant to be funny and I guess heart-warming in some weird way. The problem is  the movie was very rarely funny and often just seemed pointless and needlessly gross. It was as if jokes or interesting scenes were being set up again and again but no one bothered finishing any of them--there was just no payoff. Also  the movie was just brainless and had the crooks meandering across Japan even though they left so many crime victims alive that it's impossible to believe they wouldn't have been caught almost immediately--especially since they continued to keep using the same stolen camper for days on end. And as far as being gross goes  I just didn't need to see scene after scene after scene of guys peeing along the side of the road. Plus  believe it or not  there is a scene where four of the guys are out raping sheep!<br /><br />All in all  I really hated this movie. And it's a shame  as I almost always love Japanese films--just not poorly made and uninteresting ones like this one.,negative
Critics love this movie. I personally found it senseless and tasteless. This is the millionth time I've fallen into the critics love it trap and came out wishing someone would throw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching the movie. There are many scenes that are completely unnecessary. A warning to Animal lovers: Don't see this movie if you don't want to see sheep killed and molested.<br /><br />If you want to see a good Asian film  see Afrika. If you want to see a film about escaped convicts  see the Gene Wilder/Richard Pryor classic Stir Crazy. Avoid 9 Souls like the plague.,negative
I watched this last nite with an open mind. Sorry to say it is still bad. first  the movie is too noisey and you can't hear what people are saying. The accents are bad especially Richard Masur. What is the French chick doing in this film ??? Miscasting at its worst. Walken's makeup is strange. The Harvard scene is useless and not needed. Kristoferson's character is unlikeable and I wanted him to get killed and go away. Meanwhile  the Walken character gets killed too early and easily ( despite the makeup). The settlers are all stupid. GET ORGANIZED you bunch of hicks  people are coming to kill you !!!!! John Hurts character provides some humor buts thats all.<br /><br />I have nothing good to say about this excessive piece of crap. The only good thing is it ruined the director's career and killed United Artists.<br /><br />Still Crap after all these years.,negative
I have just recently seen Heaven's Gate. After i watched this 3 hr 40 min epic western that's not a western  i read the book by Steven Bach. After considering all events and the movie itself  i still think this movie is a complete waste of time. I believe that when someone tells you to watch it  they are  in fact  trying to bore you to death. If for some reason you can enjoy this self indulgent over thought truely bad movie  i have to ask why. Though this isn't a reason to hate it  it is historically way off. It pretends to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming called the Johnson County War. Simply  the cattle barrons of the time wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all immagrants. You find that you simply do not care about these people and hope they all get killed because at least then  something would happen. Everybody in the movie talks about things that happen  and it is never shown. After you sit though this giant waste of time you wonder how someone could actually make a 4 hr epic in which nothing happens. Oh and by the way the Johnson County war was not a war  it never happened. The Johnson County war  in fact  was called that because it almost happened  in actual fact  2 people died. I can't warn you enough off this movie. However  if you're like me the  the idea of watching a movie that ruined careers and put United Artists on the for sale lot  sounds like an interesting case to study  then by all means  watch this terrible  narsisistic  movie with no sub-text  and a lot of photography.(which is lovely sometimes),negative
The operative rule in the making of this film seems to have been never make a 1 minute scene when you can make it a 10 minute scene. This was a principle set right from the start with an interminably long portrayal of the graduation of the Harvard class of 1870. The point of that scene  I suppose  was to introduce some of the primary figures in the story and give a bit of their background - which is somewhat effective when comparing the idealism of the Harvard graduation ceremony to the realism of life in Johnson County  Wyoming  but it just keeps going and going  and that sets the stage for a film that features repeated stretches of mind-numbing nothingness  made even worse by the fact that I found a significant amount of the dialogue to be almost incoherent. In the end  I couldn't even watch this in one sitting. I got through about half of it and had to set it aside for a couple of days before I could drag myself back to see how it turned out.<br /><br />My reaction to this movie in many ways is a shame  because there are positives here. The performances are generally of a high calibre  especially from Kris Kristofersson as Averill  Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story - interspersed as it is around that ever-present mind-numbing nothingness - is potentially interesting  focusing on the efforts of immigrants to establish themselves in Johnson County and a local cattle company's efforts to stop them by killing a number of them in collaboration with the government and the military. There's also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots. Having said that  the whole thing could frankly have been done in half the time - and should have been. In the end  all those potential positives are washed out by - again - the mind-numbing nothingness that the movie seems to revolve around. Seriously - 2/10.,negative
My parents used to rent a lot of horror movies when I was a child. We loved watching them even when they were bad they made for some enjoyment. This was one such movie  kind of hard to review as I have only seen it the one time as a child  but it is not anything I want to track down again so I can do a more in-depth review. The story has some old horror actor legend dying. I seem to remember he acted a bit like an over the top Vincent Price  without being likable and classy. He commits murders and dies  but what is this? Is the movie over already? No  as some kids for some reason snag the body and are prepared for a fun night of being killed by the ham from beyond the grave. I remember the murders were nothing all that special after the first couple and I remember this movie was rather disappointing. Seemed to have a good premise  but it just failed to deliver the goods as more cool kills were needed and that super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire.,negative
The director spent a lot of time making the scenes look real right down to the historical photos and all the sounds of the old west bustle. Too bad the Producers and Writer/Director  Michael Cimino  spent zero time on any of the historical facts of what the Johnson County war was really about. A lot of the war was over how public lands should be used for grazing. The cattlemen didn't want the poor sheep herders on the land to compete for forage on this cold  windswept plateau. The entire epic makes no mention of grazing sheep which was one of the most important reasons for the war.<br /><br />The worst scene is the battle between the peasants and the hired killers. The peasants are shown circling the gunmen like a bunch of Indians would do in much earlier Hollywood movies. The true fact is that Johnson County Sheriff William (Red) Angus  with a posse of 200 to 300 men  intercepted the gunmen and trapped them in a barn at the TA ranch. I doubt any women took part in the siege. <br /><br />Ellen (Ella also known as Cattle Kate) Watson and her second husband  James Averell  were hanged by a lynch mob about three years before the Johnson County invasion. Ella was never a prostitute. This was a canard spread by the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA) in order to discredit her. The fact that the plot makes her out to be a brothel madam only serves the interests of the WSGA.<br /><br />I object to the use of names of real people in a plot that is so obviously fiction. There is no fact in the events  time lines  or backgrounds of the characters. Why Michael Cimino would use real names of people who were loosely connected with the Johnson County war (and events leading up to it) is beyond me.<br /><br />The movie could have been much more interesting if it had dwelt on the political ramifications of the Federal Government intervention in a State Government's affairs and what happened after the WSGA gunmen were saved by the Calvary. Some effort was made to prosecute the Cattlemen who were responsible by the Johnson County attorney. But since Johnson county could not afford the court costs and the Governor of Wyoming  Amos W. Barber  backed the WSGA  the charges were eventually dropped.<br /><br />Overall I think the movie was just an excuse to show Isabelle Huppert naked for much of the three and 3/4 hours of running time on the DVD version.,negative
Now infamous Western that was (at its time) the biggest budgeted disaster in Hollywood history. I was lucky enough to see the full 220 minute version at a theatre in 1990. It was truly staggering how BAD the film was!<br /><br />They had a great cast  a story based on a true incident (a fight between foreigners and Americans in the 1800s)  magnificent scenery...so what went wrong? Three words--director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after The Deer Hunter he went out and made this god awful Western. He's not totally to blame. His previous film The Deer Hunter was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him free reign to do anything. They let him all alone...and everything went wrong. The cost went barreling out of control and Cimino insisted on redoing sequences again and again until they were perfect.<br /><br />First off  the sound is horrible. Entire sequences go by and you can't make out a word the characters are saying. For instance  Jeff Bridges' character is introduced during a dance sequence  but I STILL have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his introductory scene is incomprehensible! That's the director's fault--he should have made sure the dialogue could be heard. Some scenes are shot with so much dust flying around you can barely make out what's going on. The story line doesn't make a whole lot of sense and Cimino took great liberties with the facts--in the real story only one person was killed--Cimino turns it into a massacre. There is some admittedly beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. Also the bad sound was not the fault of the theatre--all the prints sound that way.<br /><br />This garbage effectively closed down United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. A textbook example of a director so full of himself he doesn't realize what he's doing. Jeff Bridges has said this is the worst movie he ever did. This is from a guy who made Tron! A definite must-miss.<br /><br />There is a pretty good book called The Final Cut which details the whole disaster. This gets a 1. I wish IMDb had negative numbers--this deserves it!,negative
This is the movie that  pretty much  sounded the death knell for the auteur in Hollywood. At over 40 million bucks  Heaven's Gate is so poorly conceived and executed it would take a lifetime to break down every area of failure. What really galls me the most about it is that technically it's very bad  an unforgivable sin for the money that went into it. John Hurt's commencement speech at Harvard is inaudible  as is a conversation between Kris Kristofferson and Richard Masur at the train station. Some people seem to think Cimino intended this as a style. He didn't. It's just bad sound recording. The characters are not particularly well-drawn  except for the four or five leads; in the climactic battle scene  it's difficult to tell who's the bad guys and who's the good guys. Even on that level  it's impossible to enjoy the movie. The casting of Isabelle Huppert as the town madam is a joke  her French accent renders the whole character a fraud. The acting is generally stiff  without any range or depth of feeling; even Christopher Walken is bad. John Hurt's character is the only one with any swagger or vitality (although Hurt  in his 40s  playing a fresh-faced Harvard grad with bags under his eyes is patently ridiculous). <br /><br /> I guess to say that it's overlong is overkill. The roller-skating sequence could have been easily cut  the cockfight scene is rapidly becoming a movie cliche  and the final scene on board the ocean liner is right out the Twilight Zone. Having Rod Serling appear before the camera at the end to explain what we just watched would have been the perfect finale. Actually  those scenes in and of themselves are not bad  but Cimino has not earned the right to include them  because what he's given us as the meat of the picture IS so incompetently bad. The editing is poor  especially in the grand battle climax. At one point  the same explosion with the same wagon wheel flying from the blast is used three different times. I wish could I say something- anything- nice about this movie: a great scene  a great performance  even one memorable line of dialogue  but I can't. It is all just one big unholy mess. About the only thing I did like was the cinematography and the Montana locations  which are stunning. Even Cimino couldn't screw that up. This is a long  boring  bad movie by all standards. And the people who say that it gets bashed only because of the cost overruns are just kidding themselves. 1/2 * out of 4,negative
Let's see. What annoyed me most? The extra long dance scene in the beginning watching people twirling around so much I got dizzy... Without even showing where the music was coming from... All part of a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the film. Or perhaps it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to. What a drag this film is. And the most annoying aspect is the bad guys are so bad  so obviously horrible that it seems as if the director were making this film for second graders. These people are bad... These people are good. Whenever a movie has its agenda-heart on its sleeve I am beside myself. There's a scene in a rollerskating rink that seems totally out of place. Long drawn-out love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie. John Hurt's character  who is part of the overlong beginning scene  drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains. His death scene could very well be the stupidest in history. And I hear everyone  even the haters of this film  talk about how gorgeous the cinematography is. I think it looks washed-out. Watch Days of Heaven if you want to see gorgeous backyards. This movie is even worse than the anti- hype. It's pointless. The epilogue  showing the main character in a yacht  was almost as dumb as the prologue. The battle scenes are tedious and dizzying. This movie is really bad. Avoid it unless you love bad movies  because this is the king of them.,negative
"The recent death of Stephen Bach  one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE  has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film. Moreover the original release  the long version was recently shown on TCM exposing the film  in ail probability  to its largest audience ever. <br /><br />I saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd Avenue cinema across the street from Bloomingdales. I think it was released on a Friday and withdrawn on the following Wednesday. Maybe that wasn't a fair release but it was and is a terrible film. Seeing the full-length version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty years more experience watching and writing about films I am better able to articulate why.<br /><br />First there is the dreaded phrase mise-en-scene whose definition is at the same time so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzles even after being defined. Basically it's everything that happens in front of a camera. For example  a crowd extra will be given a piece of action  say just walking by on the sidewalk and a spot to start from. When the assistant director yells action the extra will go through their action. If there's another take the extra will return to the start spot and go again on action. All of the extras do this. Then say a cab drives up to the sidewalk and the star gets out and embraces another principal while all the while the crowd extras are doing their thing. This is mise-en-scene. In the theatre they call it blocking but cinema is far more multi-dimensional.<br /><br />The importance of defining mise-en-scene is because when the French critics developed their theory of the auteur the opposite of an auteur was a métier-en-scene  even more derogatorily referred to as a traffic cop. An auteur was intimately involved in the meaning of a film and through the director's body of work a theme or themes discerned. The metier-en-scene was basically a company man rendering in film what had been handed to him on paper. It is the difference between say John Ford and Sam Wood.<br /><br />The second point is how the director  Michael Cimino  got into the position of directing films. Cimino first gained prominence directing the first million-dollar TV commercial. This depicted a Chevrolet floating down the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on any lists of greatest TV commercials of all time and is notable solely because of how expensive it was and how utterly exaggerated it was. The effect is like that of a three year old girl brought out to entertain company who gets her biggest response when she flings her dress over her head. Cute for a three year old  embarrassing for a thirty year old. So Cimino was praised early on for spending a huge amount of money for some over-the-top image and so he learned.<br /><br />His first film  THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974) has a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a lunatic's car that drives back and forth  back and forth  until it drives off the road and the driver opens the trunk full of rabbits which he proceeds to shoot one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer  Eastwood  hadn't stepped in  that the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed.<br /><br />Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I guess if one watches the film on a DVD in snatches like a mini-series it can be impressive. This is because scenes are directed with such a dense mise-en-scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia it's just plain exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this. Its like sex  at some point it just becomes a whipping. There is the opening 40 minutes  which takes place at Harvard. Brilliantly photographed at Oxford  it is something of a non-sequitur. I personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial _Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna tell you of most films. However the whole preface adds up to only one line- Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later All of that time  money and effort  not to mention all of the audiences' attention and energy just to deliver this almost useless piece of information.<br /><br />Then there's the scene in the street between Kristofferson and Masur which just goes on and on with a populated city of background extras and horse drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a tiny bit of expositional information. It's just so exhausting. There is just one scene after another like this. It's like trying to eat a thirty- pound pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconsequential details and unintelligible  witless dialogue  which go on and on and are exhausting and boring. <br /><br />Of course any single scene excerpted looks brilliant. Overall it's a rich piece to spin praiseworthy articles about. Seen in snatches with the possibility of fast-forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off if feeling mise-en-scene whipped  it's basically painless. But don't let anybody tell you it's a good film. When I saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse and he turns one way and then the other and does this about six times. That's symbolic, he said  of he doesn't know which way to go. That is basically  at its kernel  the basis of every pro- Heaven's Gate critique.<br /><br />Watch it  if you must  but be forewarned  this is not a film whose time has come  this is a stinker which will smell for all time. <br /><br />HEAVEN'S GATE is historically inaccurate in the extreme. I recommend the book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS by Asa Mercer on the Johnson County War.",negative
I watched the 219 minute version and have to say that dollar-for-dollar  it it probably one of the worst films ever. Now I am NOT saying it's THE worst film ever--but if you look at a ratio of cost over how much an average person would enjoy it  this is a very  very bad film.<br /><br />I would say that the single biggest factor making this a bad film is the writer/director  Michael Cimino. Rarely can so much blame be placed on a single person. Had he not been so self-indulgent  a film just as bad could have easily been made at about 90 minutes--saving the studio millions! <br /><br />The film begins with a completely unnecessary prologue that's supposed to be set at Harvard. The scene is HUGE but completely without context. You have no idea exactly what is occurring nor do you know why the students (in particular  John Hurt) are behaving so boorishly. I find it very hard to imagine a commencement going like this in 1870--and it looks a lot more like 1970. This is a half hour where you have no idea what is happening  who the characters are or their motivations. <br /><br />The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably  the two Harvard grads (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So  they went to the best school in America and now one is only a law man in the middle of no where and the other is....well  what IS John Hurt in the film?!?! He just appears here and there and seems to be either a jerk (the prologue) or a pathetic and pointless drunk who hangs out with murderers--even though he is apparently against them!? His entire character made no sense. They never explained why he was a Brit living in the middle of nowhere (it was impossible to hide his accent)  why he bothered to come along with the hired army IF he was so against their wicked plan nor why he would risk his life for a cause he didn't believe in at all. As for Kristofferson  his excellent acting and better defined character made his character more believable  though having him move to Wyoming AND risk his life for a prostitute made no sense at all.<br /><br />This brings up the worst aspect of HEAVEN'S GATE. While the scenes are WAY TOO LONG and needed trimming  the worst part of the film is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor with nothing to do in the film)  Jeff Bridges and many other big names are there but you have no idea why. In fact  other than Kristofferson  Isabelle Huppert (as a hooker with a heart of gold--quite the cliché) and perhaps Christopher Walken  EVERYONE is completely one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine a movie THIS long where you don't know or understand the characters. <br /><br />Much of the film also seems anachronistic. Who would have thought to have a giant roller rink constructed in the middle of no where in 1890? I am sure that just getting the basic supplies in this region in the West would have been very  very difficult--and yet we are expected to believe that trains filled with roller skates and lumber arrived instead of FOOD. Maybe if they hadn't spent a bazillion dollars building and frequenting the roller rink  the farmers could have afforded to BUY food and avoided this war over purloined cattle!!! And what's with the guy on roller skates with the fiddle? What did this have to do with a land war? <br /><br />The most obvious problem you are left with is that it's a film where very  very little actually happens until the big battle late in the film. There are lots of scenes of filth and flat nothingness. So much nothingness that by the time the battle occurs  many audience members would have left or are now so hostile to the film that it's inevitable that nothing could salvage the film.<br /><br />As for the final battle  it was done reasonably well but had problems. First  this minor skirmish on the prairie lasted longer than the D-Day invasion!! Second  while details of the actual events of the so-called Johnson County War are a tad sketchy  we do know that the characters played by Huppert and Kristofferson never actually were there  as they'd both been hung BEFORE the battle. Third  I can't believe that Cimino actually killed animals throughout the film--especially during the final battle. While I am far from a bleeding heart about animal rights  his need to use animal guts and actually kill some of the horses is a low point in cinematic history. Watching and knowing that some of the horses died to achieve Cimino's vision for the film is very sad.<br /><br />Finally  after the big battle  we have an epilogue. While it is blessedly short  it also seemed completely unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a fancy yacht  so we can assume that he's finally putting some of that Harvard education to work for himself. We also see a woman who appears to be one that Kris looked at a couple times during the prologue. Most importantly  nothing is said and you have no idea what the final outcome. I read up on it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong.<br /><br />Overall  to say the film is long and needed tons more editing was like saying WWII was a minor tiff. Well  I've certainly seen a lot worse  but if you factor in the cost of production  I truly think it might just be one of the worst films in history.<br /><br />Finally  when a film has this much explicit nudity I warn parents. However  as no child COULD sit through this film (even with a promise of sex)  the warning is not necessary.,negative
It is unsettling seeing so many people giving outrageously high ratings to this film. Some of the praise uses such twisted reasoning (and transparent agendas that betray a simple love of anything that is in any way critical of the U.S.) that it approaches hysteria.<br /><br />Heaven's Gate is a bad movie  it is fundamentally awful. Endless scenes using elaborate shots that serve no purpose  muddy dialogue  murky narative  no sense of any theme aside from excess...<br /><br />The high rating of this disaster is a product of revisionist history and temporary shifts in perception.<br /><br />For some perspective watch Lawrence of Arabia before watching Heaven's Gate. You will see just how aimless and lost this film truly is. The issues it may have been trying to deal with are lost in a miasma.<br /><br />I have no problem with films that are critical of the U.S. per se  but when a terrible film gets such undeserved praise purely because of that element... that's worth challenging.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing for two reasons; curiosity  and as a cautionary tale for young filmmakers.<br /><br />I saw this at home for free  imagine the torture of being in a theater and sitting through it... for 4 meandering hours!,negative
"Attention  possible spoilers<br /><br />This film is so lousy that it actually becomes funny. The director has put in all the clichés that have ever plagued B-series movies. The stupid bimbo (nice rack) getting caught again and again by the bad guys  chief villain smirky and revealing his plots before they happen so they can be ruined and who  of course  bullied/killed the hero's father in an unclear past  a side-kick in the person of a policeman - small  bald and whose only preparation for the last battle (another cliché) is returning his baseball-cap rim-backwards etc. <br /><br />The film's end really tops it. After the chief villain dies when the hero Paralised Stoneface Jack or whatever throws him from the roof of a building ten stories high  they walk out of the building. Which  from the exteriors  looks three stories high only and very much like your regular city hall. <br /><br />When they exit the building  the side-kick can't walk  being that his right leg appears to be wounded. How  nobody can tell: ten minutes earlier he fell down shot in his shoulder and his feet were fine. There is no further explanation for the inquisitive mind of the viewer who would be curious to know such trivial things as Where is the villain's body which should lay near the building? and Why is there no police or even curious folks gathered round the said body?. <br /><br />I could go on forever with the list. Why does another one of the bad guys claim to have invented martial arts when he gets his ass kicked in no time? Why do bad guys in general make silly movements when attacking? Why does the hero look so faggy? Is there anyone really thinking yes, these characters and this plot makes this a film to remember? And the actors suck. Our hero and saviour of the day wears the same expression on his face. The whole film. That disgusted-trying to be cocky smirk must be some copyrighted feat of him.<br /><br />Also  thinking that until now 12% of the people having rated this film gave it a 10 makes me full of fear inside. They might have been serious and then we're doomed.",negative
I think vampire movies (usually) are wicked. Even if the film itself isn't all that good  I still like it 'cos its got vampires in it. But this stinks. It really does give vampire movies a bad name.<br /><br />For a start  the cheapness really shows. I'm not usually that bothered about low budget films - one of my favourite all-time movies is El Mariachi which only cost $7000 - but I hate this. The actions a load of crap as well  resorting to a 'stylish' wobbling camera which gives you headache.<br /><br />Theres not much more to say other than don't watch this. I bought it for £1.50 as it was an ex-rental and I feel cheated out of my money  even for that low price.,negative
Don Wilson stars as Jack Cutter (Ooh real tough name!)a vampire slayer who goes up against a vampire army  you see the story is a little different because vampires can't be killed with silver  crosses or sunlight but rather through snapping their necks (How convenient as it cuts down on the budget) and it's here Cutter runs into a reporter (Melanie Smith of Trancers III fame) Night Hunter's action sequences shake for no reason during the fight sequences and although it's meant to emphasize the mood  it just makes the movie more jarring. What is worse is that these fight sequences are botched beyond belief as Wilson's martial artistry is disguised by disjointed editing. Of course the most interest comes from the fact that indeed this predates Blade  however the problem is that this was done on a small budget and that it had Don Wilson in it. It's from Roger Corman and basically this turkey is a movie most people would pay NOT to see. I unfortunately am a bottom feeder and I cater to the section of the store looking for gems  in this line of work you always run into turds. With Night Hunter  I just may have the world's stinkiest turd.<br /><br />1/2* out of 4-(Awful),negative
Pun intended. This low budget action/horror vehicle for Don Wilson's ability to kick things is the stuff direct-to-video fare is made of.<br /><br />The plot: Wilson is a humorless vampire hunter who comes under fire from local law enforcement after he is forced to slaughter creatures of the night in view of the public. Police chase him  vampires chase him  he responds by kicking...a lot.<br /><br />There is a little more to the story  but it is so inconsequential that I honestly can't remember it; I think people actually spoke in the movie  but that's up to debate. The plot is nothing more than a set-up for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible in the running time  usually by kicking them.<br /><br />The technical specs are  in a word  anemic. Little color treating  amateurish use of lighting  simplistic use of camera and angle. Blood and gore is noticeably limited  odd for this type of film. The most hurtful of the filming foul-ups is the jarring shift to super-shaky cam during each and every fight scene. If the camera begins to bounce around like a reese monkey on speed  then you know Don is about to start kicking everything in sight.<br /><br />All in all  this is the kind of bad movie that can be made good with a few friends and a lot of cynical humor. Otherwise  do not watch  unless you really like to watch things get kicked.<br /><br />3/10,negative
"One of the last surviving horror screen greats - Conrad Radzoff - dies and has his body placed in a mausoleum with televised-before-death snippets of the great Conrad greeting you as you visit. Unfortunately for him and his captors  Conrad's body is borrowed by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him  toast him  dance with him  laugh with and at him  and then put him to bed in a casket which just happens to by lying in a room upstairs. News of the missing body reaches Radzoff's widow and her friend(who happens to be proficient in the black arts) and she holds some kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so he can  in his own words  get an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Well  Frightmare is an interesting bad film. Sure  it is cheap. The sets look like they were borrowed(which I am sure they were). The special effects and blood and guts are done liberally and with little credibility. The acting is average to below average with a few exceptions. Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame is in tow  but really he does little in this rather thankless role as a horror obsessed teen that needs to steal a dead man's body for kicks. None of the kids except the pretty girl playing Meg is any good. Nita Talbot plays the friend of the Radzoffs with withering interest. Also  look for the big - I mean big - guy that plays the policeman. That is Porky himself of Porkys fame. But thankfully for all of us  one performance does rise above the material. Ferdy Mayne  an oft overlooked actor from Germany who had Christopher Lee features and did star as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers  does a more than commendable job as the aging horror icon in public life and a real demon of a man in private life. Conrad Radzoff in a bad human being in life  living solely for his own pleasures and we see him kill twice before he is even dead(obviously none of the swinging teens at that point). Mayne is able to look very regal  speak very elegantly  and convey menace with ease. If for no other reason  one should see Frightmare for his performance. I do; however  believe that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff that they used Christopher Lee footage(anyone have any thoughts?). Anyway  one can guess what happens and it does indeed: Radzoff goes out and goes after the kids that disturbed his peace. Again  the formula is trite and overused. The acting for the most part is anemic  and the direction oh so ridiculous. But Mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ineptitude. Definitely worth a little peek. Watching Mayne keep popping up on screens in his mausoleum brought a wry smile to my lips each time.",negative
This is really a terrible film by any of the regular yardsticks. Plot  storyline  acting  effects  direction - I could go on. Suffice to say it's poor. However  it has a certain appeal. Many totally out of context sex scenes appear  it's fun looking for the Batman references. Umm - that's it. Poor really  don't bother.,negative
You have to see this movie  it's a big footnote in the history of film. When this film was made  American film industry reached the bottom of sucking. See this movie  laugh  and feel sorry for yourself for wasting the last 2 hours of your life. It's the worst acting I've seen and even worse directing. The villains laugh like they're taken from a clown circus and if the guys who did Scary Movie want to do a parody on superhero movies they only have to take the script from this movie and do a remake  called Black Scorpion III: The threat of really really bad movies who in some way manages to lure the production companies into a sequel suicide.,negative
There is part of one sequence where some water rushes into the sunken plane  everything else that happens in this movie is stock footage for Airport 77. You can even make out Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some of the shots. A total rip off? Well almost by definition. There may be more stock footage in this film than in Plan 9 From Outer Space.<br /><br />All the new material  actors sitting around in an airplane set talking  is bland and terrible on every level. Dennis Weaver is totally wasted in a career low movie  though that's true for everyone other than this films director Fred Olen Ray  who uses one of this many necessary fake names in order to keep working.<br /><br />There is a level of scant professionalism that makes this film such a waste of time  it would actually be better if shot by someone with no technical knowledge at all  because Ray has just enough knowledge about how to put together a scene in the worst old school TV fashion that this film  like most of his films  is totally devoid of life. The worst kind of hack work. The worst kind of film. Boring.<br /><br />This type of film is a waste of money  an affair where the crew on all levels are ghosts hoping to get whatever scant pay check they can and that no one will see or know they appeared/ participated in this rip off. There are so many people who want to make movies it's disgusting to see Ray burn up the money given to do nothing more but fill time.<br /><br />His commentary track is interesting in that he has to start it by explaining that he is really Fred Ray as he isn't credited on the film itself. That tricked me into seeing it don't let it trick you.,negative
Submerged is definitely NOT the worst movie ever. It does have its flaws  such as borrowed footage  crazy script and non-existent special effects (these are the worst)  but it also has some good points too. The acting is surprisingly good  there are LOTS of familiar faces whom you probably know if u're a b-movie fan like me.<br /><br />I was very glad to see Brent Huff playing one of the heroes  knowing him mostly for his 80's action films  and i must admit  he is not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson  Maxwell Caulfield & Tim Thomerson get some limited screen time  but are believable in their parts. The eye-candies in this Fred Olen Ray movie are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert  both looking very sexy and very mean. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscle to the background as a Navy SEAL. Unfortunately the only cast member who (in my opinion) is completely out of place is Coolio. He doesn't act at all  talks like he didn't even read the script  and being a badass in the beginning of the movie  gets shot like a wimp a hour later. Not a good choice.<br /><br />To sum this movie up - this is not such a bad choice for late night entertainment. If you can get over the special effects thing (so many guns  so much fire  and not a single wound on anyone)  Coolio's annoying performance  and the recycled footage from Airport 77  you might like this no-brainer after all.,negative
This film has to rank down there with Ed Wood films. A terrible script and bad  bad acting.<br /><br />A machine gun fight in front of plate glass windows; minutes go by before anyone is hit and nobody has cover - not one window ever breaks. You'd think after a fire fight like that the big U-Haul truck might be riddled - not a scratch.<br /><br />Do CIA agents and government contractors =shout= Top Secret information at a stand-up cocktail party with hundreds of people around.<br /><br />There isn't one actor you care about; everyone is shallow and basically unlikable.<br /><br />A Hawaii bound 747 flies out of Los Angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the Pacific ...in 100 feet of water.... A short time passes when the stewardess announces to the five other passengers they only have two hours of air left; on a 747?<br /><br />The next day the rescue teams show-up and amazingly the six passengers are still alive.<br /><br />A movie that starts out mediocre and goes from bad to worse.<br /><br />,negative
This is a terrible movie that only gets worse and seems to never end. The acting was bad  the plot was worse  and the special effects seemed to have been created by a 5th grade science class. Dennis Weaver is such a great actor and should have never taken such a part. My advise  DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!,negative
Boring  ridicules and stupid Submerged is a waste of time. The shootouts were a joke  real people do not just stand out in the open with out any cover  hoping to get shot first! So many things wrong or bad  not worth the effort to list  except one major flaw. At 500 mph for 20 minutes = about 166 miles west of L.A. and the water is 100ft deep??? Even at that  none of the people would have survived the decompression from being subjected to 100ft of water pressure for more then 20 hours when they were brought up. Just a awful.,negative
Okay  I just had to sound off on this one... Like a tremendous mental-gimp  I've just sat through this film in its entirety.<br /><br />You'll note that the trivia section of IMDB points out that portions of the raising of the 747 were borrowed from Airport 1977. This really doesn't scratch the surface... Virtually all exterior shots of the plane skimming the ocean  landing in  sinking  and even the at-rest shots are borrowed from Airport '77. All of the raising shots are pulled from '77  including most of the interior flooding clips  with the exception of Dennis Weaver's drowning. I couldn't help but wonder if Olivia Dehavilland might come floating by at any moment  or maybe a dead Tom Sullivan. Another eye-roller: Dennis Weaver's name in this film is Stevens  which is to compensate for the fact that Airport '77's plane is owned by the Stevens Corporation (headed by Jimmie Stewart of course).<br /><br />This is a veritable calvalcade of actors who don't work much  or at least haven't worked in a while  which might have been the first clue that it was going to be a real stinker.<br /><br />I've rated this film a 2 - It's quite worthy of a 1  but if this film can't offer any other redeeming quality  at least somebody helped Coolio  Max Caulfield  Nicolle Eggert  and Dennis Weaver make their car payments that month!,negative
This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen (not including anything by or with Pauly Shore). I couldn't believe that a film could actually be THIS bad!<br /><br />Coolio has to be the single worst actor (again  not including Pauly Shore) to ever star in a movie. The temptation to hit the STOP button during this movie was huge (in fact  if there was a THROW IN THE TRASH button on my VCR  I would have been inclined to press that).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor  and do something more interesting than watch this movie  like watching the grass grow  or watching golf on TV.,negative
"Among the many accolades here for this production  there was one individual whose comments asked if he/she were the only one (who wasn't that enthralled by it) - i.e. giving this film 3 stars. However  the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story  and other production of same. Well  this person isn't the only one, who didn't like this production (include me!) but there I part company even with him/her. If you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this flick again  I'd watch it  certainly - but I'd probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it. I'd much prefer being locked into solitary confinement  or having to watch paint dry on a wall  though. Further  I wouldn't want to see this story again  anytime  anywhere  or in any alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel's pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo, and this is one of those for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine  Long Hot Summer, and while not a huge fan of the show  enjoyed Murder, She Wrote. But HERE -- I not only didn't care for the story or other aspects  but I found Angela's squealing  squawking  singing  and everything else about her over-the-top performance  perhaps the MOST ANNOYING presence in any movie (or presentation in any other media) I've ever experienced. It was like an unending continuation of Audrey Hepburn's equally over-the top Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portions of My Fair Lady. But that was incident to the plot  presented for light  comedic effect  and (mercifully) brief. Unmercifully  this was anything but brief  and to me seemed as if it had gone-on for about 10 hours (Einstein's layman's explanation of relativity at work.) If I hadn't been with friends  with the necessity to remain  MY viewing would have been brief. I laughed  though  at the Seinfeld episode where Elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked The English Patient. My friends somewhat regarded me the same way when I interrupted their waxing ecstatically over this movie. Give me some dragging fingernails loudly over a chalk board anytime instead.",negative
Conrad Radzoff(Ferdy Mayne)  a hammy cult icon  dies from a heart ailment(not before disposing of an ungrateful assistant and TV commercial director  both of whom disrespected him with showers of insults). His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students(they wish to invite him to dinner..they are quite big fans). What these kids(..including a young Jeffrey Combs)don't expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected by a medium to wreak havoc on those who removed him from his place of rest.<br /><br />The list of violent acts include Radzoff pulling one guy's tongue out  setting a woman on fire  elevating a casket which crushes a woman's face  decapitates one fellow  and cremates another guy alive in a coffin. A really weird soundtrack and pesky fog wraps around Radzoff's ghoulish activities.<br /><br />Silly hokum from Troma is limited by a very  very low budget and slowwwwww pace. The film feels a lot longer than it is. The film isn't really that gory and we can hardly see much violence because the film is often too damn dark. At times  Radzoff is an ominous presence  yet at other times he just looks real silly.,negative
Some aspects of this production are good  such as the performances of Angela Lansbury  George Hearn  Cris Groenendaal  and Sal Mistretta. But am I the only one who is distracted by the horrible performance by Betsy Joslyn as Johanna? She is terrible! She slauters the songs with her screechy voice and overacts in a role she clearly doesn't understand. I also think the chorus isn't up to snuff. They drag the tempo and make the worst facial expressions. Overall  I think this production is okay  but Sweeney Todd can be so much more if done correctly. This production doesn't come near the level this material demands. The concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.,negative
"I finally got hold of a DVD copy of this production and was agog with curiosity  since I had read so many people praising it to the skies  particularly Angela Lansbury's portrayal of Mrs. Lovett. I saw the Tim Burton movie a few months ago and thought it over the top and overly bloody; thankfully this version is not so horrifying gory but it suffers dramatically in too many other ways for it to be in the least satisfying to me.<br /><br />To begin with  the casting. George Hearn is adequate and at least shows some expression (as opposed to Johnny Depp's unending wooden face in the movie). Angela Lansbury is  quite simply  annoying. At least she has enough power in her voice to get the point across as opposed to Helena Bonham Carter's piping and expressionless little girl's voice  but subtlety seems to be only a word in the dictionary to Ms. Lansbury. One cannot be drawn into the story when one of the main characters spends her entire time mugging and winking in a look, Ma, I'm acting! fashion and being far too aware of the audience. This is not something that is typical of stage productions  heaven knows--I have been a regular attendee of many productions at the Stratford Festial for many years and stage actors do NOT behave in that fashion as a rule (at least those who want to continue to find regular employment do not!)...<br /><br />Betsy Joslyn. Oh dear  oh dear  oh dear. Did anybody besides me notice that she can't sing this role even vaguely appropriately? And her playing George Hearn's daughter is just creepy  considering that she was married to him at the time. Isn't she supposed to be a sweet little sixteen-year-old? Yes  I realize that this is what acting is all about  but not once did she convince me that she was any younger than about thirty-five  and the phrase mutton dressed as lamb seems to have been coined just for her. Her butchering of Green Finch And Linnet Bird had me gnashing my teeth and ready to turn off the DVD player at once. That song was done so well in Tim Burton's movie  and this was a sad shock. The song requires the vocal range of Julie Andrews in the 1960's and a purity of voice that is only comparable to that of a boy soprano. Any vibrato at all kills it dead  and Ms. Joslyn spent the entire time warbling so hard that I thought she was about to fall off of her ladder because she was trembling so much from the effort at sustaining coloratura notes with a voice that is a mezzo at best. Let us pass over the spectacle of her vibrating at least a quarter tone flat on at least three of the higher notes... This is quite simply not a coloratura role and perhaps a discerning director should have told her that--but the fact that she was married to the star might possibly have tied the director's hands.<br /><br />Cris Groenendaal was adequate  but again obviously far too old for the role and there is zero chemistry between him and Ms. Joslyn  which makes the whole subplot fall completely flat. I am reminded a little of past stage productions of Wagner's Ring cycle where  due to the vocal power required for the singers to bellow over the sound of a full Wagnerian orchestra they would have to cast based upon ability to penetrate vocally as opposed to any appearance or acting ability or even a good voice  which is why you have the caricature of the massive mountainous Viking-horned Brunehilde with a triple chin and a beard  when the libretto calls for an ethereal beauty who is eternally young and bewitching. The casting of the juvenile leads is exactly like that--if you close your eyes you can almost believe in Mr. Groenendaal's Anthony  but as soon as you look at the screen the illusion is shattered. (And at NO time can you ever believe in Ms. Joslyn's Johanna...) For me  the rest of the production was completely lost because of three out of the four major characters were so obviously miscast. I cannot give a proper review of anything else because they were so distracting that they spoiled the rest of the production. I really can't understand why people rave about this badly-shot and self-conscious filming of a stage play. Surely there's more to camera work in the theatre than just plunking a camera down in the front row? If I want that  I'll go to a decent play  preferably at the Stratford Festival  where at least they work together for the production and aren't constantly mugging for the camera. I give it three stars only because the quality of the production apart from the antics of Lansbury and Joslyn seems adequate if not spectacular.<br /><br />Probably the best thing one can do is buy the soundtrack of the film and a cast recording of this play  and then combine the two to make a bearable whole. That's what I'm going to do  and try to forget that I ever bothered to rent this wholly unremarkable production.",negative
This movie moved much too slowly for my taste.The concept of the story is refreshingly different in that it explores the family dynamics of living with a mentally-retarded family member in a way that I have not previously seen on-screen.However the execution of the concept was flawed.Each character was developed fully within the scene of her first appearance then one had to endure the feeling that each character was treading water the rest of the way.That is each character flailed about awkwardly in her interpersonal relationships with others in the movie which I found to be a form of emotional and social retardation.I suppose this has artistic merit given the irony that the story centers around an intellectually retarded individual surrounded by way above-average intelligence friends and family.The acting however was well-done without exception.I agree with other reviewers that the cinematography was beautiful.In summary I think the film has strong artistic merit because of the fine acting and cinematography but fails on an emotional level due to the shortcomings described.,negative
"I wasted 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before I gave up. The main character is completely clueless and astoundingly unsympathetic  but there is no humor in his blundering. As soon as he arrives in Germany  the screenwriter pulls the old there's only one room in the hotel, you'll have to share a room with a pretty girl stunt. Come on  at least you could let them develop their relationship a bit first. Watch It Happened One Night to see how to do it right--or any of a thousand movies since then.<br /><br />The acting is consistently third-rate  and the improvised dialogue should have been left on the cutting-room floor. It meanders with no plan at all  despite the fact that the film telegraphs the relationship's destination from the moment Greta is introduced.<br /><br />The first song  in the boardroom  is mildly funny but badly sung. The rest of the songs (well  to be fair  I only heard those in the first half-hour) are just pointless and awful. Most of the singers are painfully out of tune  but not in any intentionally humorous sort of way.",negative
Simply awful. I'm including a spoiler warning here only because of including a coupla jokes from the movie - there is nothing else to spoil  as it is already rotten. This dross was made during what must have been one of Sellers' For A Few Dollars More periods  when he'd participate in any crap for a few bucks. I'd seen this as a 15-year- old high school student in 1972  and loathed it then. No need to view it again; after 35 years I remember it now as one of the top five worst movies I'd seen as a kid. As I recall  Sellers had more of an ongoing cameo role than a lead here  but even his presence couldn't ameliorate the stale jokes  lame plot  and infantile repartee. One ongoing theme revolves around Sellers' use of his fingers: In one scene  he holds up his open hand to a group of medicos  and by folding down his fingers  enumerates the groups for which a hospital exists - the interns  the nurses  the administrators  etc. - until only his middle finger is left up  whereupon he says ...and the patients! Har Har. In another scene  to avoid costly lab tests  he dips a finger into a urine sample and sticks it into his mouth to check for sugar  then exhorts the interns gathered around him to do the same  which they do. He then advises them that he'd placed his middle finger in the urine  but sucked on the index finger  and admonishes them to pay attention. Hee Hee. (The only reason that I remember this  and this movie  and am writing this review  is that a friend told me an even dumber version of this 'joke' today). If yu laik thiss  you gonna luv dis movey. If not  see 'Hospital'  with George C. Scott (came out the same year  1972) for some genuine  marvelous black medical humor. Better yet  read 'The House of God'  by Samuel Shem  and if you can  see the movie version of it  which has never been released (please make a copy and send it to me - I'd love to finally see it).,negative
"Two things are always signs that you`re going to be watching a bad movie :<br /><br />1 ) If you`re instantly reminded of other movies like THE TERMINATOR  HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER during the title sequence <br /><br />2 ) If there`s a death during a sex scene straight after the title sequence<br /><br />There`s actually a third warning sign and that`s a caption indicating lazy exposition warning the poor ignorant naive audience of the dangers of corporate greed . Guess what ? CYBORG 2 starts with a caption warning us of corporate greed in the future   followed by a title sequence that reminded me of THE TERMINATOR   HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER followed by a death during a sex scene ! Hey you don`t suppose I`ll be watching a bad movie by any chance ? <br /><br />As you can guess this is a bad movie . It`s basically a series of action scenes written around a thread bare plot of a cyborg on the run from a greedy corporate company . It`s badly written   directed and acted and most especially it`s badly lit which means it`s very difficult to see what`s happening on screen   though I`m not entirely sure this is actually a bad thing . The only interest to be had is that it`s the film debut of Angelina Jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and who says the prophetic line  They`re lovely , I wonder if they`re real ?  which is something I ask myself whenever I see one of her movies",negative
Cybrog 2:Glass Shadow stars Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with kicks!) a karate instructor who helps a Cash (Jolie) escape from Pinwheel  her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company. Along the way Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd show up to displace the duo  while Jack Palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run. One of the things that is quite shocking about the Cyborg franchise  is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (Don't know her? Well she was in a bunch of 70's pornos) this one has Jack Palance  Elias Koteas Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third one has William Katt  Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay so  Cyborg 3's cast isn't that impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3  but I did see this on Sci-Fi channel and must admit I wasn't impressed. Actually strike that  Cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie  it's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye. However Cyborg 1 was the same way  indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style  slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye. Unfortunately like the first  this one doesn't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom  so for various reasons the movie doesn't have much to offer beyond it's look. Another aspect is the terrible acting. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie isn't much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance come off fine but seriously Palance is playing a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor. I guess on the positive side you can't accuse Michael Schroeder of not being ambitious with casting. Still the movie is dull and I for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in. Also why did they tie it in with Cyborg anyway? It has nothing to do with it's predecessor  which this manages to be worse than.<br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad),negative
This movie is a cyborg in and of itself: half nonsense/half Lifetime Original Movie.<br /><br />As a cyborg  this movie has but one objective: to make you wish that you had spent the duration of the film in a dark room punching yourself in the testicles.<br /><br />Unlike many people  I did not rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie(I'll explain why I rented it shortly). I am not a big fan of Ms. Jolie's  though I will say that her performance was stellar! Her blank stare and robotic acting really did have me believing that she was an android hooker. If anyone has a clip of her on 'Inside the Actor's Studio' explaining how she prepared for this role  please send it my way. I'll make sure to use it when I try James Lipton for Crimes against Integrity.<br /><br />So what drove me to rent this movie? One would think that it was the hope of seeing Angelina Jolie's nipples  but it wasn't. No  the reason behind this rental rested solely on one of the images on the cover of the DVD; that of Jack Palance's face! HALF OF HIS FACE WAS ROBOTIC! When I saw that  I imagined legions of Palances slowly marching through a fiery wasteland  laying waste to any humans that were foolish enough to resist. In my mind's eye  every member of this Unholy Army of Palances had a red  glowing eye; a red  glowing eye that looked at humans and saw only meat. They were to be the Architects of Oblivion...a cold  steely Apocalypse...a Nightmare from which Humanity would never awaken. It's a beautiful image that I will cherish till the end of my years.<br /><br />Like most things in my life  the actual movie did not live up to my expectations. No  there was only 'one' Jack Palance  and the only visible cybernetic enhancements that he had were located on his legs. Sadly  those enhancements didn't really enhance anything. That is unless  you count WALKING LIKE A POLIO VICTIM as a super power. At least their was a scene where Jack--grinning like a trigger-happy Alzheimer's patient--got to shoot the hell out of some people. I was waiting for him to yell  I'm damn tired of paying too much for prescription medication! Unfortunately  any outbursts of geriatric rage were few and far between.<br /><br />What the movie did have an abundance of was a poorly developed love story about a man(Elias Koteas  a.k.a. poor man's De Niro) and a cyborg(Angelina Jolie  a.k.a. Demon Spawn of John Voigt). Oh man  can the love between a Romeo of Flesh and a Juliet of Silicon ever be able to last?!?!?! It can if you follow Jack Palance's simple advice: You have to TASTE each other's TIME.<br /><br />Yeah  I'm not sure what that means. However  I am sure that I do not want Jack Palance to be the one to explain it to me. I sure as heck don't want him to show me! As an experiment  I suggest that you ask your significant other if he/she thinks that we have reached a level in our relationship where we can begin to TASTE each other's TIME?,negative
As a sci-fi and casual Angelina Jolie fan  I thought this obviously low-budget movie might be worth a look... maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults. Plus  it might be interesting to watch Angelina as she was embarking on her star-bound career.<br /><br />Oh how wrong I was. One thing I learned -- at 18  Angelina Jolie couldn't act. So  to make her comfortable  the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldn't act. Seeing this  Jack Palance (who can actually act) decided to overact. Watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes out.<br /><br />To the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script  insipid dialog  bottom-of-the-barrel cinematography... in fact add bottom-of-the-barrel everything.<br /><br />The story features Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin. She escapes the corporate HQ with the help of her combat instructor. The corporation sends bounty hunters after them. Stupid stuff happens. The end. I would tell you more but I didn't want to waste my life watching this dreck.<br /><br />I implore you -- this is not worth watching. Its not even worth thinking about watching. Save yourself the pain and move on.,negative
It's a kinder  gentler Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action  when it is there  is decent and Jack Palance  Elias Koteas  and Angelina Jolie are always dependable. It's the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible Jean Claude Van Damme film  or is that the capper to the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused about that. Either way  there was really no need for this movie. What was there a need for? Angelina Jolie. She may play an assassin robot that can explodes mid-coitus  but  what a way to go and even though this is her first movie  she still has the presence that made her an award winner.,negative
I don't get it! The teenage leads in Horror Star supposedly all are devoted horror fans  yet when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) passes away  they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it  like disco-dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it. That doesn't sound like something real horror fans would do  now does it? I'm a big horror fan and I immensely idolize departed icons like Vincent Price  Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff  but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory. No wonder Conrad comes back from the dead  admittedly  after a séance  to wipe them all off the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff already wasn't known for his friendliness in life  since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions  and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego. Even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets. Horror Star (a.k.a. Frightmare and Body Snatchers) is a pretty lame 80's horror flick  but there are a handful of cheesy & gory highlights to enjoy. The film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot  since no one  not even a film school student  is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think he'll get away with it  and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through. Conrad's video-speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension  but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive. One teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence. In the absolute messiest sequence  a poor girl' head is crushed by a coffin. Writer/director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister. The locations and scenery are great  but Vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing-job. The acting performances are overall decent  with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs delivering the most memorable roles. Horror Star can hardly be called a must-see or even a good film  but it's worth tracking down in case you're an admirer of enthusiastically made B-horror.,negative
I kind of had somewhat high expectations for this movie. I've always thought that Tom Selleck's lesser known movies (ie Runaway and Coma)  where well above the ones he had more press for. Maybe the producers should have had a little more knowledge about former major league baseball players who became stars overseas. The majority were players too good for triple a baseball  but not exactly major league matériel. I admire the idea of putting Selle's's character in Japn  versus the cliché of having play in the minors. Sad to say  this movie  much like the title of the post  is stranded at third by a movie that seems to be running on autopilot. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel  and hopefully  the producers would learn from the mistakes. The premise is just way too unique to be left alone with this uneven flick,negative
This movie stinks majorly. The only reason I gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming. It's total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings. This is by far THE worse anime that came out of Japan. I can't believe they actually put their names on this garbage. What a rip off selling this thing for $20. If you haven't seen this don't bother. If you have  I pity you.,negative
I'd have to agree with the previous reviewer: This film has awesome animation  but has problems throughout the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Plot holes are huge  dialog barely explains the concepts of the plot--the MAIN PLOT POINTS aren't even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film. The characters state the obvious  while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film. There are characters that pop up and have importance in the storyline that are never explained--most of them have names that are only mentioned *once*  and it is exceedingly confusing to a viewer.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this movie. Unless you are in it for a good laugh and how DUMB it is.,negative
It's perfectly ok that people dies in an animation  but there are just way too many death in this one. Start from the very beginning  the story is all around battles  fights  death  and revenge. It goes on and on for entire one and a half hour. It was interesting at the beginning  but I grew very tire after before the show was half way through. Unlike other animations  this one is lack of humor. There are not many interactions between the characters either. The good thing about it is the sword fight scene looks pretty good and the characters look nice.,negative
Well OK  I've seen Wrath of the Ninja.<br /><br />It isn't something that I would recommend to people who aren't seriously into japanese fighting movies. This is a sort of japanese fighting ninja movie  with a complex plot. It's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 Swords of Sorcery. I saw the subtitled version (NOT recommended by the way  it's easy to miss something) and I didn't really keep up with it all. It had some good scenes tough  but in general  it wasn't much to my liking.,negative
Hard up  No proper jobs going down at the pit  why not rent your kids! DIY pimp story without the gratuitous sex scenes  either hard core or soft core  therefore reads like a public information film from the fifties  give this a wide miss  use a barge pole if you can.,negative
This ultra-low budget kitchen-sink yawn is the kind of film that can only be made in the UK in that  anywhere else in the world the fact the a market would need to exist before a green-light would be given. Most probably self funded this is clearly an attempt to redress important issues but ultimately undermines its point of existence in that the question needs to be begged  who would ever put money into distributing this and secondly if a market audience doesn't exist to watch  buy or rent this film  why would anyone bother in the first place? My opinions may sound unfairly harsh on a first time director but  this is the kind of film that only goes to undermine the commercial viability and quality standards which have only just kept a British film industry in existence.

First of all  I just wanna say that I'm a very big Naruto fan. I love the Anime and the Manga stories. Also  the first movie just confirmed that Naruto is all about great fun  great action  great story  ... But then came the 2nd movie. I was very hyped because the first movie turned out great. But it didn't satisfy me one bit... The story was lame  action wasn't all that great... especially compared to the Anime series... same goes for the quality of animation. I found it very poorly... Could the story get any lamer... ANY ??? Where's the kyuubi of Naruto ?? Not once does he turn demon... I mean ... COME ON !!! My advice is... see the series ( until episode 140   then it's just fillers ) and then read the Manga because that's still great. Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future...<br /><br />All and all I gave it a 4  just because it's Naruto...,negative
I struggle to see the point of this movie. It is supposed to be a comedy but I didn't laugh once. The storyline is one that could have been interesting in a well made movie  but since this is acted by comics  the result is totally unbelievable (as comedies should be). The Comic strip series was very hit and miss  even withing the episodes  and it is fair to say all of the people involved have gone on to do greater things. One to avoid. I have also just found out that comments have to be 10 lines long. The whole point of these comments is to give an indication of whether the movie is worth watching: not write an essay gushing about it or taking it apart. If you like: Seinfeld  Larry Sanders  the Young Ones  Alan Partridge  Arrested Development  Curb  Red Dwarf  then you might like to pass on this. On the other hand  if you like lame jokes such as can be found in Friends and Dodgeball  enjoy watching this!,negative
1983's Frightmare is an odd little film. The director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic '30s/'40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then-exploding '80s slasher genre. It isn't totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints  and the less-than-professional caliber of its cast of young actors) but it still has its moments  mostly due to the classy performance (classier than the movie deserves) by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne  who plays an aging old time horror movie star (ala Vincent Price) named Conrad Ratzoff. At the beginning of the movie we meet the has-been horror star as he's shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol' Conrad is a bit of a hoity-toity  prima donna jerk-off. Just when you think he couldn't be any more un-likable  the commercial director berates Conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death. Nice  huh? Conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club  unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die. Still feisty even at Death's door  he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself. Conrad is then laid to rest in true Hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket  which will play personal video messages from Conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects.<br /><br />It is at this point that the kids from the college Horror Movie Society decide to pay Conrad's grave an after hours visit  breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party. (Not exactly my idea of fun  but hey  these are characters in an '80s horror film. Logic has no place here.) The college kids spend the evening having dinner with Conrad's body seated in a place of honor  posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it  before parking Conrad and his coffin in the attic  planning to return him to his crypt in the morning. In the meantime  Mrs. Ratzoff  distraught over the theft of her husband's body  has called in a psychic friend to try and reach Conrad through a seance. You can pretty much figure out the rest from here. Since Conrad wasn't a very nice guy in life  it's not much of a stretch to assume that he won't be any friendlier in death. Psychic Lady makes contact with Conrad and he re-awakens in predictably ticked off fashion  then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students' ridiculously huge house  picking off the young grave robbers one by one. This is where the movie falls apart. Endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying Hello? Is anyone there? are intercut with occasional bursts of violence (we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene  which is the highlight of the movie) before the last two survivors finally figure out (WAY later than any semi-intelligent people would have figured out the same thing...but again  we're in an '80s horror film!) that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get Conrad's body back to its crypt where it belongs. The sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music(thunder  moans and groans  howls  etc.) that becomes severely annoying after a while.<br /><br />I can't really recommend Frightmare to anyone who didn't grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the '80s. Modern Horror fans will doubtlessly find Frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy. If you came of age in that magical decade  however  you may get a blast of nostalgia from Frightmare. Fans of Jeffrey (Re-Animator) Combs may also want to check it out  as the future Dr. West appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students.<br /><br />I will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the EastWestDVD label (paired with Roy Ward's Vault of Horror and sold at dollar stores) because the print quality is terrible. I'm told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at Troma  which seems appropriate. If you're a Troma kind of person then Frightmare will be right up your alley.,negative
The Comic Strip featured actors from 'The Young One's' - a student based sitcom from the 80's. Comic Strip features included parodies of westerns  'The famous 5'  and The Professionals - all a lot funnier than this. Having said that Alexei Sayle puts in a good turn as a traffic cop with ambition and the soundtrack features great music from the era. 5/10,negative
The basic story idea of ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent--two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To further defray costs  they get two other strangers to come along. What makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular  showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life. Unfortunately  this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous. Her doe-eyed expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isn't a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot! And to make it worse  Reginald Owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that I was very close to turning off the film--he was that awful and unbelievable. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10--which is very  very difficult to understand. Sure  the film has great ambiance and a good plot  but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture. Sorry  but this film was aching for a re-make!,negative
"The 1935 version of Enchanted April manages to be simultaneously tedious<br /><br />and perfunctory. It is difficult to show the transformative magic of Italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical Italian behavior to belabor. The transformation of the four strangers fleeing London is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later. Rather than develop  the screenplay flips a switch and the<br /><br />characters are different.<br /><br />The husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up  even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and/or hostilities.<br /><br />Jessie Ralph has the most fun (moving instead of entirely chewing up the<br /><br />scenery) and Katharine Alexander has some poignant charm out of her<br /><br />husband's shadow (and away from his hideous droning). Ann Harding is<br /><br />unremarkable here (with the Production Code being enforced). She had an<br /><br />appropriate line in an earlier (pre-Code) movie  When Ladies Meet: You're<br /><br />not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you, but in Enchanted April can only look hurt  rush out  and proclaim fealty to her errant husband.",negative
I found this to be a tremendously disappointing version of a charming story. I thought the acting was on the whole quite good. Reginald Owen did chew the scenery  as mentioned by others  but I found him moderately amusing in his brief scenes. TCM has made an Ann Harding fan of me  and I thought she was fine as usual here. Jessie Ralph had a field day as the old battleaxe  ordering everybody around  and Frank Morgan  as always  played Frank Morgan with a twinkle.<br /><br />For me  the problem was the script and/or the editing--transitions were awkward  motivations were murky. The movie was just too darned short to convey the story properly! I felt completely let down  particularly since I had such fond memories of the later version.,negative
Enchanted April was one of Harry Beaumont's last movies- he only directed a few more after this one. He had made the Maisie movies in the 1930s and 1940s. In the opening credits  it says From the novel by Elizabeth  and completely leaves off the author's last name... rather odd  but since it was von Armin  they may not have wanted the German association at the time... Sad to hear it was a flop when it was released  with those fun names like Frank Morgan (the Wizard) and Jessie Ralph  who played W.C. Fields' disapproving mother- in- law in Bank Dick. Two gals in London (Ann Harding & Katharine Alexander) decide to rent a castle to host two of their friends  but things don't go the way they planned. Reginald Owen plays the husband with multiple personalities. Aside from a few funny moments  it DOES move pretty slow. Ralph is the only bright spot here  as the overbearing take-charge type  and the picture is quite fuzzy and out of focus for much of the film. The views of Italy are all obvious backdrops. The only saving grace here is that the Turner Classic version is only 66 minutes long. Too bad they didn't give Frank Morgan a larger role. This was remade in 1992 by the BBC as a British Film.,negative
I had been delighted to find that TCM was showing this  as I love the 1992 version with Josie Lawrence  Jim Broadbent  Joan Plowright...This film had a luminous Ann Harding  a wonderful performance by Frank Morgan  but others' acting made the film more of a farce then the wonderful unfolding that the later film. Reginald Owen's Arbuthnot is painful to watch and you can't understand why his wife adores him. I found out after watching the film that it was based on the stage play where the 1992 film is based on the book. The original film also felt like it was a snippet of a larger piece and felt incomplete. Too bad it was such a let-down.,negative
I wish I knew what to make of a movie like this. It seems to be divided into two parts -- action sequences and personal dramas ashore. It follows Ashton Kutsher through survival swimmer school  guided by Master Chief Kevin Costner  then to Alaska where a couple of spectacular rescues take place  the last resulting in death.<br /><br />I must say that the scenes on the beach struck me as so stereotypical in so many ways that they should be barnacle encrusted. A typical bar room fight between Navy guys and Coast Guardsmen (puddle pirates). The experienced old timer Costner who is  as an elderly bar tender tells him  married to the Coast Guard. The older chief who keeps trying to prove to himself that he's still nineteen. The neglected ex wife ashore to whom Kostner pays a farewell visit. The seemingly sadistic demands placed on the swimmers by the instructors  all in pursuit of a loftier goal. The gifted young man hobbled by a troubled past.<br /><br />The problem is that we've seen it all before. If it's Kevin Costner here  it's Clint Eastwood or John Wayne or Lou Gosset Jr. or Vigo Mortenson or Robert DeNiro elsewhere. And the climactic scene has elements drawn shamelessly from The Perfect Storm and Dead Calm. None of it is fresh and none of the old stereotyped characters and situations are handled with any originality.<br /><br />It works best as a kind of documentary of what goes on in the swimmer's school and what could happen afterward and even that's a little weak because we don't get much in the way of instruction. It's mostly personal conflict  romance  and tension about washing out.<br /><br />It's a shame because the U. S. Coast Guard is rather a noble outfit  its official mission being the safety of lives and property at sea. In war time it is transferred to the Navy Department and serves in combat roles. In World War II  the Coast Guard even managed to have a Medal of Honor winner in its ranks.<br /><br />But  again  we don't learn much about that. We don't really learn much about anything. The film devolves into a succession of visual displays and not too much else. A disappointment.,negative
The final installment in the Karate Kid series is predictable  poorly acted  and so bad it borders on the enjoyable. But not quite  it's just bad. In this installment Ralph Macchio's Karate Kid is absent  already having been in one too many of the episodes. The new Kid  played by Hillary Swank  is the teenage granddaughter of one of Mr. Miyogi's WWII buddies. Her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hellion. In steps Mr. Miyogi to set things right. True to formula  there is a group of neo-Fascist bullies  called the Alpha Troopers that must be put in their place and a new karate move  called the Praying Mantis. As I said before this movie is a mess  and should be avoided.,negative
"In 1984  The Karate Kid had some charm to it  even if it was little more than a poor man's Rocky. Alas  producer Jerry Weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended  and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the definitive low in the franchise  yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential. What other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid?<br /><br />Wait a minute. Next? Yep  Macchio's gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually)  and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!)  playing a troubled teenager (what else?) named Julie Pierce. Now  the girl has family issues. She also gets in trouble at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). As it turns out  though  one of his students is actually a nice guy  and Julie falls for him. This gets her in bigger trouble than before  of course. Lucky for her  she is currently living with Mr. Miyagi (Morita)  an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys.<br /><br />All those factors ad up to seven clichés  and that's just a generic plot summary - imagine what the detailed scenes must be like! From beginning to end  The Next Karate Kid is a tired  flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. Swank does  thankfully  have the likes of Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem this disaster  but why did Morita accept to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first movie  and was quite enjoyable in the sequels  but has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the wax on, wax off gag is stillborn. As for Ironside  he is slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III  but that's hardly a stretch.<br /><br />So  is this picture really that awful? Not exactly. There is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty  but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of Asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives  it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest.",negative
They missed up the film when the tried to use some one diffrent. They should of keeped Ralph Macchio as Danny instead of changing it. And made more Karate Kids with him in it.And also many people were woundering what happen to Danny when they jumped from 3 to 5 and no four.,negative
This film is so bad. I mean  who commissions this stuff? And the costume designer deserves an award for making everyone look like they had just stepped out of 1983. A bloke puts a female wig on and fights....nuff said.,negative
I am truly sad that this is the first bad review I've ever made for a movie...EVER.I could stand to watch this movie  and it is the second movie in all the movies I've seen that is just...a downgrade. The first is Open Water  that just had NO point whatsoever. The Next Karate Kid didn't have any mention of Daniel(correct me if I'm wrong  please.) and that ending line came as a shock. It was like  If must fight...win. then it showed the bird flying around and the pan flute was playing  and I was like  oh. Okay  so it'll take a while for this next part. AND THEN THE CREDITS HIT THE SCREEN.<br /><br />GEEZ MAN!! Hopefully  I will never have to review a movie in a bad manner again  I apologize for those of you who like The Next Karate Kid  I really  really do...,negative
I thought maybe... maybe this could be good. An early appearance by the Re-Animator (Jeffery Combs); many homage's to old horror movies; the Troma label on the front this movie could be a gem! I thought wrong.<br /><br />Frightmare is a boring  overplayed  half assed homage to the fright films of yore. The story is an old one  young people breaking into a house  getting drunk  making love  and tampering with things that shouldn't be tampered with. The oft  recycled slasher film formula is used here  this time with a thought to be dead actor named Conrad Radzoff doing the killing. In fact  the performance by the Radzoff's actor Ferdy Mayne is the only redeeming quality of this film. He does the snooty Dracula style character very well. But as for the kids  its not so good  with Combs only having a minimal part.<br /><br />The film lacks entertainment value  and only features one cool character  and one or two scenes that can hold your attention. I do not recommend this film unless you are desperate for something to watch  and this is the only movie left at blockbuster.,negative
I can accept the fact this was the NEXT karate kid so Ralph Macchio can be happily retired from the series  and while Hillary Swank is great for the role....the plot to the movie is just dreadful.<br /><br />Mr. Miyagi's old buddy from World War 2 dies  leaving his widow to take care of her rebellious grand-daughter when her parents die in an accident. The girl has no discipline yet is the hero because the local ROTC...which I'll explain in a minute  has it out to get her. You know the drill...Miyagi takes her under his wing and in the end they beat the bad guys and everyone lives happily ever after.<br /><br />Its hokey  its cheesy  its the 90's....but that's not even the long and the short of it. My first case of huh? is why is there a military division in high school? I thought that stuff went out in the 1960's  especially in a public school. As much as Michael Ironside kicks booty in his role as the main heel  since when is military involved in a high school? My next gripe is that during the prom scene  the militants bungee jump to scare the crap out of people....why? The thing I noticed throughout all 4 movies was at the very end the heels suddenly turn face after all the nonsense they put the main character through (Billy in part 1  Sato in part 2  Kreese in part 3). This movie is no different. After Ned and cronies basically sabotage the senior prom  blow up Eric's car and threaten Hillary Swank the whole movie.....Ironside tells them to beat her up and they're like um...no If you're gonna do pathetic face turns  at least make sure the characters haven't done anything too over the top such as blowing up a hot rod.<br /><br />As for the rest of the love plot between Eric and Hillary Swank....corny but nothing to melodramatic  which is a breath of fresh air from the garbage Ralph Macchio pulled in the first 3 movies.<br /><br />I will say for its own movie  after watching the first 3 movies  I can accept it being more or less a spin off...but I can't accept the whole military thing  way too uncommon for it to be taken seriously. Now if Ironside and crew was a wrestling/football team and he was the coach  THAT would have been more believable.<br /><br />Ironside and Morita deliver the goods  Swank is OK...the rest are the same as anything  the one highlight is when they blow up the hot rod  THAT was cool 4 out of 10,negative
"Hillary Swank is an unattractive piece of work in this unattractive piece of work of a film. Pat Morita  desperate for work  any kind of work  agreed to reprise his role as the Karate teacher and bring his brand of Karate to the silver screen once again  except this time  Hillary skank Swank is the student.<br /><br />I can just see the Hollywood writers getting excited about the idea of having a tormented, spoiled brat female take the role from Ralph. The film does not work on any level and it's boring on every level. There's nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for anyone to hold on to. The film was made without any thought of making money because it's just so bad.<br /><br />I would gladly spit on all the actors in this film for having been involved with it and have the writers black-listed for their miserable and insulting efforts.",negative
The Next Karate Kid is a thoroughly predictable movie  just like its predecessors. Its predictability often results in a feeling of impatience on the viewer's part  who often wishes the story could move a little faster. Despite its lulls and its extreme familiarity  however  this fourth entry in the series is painless  almost exclusively because of the presence of Morita. He doesn't seem tired of his role  and he does inject some life and humor into the film  becoming the best reason for you to see it. Not awful  but nothing much  either.,negative
I thought this movie was going to be a disgrace to the series. After all  part 3 didn't measure up to part 2  and this one doesn't have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humour wasn't quite as witty in this one as in part 3  but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching.<br /><br />The girl's part was pretty good. She's a lost teenager who needs direction. I find the plot a little hard to believe. That the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi  a man she just met. Of course  he was a friend of her brother.<br /><br />I did appreciate the monastery. One might think from some of my other reviews that I wouldn't have liked the dancing monks  but I thought it was amusing. It showed that they know how to have some fun. Now if these were monks in ancient China dancing to pop-music  that would have been another matter.<br /><br />Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug. Miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid  nations trying to destroy each other is stupid  but having respect for all life is not stupid. Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well.<br /><br />I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Sure  there were some things I liked about it. It wasn't as funny as part three  and no character could ever live up to Sato in part 2. This movie has no re-watch value. I can't imagine watching it again  but it is worth seeing once.,negative
Young spinster  who doesn't associate with women her own age and is eyed by gentleman from the retirement set  invites an apparently mute young man into her apartment on a rainy day. Nervous and overly-polite to hide her own sexual insecurities  she is most pleased when the boy makes himself to home in her guest bedroom...but not so happy when he begins sneaking out the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not a hapless actress  but why she was attracted to these sad-sack roles I guess we'll never know. Based on a book by Richard Miles  and about as far removed from a commercial drama as one could get  this lurid material not only attracted Dennis but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static  at best). The narrative seems almost a sex-reversal of The Collector  a tag which may have sold the film-rights but which doesn't turn out to be a good idea cinematically. Even the film's best sequence (Dennis shopping for a prostitute to satisfy her prisoner) doesn't quite come off  with Sandy acting both ill and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is quite good as the kid who uses this frumpy  pasty-sick woman just for her comfy digs  but he's handled too bashfully by Altman  with lots of strategically-placed towels and flesh-colored undies (Altman clearly wasn't ready for a mature picture with adult themes at this point). Sandy Dennis has a handful of very good scenes; she doesn't chatter away mindlessly here  she thinks before she speaks and she's alarmingly careful in her actions. Unfortunately  the role itself is a bummer  with an apparent slide into mental deterioration which seems to happen off-screen. As such  the abrupt finale is maddening  and the overall results tepid. *1/2 from ****,negative
The screenplay is the worst part of this film  as it lurches from one premise to the next  missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible. (This film is confusing  because the audience doesn't know what the story is.) I had no problem with the low-production values and the acting wasn't great  but this is telly  so it was fine. I don't mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take. But having such a non-sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary. Did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash? Avoid this at all costs.<br /><br />The prologue in particular was so poorly written  it needed a voice-over to fill in all the details that had been left out. The prologue was rushed  it wasn't clear what was happening  ie. The Russian Revolution was reduced to Some riots are happening in Petersburg  with the next scene being soldiers arresting them. I know the basic history of the Revolution  so I could fill in the details  those pesky Communists. The prologue is best ignored.<br /><br />This could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is. It sets up this premise in the asylum. It could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film. No. Gone. The film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.) It sets up a melodramatic romance  a love so strong  it'll believe anything she says. Okay  a soppy romance. No  because it makes no sense. The love interest seems like a crazed (and incidentally  sleazy) lunatic  bursting out in wild gestures. This also doesn't work  because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never got married and she returned to America. The love story collapses. Despite there being plenty of love scenes  I was never convinced of the reason that they were in love. I find rom-com romances more convincing  despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they've even spent any time with each other.<br /><br />It could have been a thriller-type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is  and she struggles to prove her identity. No  the court case is summed up rather than dealt with. The bizarre voice over comes back  again to fill in the details of a better film.<br /><br />The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married another loony and they did crazy things together. Throughout her life  she had bouts of lunatic behaviour. None of this in the film either. There's a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next/'Twelve Monkeys'-type informant. Thankfully  she vanishes  having brought nothing to the story.,negative
The Man with Bogart's Face sets it self up to mine the viewers nostalgia for the late 30's-late 40's film era. It fails miserably for several reasons. First  Sacchi  while looking reasonably like Bogart and even speaking like him on occassion and using his mannerisms  completely lacks any of Bogart's charisma or acting ability. This is really apparent whenever Sacchi is not clearly imitating a scene from one of Bogart's films. Second  the film does not have the first rate character actors Bogart was able to work with. There are no Peter Lorre's or Sydney Greenstreet's in this one  folks. Sure we are treated to performances by Victor Buaeno  Olivia Hussey and George Raft amongst others  but they just aren't of the same caliber (or aren't given enough screen time or are miscast). Third  the attempts at modern humor all fall through. All of the underwear jokes  having Marlowe almost *never* remove that damn hat and trench coat (even though Bogart would have)  etc. just aren't funny and really pull down this film. Fourth  I've never heard a goofier theme song this side of Mitchell. Finally  the film's false reverence for Bogart (and other classic actors work) is truly irritating. Bogart almost *never* played a straight hero  on those occasions he was a hero. He played complicated characters. This movie makes Bogart out to be a trigger-happy  moralistic do-gooder. While this may have been true about some film characters  Bogart's characters rarely fit that bill. It's movies like this that make people unexposed to the cinema of the past think that all of it is hokey  good guy beats the bad guys and gets the girl crap with low production values.,negative
This movie should have been called The Eyes of Alexander  and they should have done away with the Bogart concept altogether. The film started out with a lighthearted approach to Bogart's legacy and some comical moments with his surgery oriented face  but after the first 15-30 minutes it morphs into a more serious thriller  where two palm size sapphires  purportedly laid as eyes into a marble headpiece of Alexander the Great  for him  and seen by him  right before his death. So the gems are of great value not only because of their quality and size  but also because of the tie to the Greatest conquerer the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that this is wholly and completely a fiction  but it makes for a good movie anyway. So the film winds around some early silliness and stumbles along with all sorts of Alexander allusions in both the foreground and background (which I really liked)  ending with a dated shark attack (you couldn't go to a movie in '79-'80 without some shark showing up to menace the audience). There is a yacht named Euridice (Alexander's father's young wife)  a man named Alexander  Philip  Cleitus?  (it's been about 5 years since I've seen the film  so can't remember all the details)  Olympias  some street names  and many others. It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the background details that the director (obviously an Alexanderphile himself) put in. When all is said and done  the eyes are retrieved and the camera pans in on them on a bed as the credits roll by. Kind of a neat ending. What would have been more fun would be if they went the Indiana Jones way and had an action adventure. There were many  many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting  or instance  the hand-annotated (by Aristotle) version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life  even on his many journeys across Asia (would be of incalculable value if found today). Olivia Hussey (my all time favorite b-movie actress)is killed off way too early  and should have been the main actress throughout  not the girl from the Momma's and the Poppa's...though she was herself easy on the eyes. If you can find this flick  it might be worth checking out for the historical stuff and to see Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny deadpan humor bit early on  but beyond that  I'd pass on it for something more entertaining.<br /><br />Yours  Nick,negative
This show should be titled  When Bad Writing Happens To Good Actors considering most of the players have demonstrated immense talent in other venues  e.g. Andre Braugher in Homicide: Life on the Street and David Morse in St. Elsewhere. I'm hoping that the frenetic pacing of the show is adjusted as the series develops along with the obvious cliches and dialogue so absurd I wondered just how stupid the writers imagined the core audience to be. We're beat over the head with the main points of this show instead of being left to gradually figure it out  almost as if the writers feel that they must spell out that the main character is some sort of avenging angel  sentenced to redeem himself from sins  both venial and mortal  via butting into his cab fares many affairs. Watching the premiere required much suspension of disbelief  that Mike Olshanskey's fares would so rapidly spill their guts and he would feel driven to intervene in the lives of utter strangers. That he possesses those Super-Cop abilities  to be all things to all people  weapons expert  martial arts master  psychologist  father-confessor  locksmith  and so on  ad infinitum. Pure drivelesque fantasy. What is it about recent televisions shows based in Philidelphia that they all seem to be imbued with a nasty ex-wife and a very disrepectfully bratty child? Overdone. I wanted to like this show  really I did  because it had the virtue of having a premise slightly different than many of the clones appearing in this season's fare and it stars some of my preferred actors. But I'm afraid this is just another possibly good idea ruined by careless execution.,negative
Done in a mock-documentary style  late 60's subversives and supposed detractors of the mainstream government are arrested and given a choice. Upon sentencing for their wrong doings there is a choice of going to prison for 7 years to life or spending three days and two nights in a southern California desert at Punishment Park. In the 100 degree heat  the prisoners are to trek fifty some odd miles to an American flag for their freedom. US and state law enforcers will follow two hours latter. If the dissidents are captured it means prison.<br /><br />Appearing in this pseudo-documentary: Carmen Argenziano  Katherine Quittner  Mary Ellen Kleinhall  Stan Armsted  Scott Turner  Patrick Boland and Kent Foreman.,negative
Committed doom and gloomer Peter Watkins goes slummin' across the pond to take on the American justice system circa 1971 with this priceless piece of zeitgeist paranoia that leans so far left it falls over constantly. Watkins is pure tourist as he assembles this our gang tragedy with cliché freaks  hippies and black revolutionaries pitted against trigger happy cops and military and a kangaroo court tribunal made up of disapproving calcified adults making poor fashion statements. Talk about a revolution.<br /><br />In Punishment Park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as dissenters convicted of crimes are given the choice of imprisonment or a three day trek across Punishment Park (Death Valley) and freedom. Of course the law enforcement officials monitoring their journey aren't about to play fair and combined with the stifling heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealed.<br /><br />Punishment Park has elements of Kafka in setting as well as theme. Trials are held under a large canvas tent where shackled prisoners shout defiance at a hardcore love it or leave it group of inquisitors (such as members of Silent Majority for a Peaceful America) who snarl back. Neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look. Mostly its just one side saying what's wrong with America the other saying what's right with no one offering solutions for change. Meanwhile the Punishment Park martyrs stumble endlessly about the dessert while cops with guns act like twelve year olds. It kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70's college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do now.<br /><br />Peter Watkins has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he perceives as a corrupt powerful few. Culledon was a strong indictment of military atrocity in 18th century Scotland that still resonates. War Game is a raw sobering look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all. Punishment Park has its value as well but for other than intended reason. Watkins vision today is a textbook example of the left in full tilt counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times ( Vietnam  Kent State  The Chicago 7) such strident hysteria seemed not that great a distance from the truth. But 35 years later the fever has subsided and Punishment Park with it's unrestrained narrow viewpoint is a pretty silly ride.,negative
I loved the first 15 minutes  and I loved some of the dialogue in the tribunal--which proved to be the best showcase for the director's ahead-of-its-time method acting technique--but this movie ultimately disappoints. Even when viewed purely as a metaphor of the oppressor/oppressed dynamics that were and are prevalent in the relationship between the US government and its more disobedient citizens  it still lacks punch and believability  and ultimately left me looking at my watch hoping the obvious ending would happen already.<br /><br />And for the record: despite rampant rumors to the contrary  this movie has never been banned in the US (I can't comment on the rumors of UK censorship  but I'm suspicious). Hollywood refused to distribute it after its initial film festival showing  and I am more than willing to believe the Nixon government had some influence on this decision; however  the fact that it never appeared on American television is merely a reflection of this medium's rather careful and advertising-driven fashion of doing business. As for the present  you can have your very own copy of the DVD delivered to your door via Amazon in a few days.,negative
The person making taffy in this movie was so realistic. That person must have been trained so well! If I were buying taffy from the store featured in this fine romantic comedy  I would demand to be served by the guy who trained the person who played the guy selling taffy.,negative
A really funny story idea with good actors but it misses somehow. The actors are older but none of them looked particularly good. They needed better make up photography or something.It is supposed to be a love story and yet the film had more of the rough look of a street film. I liked the cast but I think the performances were rather bland. This is where the weakness of the director shows. Perhaps if Mrs. Spielberg had Mr. Spielberg directing it would have been a much better film.,negative
I liked most of the dialogue  I liked the cast  I thought it was well acted. I particularly enjoyed Ellen DeGeneres' perfect deadpan performance.<br /><br />What didn't work for me was: (1) the drawn-out affair with the younger man (too long  too seemingly out of character for Helen)  (2) the seemingly endless cinematic cliches  mostly visual but including interminable voiced over re-readings of the love letter itself (its contents should have a mystery); (3) a young woman feminist-scholar and  ironically  a fireworks scene (no wonder this reminded me of that horrid How to Make an American Quilt movie); (4) the bumbling gotcha cop who smells dope everywhere (no cliche there either!); and (5) a nauseatingly romanticized small town setting.<br /><br />I would have preferred the film to more persuasively explore the source of (or even glorify) Helen's bitterness  to have included much more of DeGeneres' character  to have eliminated or reduced the various intergenerational artifices  and to be a little less uncritical of small town life.<br /><br />Had it been developed as a play first  those criticisms might have been addressed before committing the material to this film  which unfortunately is decidedly mediocre.,negative
Don't waste your time. The plot drags  the characters are wooden and uninteresting  the motivations of their actions are completely indecipherable. Kept waiting for the romantic or comedy to occur  and nothing happened. Worse yet  the love letter isn't even romantic  but sounds like it was written by someone desperate to make a deadline. Did I mention that the plot twist which we saw coming from 15 mins into the movie was Hollywood clever  meaning it is intended to shock  but given the Hollywood mentality- does nothing of the sort  and instead is vaguely offensive.<br /><br />It's not even worth the $2 to rent. Don't bother seeing it.,negative
**Possible Spoilers**	From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan  `The Love Letter' is a romantic comedy that takes place in a picturesque  New England coastal village where single mom Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a quaint  little bookstore. One day at work  Helen happens across an anonymous letter (the `love letter' of the title) that has somehow become lodged beneath the cushions of a reading couch. Upon reading the amorous prose therein  she believes it has been written to her  purposely placed in the couch for her to find  and  for reasons of her own  thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer. Inadvertently  however  Helen leaves the letter out where her employee  Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds it  believes it to be for her  and  of course  thinks she knows who wrote it. Circumstances then bring it into the possession of a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott)  who thinks Helen has written the letter to him. And before it all gets sorted out  you can only imagine the hilarious situations into which all of those involved have been cast; and I do mean imagine  because the way this movie plays out  the audience gets little more from it than what it brings along itself. There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails miserably: It simply isn't very romantic  and it's not funny; and that is a potent combination that causes this film to misfire practically from the opening credits. Once the setting and main character (Helen) have been established  it basically goes nowhere for the next ninety minutes or so. By the time you finally find out who actually wrote the letter  and to whom  you could care less. Rounding out the cast is Tom Selleck  Blythe Danner  Julianne Nicholson  Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It's a shame to see such talent wasted on such claptrap as this  and looking bad in the balance. Kate Capshaw  who usually brightens up the screen just by showing up  looks tired here  while Selleck appears to have just come in off a three day bender that's lasted a week. Ellen DeGeneres actually comes away looking the best of the bunch. It is said that the journey is often a more heady experience than the destination. In the case of `The Love Letter ' however  it would have been best for all concerned if everybody had just stayed home in the first place. I rate this one 1/10.,negative
A movie about a mysterious love letter that puts a small town on its ear should be fun  romantic and easy-going entertainment. Instead this movie is more about things not said and not expressed  so it gets to the point where you are grateful anything is said at all  even if the dialogue is not exactly quotable. <br /><br />SPOILER --<br /><br />When the relationship that says the most is the one least seen on the screen (Danner and McEwan)  you know you're in trouble. But those two actresses are a very welcome sight in a movie screaming for some genuine people.<br /><br />END OF SPOILER<br /><br />Capshaw is given the task of creating a character from not much and she is not entirely successful. Like I said above  the theme seems to be repression and I understand that is an element of life and love but I don't want to see a movie about it either  at least not this one. <br /><br />I can't recommend this at all  despite the very talented cast who are left to fend for themselves.,negative
This is a movie about people receiving a love letter. Nobody knows who sent in and nobody knows who it is for. A good cast  headed up by Kate Capshaw  Tom Selleck and Ellen DeGeneres. This  however  is a completely dopey plot. As an example  the Capshaw character  one of the leading citizens of a small town in New England  takes up with an immature college student who works in her bookstore during the summer. She chooses him instead of Tom Selleck  the town firefighter who is crazy about her. If that isn't the epitome of stupidity  I don't know what is. Just an example of how dopey this movie is. Watching Kate Capshaw jog is a pleasure  but you immediately realize that she has never jogged a day in her life. Another obviously dopey part of a dopey movie.,negative
The Love Letter is one of those movies that could have been really clever  but they wasted it. Focusing on a letter wreaking havoc in a small town  the movie has an all-star cast with nothing to do. Tom Selleck and Alice Drummond had so recently co-starred in the super-hilarious In & Out (also about an upset in a small town)  in which they were both great  but here they look as though they're getting drug all over the place. I can't tell what the people behind the camera are trying to do here (if anything)  but they sure didn't accomplish anything. How tragic  that a potential laugh riot got so sorrowfully wasted.,negative
generally speaking I don't make negative comments on here. But since this is a festival piece  I don't want you to waste your time when you could see something else that might not be playing again.<br /><br />I thought the actors were pretty bad. For instance  they totally didn't play off each other  rather  they waited to RECITE their lines which were pretty poor to begin with. The dialogue sounded really forced. Norman or whatever his name tried  or so it would appear  to be witty and biting in the lines he chose but just fell really short.<br /><br />After words he asked if anyone saw the ending coming and some people were all yea  and he all but called them liars. Look there were so many clues  the biggest being a briefcase full of cash for a $500 an hour whore. I mean the john gave her at least 20g's... tell tale sign. Now no you couldn't see exactly what was going to happen but by the time the twist actually occurred  I for one  didn't even care. I was just glad to get out of there. I asked him which draft he shot and he said 8.1  maybe next time he will wait to shoot 'til 15.3 cause this needed a lot of work.<br /><br />But he seemed like a fairly nice guy  he is making his own films  he'll probably get better and I hope he does  not in a snotty way either  I mean it  I wish him luck. Just remember  this is just my opinion.,negative
First of all  Blythe Danner doesn't look anywhere NEAR old enough to play Capshaw's daughter (and in fact she isn't -- only ten years apart).<br /><br />I understand this is supposed to be one of those magical  Moonstruck type supernatural romances but this is beyond the pale. Very  very weak in terms of acting  script and direction. <br /><br />The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres  who makes this film watchable -- if not really believable herself as she's cast as a bit of a heterosexual sex hound. But endearing nonetheless. Actually  DeGeneres and the skin shots of the young guy Capshaw dallies with together make this watchable. But no one can really tell if Capshaw is really in love with the young guy or not; neither the script nor her acting pull it together for us and we're left to wonder how she really feels.,negative
This film is about a mysterious love letter that turned 4 people's love life upside down.<br /><br />The idea of the film is interesting  and the film could have been funny. However  this film is simply what a romantic comedy should not be. The characters are inadequately introduced at first  so it gets so confusing. The supporting characters come and go without adequate reasons  as if they exist just for one particular scene and then vanish into thin air. The pacing is awfully slow  that it makes 90 minutes seem more like 180 minutes.<br /><br />It could have been romantic and funny  but this film spectacularly failed to do either.,negative
I must be honest  I like romantic comedies  but this was not what I had hoped for. I thought Ellen Degeneres was having the biggest part  which should have been  because I didn't like the two struggling bed partners. It was awful. Poor Tom Selleck!! He had to act with someone who was that much in the picture while it should have been him and Ellen to be in most of the film. They were the only believable ones. And the only really funny parts starred them  not Kate Capshaw and that Everett guy.. Cool that mummy is coming out of the closet  I thought that was a nice surprise. <br /><br />I'm just glad I saw it on the cable and I didn't pay any money renting it..,negative
Divorced single mom in picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows it to spur into action her dormant love life. Pet project for actress/co-producer Kate Capshaw  who gives a warm  nicely-modulated lead performance  yet this story is so slim and the direction and editing so erratic that a faint dissatisfaction creeps in. Initially  Capshaw's Helen envisions several of her friends reading the love letter to her (an interesting visual joke) but the first person they do this ploy with is Ellen DeGeneres  who doesn't play a lesbian but who comes off as one because of this gimmick. Different ideas are flayed about in the hopes that one would stick  and the continuity is extremely choppy. Supporting cast (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott  who mostly acts with his shirt off) is very good  but they can't save the final act  which is disappointing. Low-keyed  in a quirky  pleasant way  but it is blandly good-natured  nothing more. **1/2 from ****,negative
I am a huge Robert Taylor fan and I have been trying to find all of his films. This is one I did not have  but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel  and was very disappointed. I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts  but the acting was as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was even bad  and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable. Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck  it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them. But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S. would order a Navy Lt to leave the service secretly to hunt down bank robbers  and report only to the President  that it made it hard to appreciate anything else about the film. The death row scenes were entirely unmoving. The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing. She got better later in Ball of Fire-thank heavens.,negative
Dorothy Provine does the opposite here: She keeps growing and growing. I didn't detect any subtext  though. The Incredible Shrinking Man and other movies of its ilk during the period were parables about radiation  nuclear war  and other horrors. Provine's growth is the result of an inept computer/robot.<br /><br />And who operates this computer but Lou Costello! I like some of his movies with Bud Abbott. But  though this is a pretty bad movie  he does fine without him. And Gale Green is an excellent foil.<br /><br />Green plays the pompous town big shot. He is Provine's father. He is intent on being elected Mayor. So when his beloved daughter starts having issues  he dumps her. He doesn't exactly dump her but gives up his battle against her longtime admirer Costello.<br /><br />This is pretty implausible: Costello is the local garbage collector.<br /><br />The special effects are minimal. And the subplot involving the military is lame in the extreme.,negative
May contain spoilers Sadly Lou Costellos' last film has the distinction of being slightly better than Abbott & Costello's last movie together Dance With Me Henry. This movie isn't all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire. Dorothy Provine is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable. You can't blame Lou Costello for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the green light. In my opinion Lou Costello was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the unwarranted attacks from the IRS. If you look at the last 3-4 Abbott & Costello movies you can notice the magic was gone. Check out Dance With Me Henry now that's a painful movie to watch.,negative
Lou Costello (sans Abbott) plays a small town self-employed rubbish collector (and the inventor of a time-controlling machine!) who is secretly courting the niece of the town big-shot. After a spat  Lou's girl (Dorothy Provine) runs into a misty cave--why it's misty we never learn--and emerges as a 30 foot giant. Provine is certainly a good sport  and she doesn't bother trying not to look ridiculous (it would've been impossible anyway)  yet the screenwriter is really cruel to this character  turning her not only into a giant but a nagging harpy as well. Provine bosses Costello around while creating havoc with the Army troops who get called in  but nothing funny is done with the transformation. Trumped by Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman the previous year  the film does feature Lou Costello in his final bow  but provides little else. The special effects are marginal  while the script needed funnier lines and the direction snappier pacing. *1/2 from ****,negative
OUR GANG got one chance at a feature film in its 22 year history  and this was the best that could be done? It's boring  forced and pointless  and I must respectfully disagree with the other poster on this film; the 1994 LITTLE RASCALS remake was better than this. Almost anything is. The kids are subordinate to the Civil War proceedings; it doesn't feel like an OUR GANG film at all  but like a humorless second-rate Shirley Temple clone.,negative
That snarl...<br /><br />That scowl...<br /><br />The acts of random violence...<br /><br />The gutteral voice...<br /><br />The fetish wear...<br /><br />That shaven head...<br /><br />It can mean only one thing...<br /><br />GRACE JONES IS BACK!<br /><br />Actually my sources tell me that the title role in Blade wasn't played by the 1980s diva  but by Wesley Snipes.<br /><br />All in all this is not an improvement.<br /><br />Blade is an adaptation of a comic character; somehow in the transfer from the simplistic  two-dimensional world of the printed page it has become even more simplistic and lost a couple of dimensions.<br /><br />The plot is hackneyed almost beyond belief and adds nothing to the vampire genre  in fact  much like Nosferatu  it seems to suck the life out of the audience. In brief  upwardly mobile vampire wants to become more powerful but is opposed by Blade  half-human  half-vampire  all annoying. It all climaxes with Blade being put in a vampire juice press  some bad martial arts and the most pitiful CGI since 1968.<br /><br />Blade has to be the least empathic character since Dolph Lundgren's Punisher (also a comic adaptation  perhaps there is a trend here?). Surely the audience is meant to be on the same side as the 'hero'? And whilst a vampire can be a tragic character  this is not true of Blade  he is relentlessly cruel  scornful and not a whole lot better than the bad guys.<br /><br />I assume that Wesley Snipes has an 'acting' career purely so that everyone else can be compared favourably. As he snarls his way through his movie you find yourself looking for a stake - even a ballpoint pen - anything to put Blade in the grave. <br /><br />As a piece of narcissism  Blade is pretty much unbeatable - we are treated to endless lingering shots of a gym-fresh Snipes for no reason whatsoever. Likewise no other actor is allowed any chance to give a reasonable performance; the likes of Steven Dorff *CAN* act  but they have to play second fiddle to Snipes' tedious performance.<br /><br />Kris Kristofferson used to appear in good movies  here he is reduced to a sidekick that you just know isn't going to make it through to the final reel. And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes  you guessed it  he rushes to the scene to wreak his revenge in the villain's giant underground lair.<br /><br />Why can't world-domination take place in a quiet country house? They always go ahead in underground cathedrals that would have had Albert Speer wondering if they were a little grandiose. A lot of these plans could be stopped right now if local councils paid more attention to plans for extending sub-basements. <br /><br />The rest of the movie is just as dull and unimaginative with nothing new to add to the genre. Vampires have been done to undeath and perhaps they should be laid to rest for a while - at least until someone can think of some way to make them interesting again.<br /><br />To finish  there *IS* a Grace Jones vampire movie  it's called Vamp and it's about ten times better than this.,negative
Though the Our Gang comedies still have their followers  I've got to say that their attempt to graduate to feature films  courtesy of Hal Roach came up way short. Why did Roach have to pick the Civil War as is subject with all the attendant racism that would follow.<br /><br />Dashing southern cavalier Phillips Holmes takes in young orphan Spanky McFarland and his young black friend Buckwheat Thomas after Spanky inadvertently exposes a card cheat on a riverboat. All is placid and serene in the Old South and then the Civil War comes to ruin it for everybody.<br /><br />But even children can charm the worst in the world and there's none worse than those damn Yankees. They just come south and ruin it for everybody.<br /><br />Criticized though it was for its southern viewpoint  Gone With The Wind did make a good case for the southern cause and the blacks portrayed even though servile which they would be out of necessity are still three dimensional characters. Hattie McDaniel would not have won her Oscar if it were not so. Butterfly McQueen's character of Prissy as silly and vacuous as she was has some dimension.<br /><br />Here though is maybe some of the worst racial stereotyping ever brought forth in Hollywood. The companionship of Spanky and Buckwheat does show that kids get along  racial feelings are acquired not inbred. It's not the servility of the blacks that's objectionable  but there total acceptance of it. Right from that horrible watermelon song  sung over the title credits  the message of General Spanky is a bad one.<br /><br />Yet it did get an Oscar nomination for Sound recording  probably one of the very few Hal Roach ever got out of the short subject field.<br /><br />General Spanky is far from Gone With The Wind though.,negative
"Terrible. The only way I could even begin to consider it funny is if it made fun of itself. Amazing. It's about an ass that fights crime. And he drinks/smokes! How very funny! It's funny because where most people put things in their mouth, he puts them in himself! And now he's getting sexual service from some lady! This show is so great! That is what I would have to say if I liked the show  though I'm sure you can see the obvious sarcasm. I've noticed some people have been comparing this show to 12 oz. Mouse and Squid Billies. Why would you even try? There's nothing to compare. The other two shows actually have some decent character development. In conclusion  I hate Assy Mcgee. I twinge at the name of it.",negative
Very strange screenplay by Cameron Crowe (following on the heels of his Fast Times at Ridgemont High) has little inspiration and flails away at dumb gags. At least Fast Times had a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick (courtesy of a good director  Amy Heckerling  and Crowe's undeniable penchant for capturing letter-perfect teen-speak); here  Chris Penn (Sean's brother  natch) is the goof-off who makes life hell for straight arrow Eric Stoltz  and the filmmakers seem to think he's hilarious. Jenny Wright has some good moments as a mall-worker  but Illan Mitchell-Smith is lost in a head-scratching subplot about a teen who seems to be infatuated with a shell-shocked ex-soldier. Queasy  confused nonsense given a shiny sheen and a soundtrack full of pop-rock tunes  but characters one would hope to avoid. Supporting players Lea Thompson  Rick Moranis  Lee Ving  and Sherilyn Fenn are wasted in stupid roles. * from ****,negative
Wow  well  you know those shock things they use in hospitals to get your heart pumping again? I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because I had to take a break and restart my brain to semi-normal functionality every so often. I mean this movie goes soooooo slooooow its ridiculous  to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous. They just don't talk!! And while talking isnt everything  and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary  and the music is great  that was probably the best part  but then go listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie. So many people give this awesome reviews  and for its time  i'd say the special effects and filmography is quite good  but as for the acting  or lack thereof  it just needed a little something more  no shootem ups or sex etc.  profanity isnt even required  but a little more emotion  these guys were like stones  just sitting there with long faces. All in all  if you need something to calm yourself down  just play the movie  dont even start at the beginning if you've seen it before  just start anywhere  lay down  and relax  it'll put you right to sleep.,negative
I didn't like this movie for many reasons - VERY BORING! It was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this  but seriously I was very bored watching this. There was hardly any action. Although the Classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice. The visuals were very creative. Whenever this movie pops on TV  I feel like changing the station instantly. Not because it is a bad movie  just because I know what I am in for when watching this - complete and total boredom. It is a movie I saw when I was young  but I never got into the science fiction thing... because it simply wasn't real. Just like this movie - very unrealistic. I never understood half the movie anyway.,negative
I will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from me.<br /><br />The film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process. I'd love to know what they were on when this film was being made.<br /><br />Its also the most historically-inaccurate film in existence; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place.<br /><br />Characters are unlikeable  design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to it.<br /><br />And the ending is probably the worst of it: its supposed to be thought-provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is What the F$*K is going on?! <br /><br />I'd say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes  AVOID this film at all cost and choose a sci-fi movie that ISN'T stuck up its own @$$.,negative
2001 is one of those movies where  if you don't like it  you are told that you don't 'get it' and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You're told that you clearly have a slow attention span  and just want to see sex  explosions  and have the plot handed to you on a platter.<br /><br />Let's break down the movie shall we? Three minutes of blackness  with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the Savannah. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the background. A bunch of pointless dialogue  and a group of moon scientists find another monolith.<br /><br />Cut to a spaceship that's too long for the crew complement--three sleeping people  two people named Dave and Frank  who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation. And then there's HAL  the 'perfect' supercomputer who runs the ship. Predictably  he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. An evil  coldly ruthless super-mind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die  leaving Dave floating in a pod. He simply uses the airlock  puts on a spacesuit  and turns HAL off--agonizingly slowly. Then  apparently  there's some psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter.<br /><br />Here's the movie with the pauses taken out: Apes see monolith  kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave gets a prerecorded message  and evolves at Jupiter.<br /><br />This is not me 'not getting it.' This is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing. Sure  it's realistic  but I find I have no reason to care. No matter the message  no movie can be good without being entertaining. Frankly  every character could be replaced with Keanu Reeves  and nothing would change.,negative
"I did and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I can never regain again.<br /><br />I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can't appreciate art. I love a good film with profound messages  brilliant cinematography  and great directing.<br /><br />This film just isn't one of them.<br /><br />My main complaint about this film is that it's so horribly slow-paced  to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand  sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there's not enough exposition to let people who haven't read the book know what's going on (My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I watched it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /><br />Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout) <br /><br />For the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music  waiting for the actual movie to begin.<br /><br />For the following minute and a half  you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.<br /><br />The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight  see the monolith  fight some more  pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book.<br /><br />*Finally* we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand  yet here it feels absolutely agonizing). At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity.<br /><br />Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed  again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!). The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.<br /><br />*Seven* minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it's realistic to portray it as such  but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its realism. Let me tell you about this realism thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like watching people die  but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I'm supposed to care about this character  feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.<br /><br />Anyway  now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal  chillingly villainous  ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He's great. And the Open the pod bay doors sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings on.<br /><br />Four minutes for HAL to die. And die he does. Slowly  painfully  losing intelligence with every minute  voice getting lower and slower  singing Daisy, Daisy  all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing.<br /><br />Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could FEEL my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy's whacked out psychedelic version of space travel  again with that thrice-cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it out so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacks.<br /><br />I'm not even going to try to explain the ending  mostly because I don't quite get it myself. Supposedly he's in an alien research laboratory and they're teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby. None of this comes across in the film. For all you know  it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. A lot of the movie felt that way.<br /><br />The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway through. The second time I suffered through this sore excuse for a film  it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted. It's that boring.<br /><br />Call this crummy film art if you wish. I wouldn't. I've seen more interesting art in the local museum. And I am never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering ever again.",negative
All those who are into the PC culture are aghast at the dogmatic Christian view of this film  claiming it contains racist ideation and/or religious intolerance.<br /><br />Those who don't care about this  but are oriented towards slick production values and competent acting are dismayed at the lack of such here.<br /><br />Those who decry both of these are apoplectic that this production was let loose on the general public  as evidenced in comments here.<br /><br />What is an interesting premise  which isn't original  but is a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND  is dealt with in a rather immature manner in this film  yet done with gusto. What the crew and actors lacked in sensibility  professional abilities and technical expertise is somewhat offset by the intensity they display.<br /><br />It isn't nearly as bad as many here think  and would have been fine in the hands of someone with maturity and common sense  and it is enough below mediocrity to elicit laughs and groans. However  it unfolds with enough intensity to keep interest throughout  and is close to on par with a Corman-produced entry of his earliest period of work  or the material of Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you get it for $2 (or less) as did I  you won't feel disappointed  but will wish you could have had a say in how it was made.,negative
I am completely into this type of story line but once the movie fired up  I honestly said out loud   I just rented a two dollar budget Christian POS. The only thing I could find to like about this film was it has a descent story but it was awfully executed. Horrible actors  horrible direction and producing.<br /><br />The director and producer need to go watch the cube before trying to pull off a movie in a single room. There was absolutely nothing that kept you intrigued to the point that you didn't notice you were in the same room the entire movie. Horrible! The two main actresses were very easy on the eyes and you could tell that was the director counting on to hold your attention. But these two and their bios can speak to this  are horrible in front of the camera.<br /><br />Don't rent this. Unless you are blind  because it might go up a few stars if you only listen to it.,negative
Not like I went in expecting a lot out of it  but I was at least hoping for a fun dumb big budget movie. This isn't even that. This item ranks in the bottom half of all the vampire movies I've ever seen (and believe me  I've seen a lot of them). Bad acting  zero characterization  little to no thought  almost non-existent plot (and that that's there you can drive semi-trucks through the holes in). Sure  it has action and is loud  and has more action  and more noise  and blood  and action... These things alone do not make a good (or even halfway decent) movie. Beats me how some people can say this is the best vampire movie ever made--all I can assume is they haven't seen many. I suggest seeing Near Dark instead.,negative
Do not waste your money or time. Terrible movie. Bad acting  plot all over the place. Really  really bad acting. Man  this movie is just plain bad. I shut it off at 7 minutes. The script is bad  the directing is bad  it seems to me that a high school group got together to do a project for their drama class. Yes  it's that bad. The acting is not convincing at all  mind you I saw only 7 minutes of it. How this movie made it to DVD  is beyond me. <br /><br />It should have been left in the editing storage room. I saw the cover and thought it was pretty cool  I sure's heck won't do that next time :_),negative
Let's see  cardboard characters like Muslim terrorists have forced a cardboard scientist to perform some exotic drug tests on some cardboard people who have been drugged and kidnapped. You'll be sure to laugh when these pathetic excuses for humanoids get their just deserts! Turns out the drug experiments have given them the ability to sense another world....the world of religious fantasy!--complete with cardboard demons who look like they are made of Papier Mache. Everybody gets dragged off to Hell except for one poor chap who goes to Heaven where he can presumably spend Eternity with the blockheads that created this Masterpiece of the Absurd. I think I'd opt for Hellfire myself. Go see something else  unless you are stoned  in which case  you might actually like it! Couldn't hurt!,negative
Evil Behind You  was created for a specific purpose in mind  to shove the writer/directors personal views on who either gets to walk on water or who gets to dance with the devil. Sadly it would seem that the creators were so focused on making their point that they took it's power away completely by force feeding their point to the viewer.The way its message is presented Almost reminds me of the stories I've heard of the Spanish inquisition! From one real Christian to another  Avoid this like the plague  fear tactics never work when trying to send this kind of message!!<br /><br />The acting was horrible the selection of Muslim terrorists was racist and unfair(they're terrorists so they must be Muslims). The premise of this was good  the story provided a great conduit for its message  however it was the execution of these ideas that fell short making it very difficult to even separate the message from the messenger so to speak.<br /><br />You'd be better off dusting off your old Ghost DVD with Mr Swayze to better receive this message. at least that movie didn't try to shove itself down your throat. Or if you like Good Christian movies with a powerful message  try End of the Spear,negative
I gave this movie a four-star rating for a few reasons. First  I felt that this movie was definitely preaching and I hate that. Still  it's my own fault for watching a Christian movie in the first place.<br /><br />My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting. The back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle  someone opening some sort of boundary that let demons into our world and the like. Something I am very interested in  indeed. This movie almost hit the target. It was more like on the edge of the target  more on the tree than the target itself...<br /><br />The basic plot of this movie is two couples are abducted by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments. However  because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms  the men of the couples are now able to feel  smell  hear  and see the demons of the spiritual world. In that order. Apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm.<br /><br />This movie is very clichéd. They took the title seriously as the men  while chained to the beds  demand their women look behind them because there is something there.<br /><br />Although a good effort for what it was  I think the special effects could have been done so much better. The demon scratching at the woman was  in a word  hilarious. The wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically cheered when she died. We were all hoping she'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair  though.<br /><br />The message is one that I don't care to comment on  other than I think the Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it.<br /><br />And so I give it four stars because it is not the movie's fault I am not a Christian and don't like this type of message  and I got a kick out of making comments throughout. My friend and I watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of MST3K.,negative
This movie probably began with a good idea but that's as far as it went. When I read the cover at Blockbuster I thought it had promise but that was based on the overall idea for the movie. The movie began with a professor talking about how in the future we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions. There was no explanation of how that would happen but that's okay I thought it would be developed that in the movie. It wasn't. In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes taped to their heads. Beside each one are two attractive women. The men begin asking Do you hear that or Do you see them. We conclude they think they are seeing ghosts or some other creature that seem invisible or they are hallucinating. The women do not see these creatures. This was fine for the first five minutes BUT THIS SCENE GOES ON FOR A FULL HOUR. It is briefly punctuated by flashbacks that have no correlation to the so called plot of the film. We are also introduced to a man in a lab coat and what appear to be Middle Eastern terrorists. What is this about? We never find out. The flash backs lead us to believe that the terrorists are forcing the man in the lab coat to perform diabolical experiments on these young people but we never understand why. At the end of the movie the terrorists finally do what terrorists do  they blow up the lab  but why? What is the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many disconnected thoughts and ideas that there are too many to enumerate but one more notable one is that fact that the man in the lab coats and the terrorist pop in and out of the room throughout the movie and not once do the young men attempt to escape or even leave the tables on which they are laying even though they are not strapped down! The makers of the movie also bring in cameo appearances by cockroaches on several occasions but again we never learn what that has to do with the storyline. Sorry but this movie was a waste of $4 and the time I spent driving to the rental store and then watching it. Take my advice. Don't rent it.,negative
I would have given this LESS than a 1 rating if it were possible. The entire film should have been left on the cutting-room floor. What a pathetic waste of time  money and effort! Let's see...assemble the prettiest cast you can find (which of course is in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lack)...throw together the thinnest plot you can dig up...and viola! An abominable piece of trash that the director and/or producer should be ashamed to put their name on. How much WORSE can the horror genre get? And don't use low budget as an excuse...I have seen many GREAT low-budget films....in fact some of the best horror classics of all time were low-budget. If you don't have the talent and ingenuity to make a GOOD horror film  then for God's sake don't make one at all!!!,negative
this film is basically a poor take on the old urban legend of the babysitter who gets crank calls telling her to check the children  she calls the police who trace the calls and find there coming from inside the house. when a killer calls has a story so simplistic a little kid could have written it. not much suspense  it becomes clear who the killer is halfway through the film. at the beginning  when the first victim is killed it looks like a bondage fetish scene from a porn site or something. whats up with that? the film is oh so typical slasher fare with a plot about as original as a Beatles concert. even by low budget slasher standards its cheesy. don't waste your time with this. nuff said,negative
"When A Killer Calls has got to be the biggest ripoff released by Asylum so far. It's about a sexy babysitter on duty who receives spooky calls from a creepy voice who asks her repeatedly  Have you checked the girl? Naturally she has the calls traced by the cops (after having to perform some realistically unnecessary tasks -- hanging up when he calls  waiting ten seconds  and dialing *57). Sound familiar? Yeah  that's why I rented it  too.<br /><br />Well  it should. And I hate to say it  but this could've been more entertaining than the big-screen crapfest that was released around the same time if not for one fatal mistake -- Rather than revelling in B-movie ripoff glory  it tried to do something original. It tried to make the lead character sympathetic  rather than having clichéd  campy fun with her. Mind you  this could've worked with a talented actress. But she wasn't. Sure  she looked good  and she screamed  and cried  but . . . oh well  whatever.<br /><br />Then came the horrific ending. Not horrific in that it was horrifying  horrific in that it was BORING. The pacing up until that point (about an hour in) was campy  clichéd  and fun. Then it heads in another direction  and it veers away from just another dumb  fun slasher movie with a sexy teenage cast to a Hostel-esquire gore/borefest.<br /><br />I guess this falls into the Oh well, whatever category. The lead actress flubbed a line? Oh well  whatever  I don't feel like reshooting it. We forgot to give the killer motivation? Oh well  whatever  I don't feel like rewriting it. The pacing completely changes halfway through? Oh well  whatever  I don't feel like shaving fifteen minutes off. Continuity errors? Oh well  whatever.<br /><br />If you like this kind of movie (dumb  cheesy  predictable  campy splatter movie with sexy cast)  then you'll be fine up until the ending. The ending is stupid  it's not fun  it's not scary  it's not campy or cheesy or quickly-paced. In fact  there was almost exactly five minutes of the character doing nothing but being tied up (and that's not a spoiler because it's on the back of the DVD) and looking around at the stuff in the room  then screaming  and . . . whatever.",negative
I'm gettin' sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one-line synopsis then end up being equal to what you'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap.<br /><br />Who knows: Witchery may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios  even with a big name cast (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink  nudge-nudge) and the effervescent likes of Hildegard Knef (I dunno  some woman...).<br /><br />But on film  it just falls apart faster than a papier-mache sculpture in a rainstorm. Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Eastern seaboard  and one of them (a woman  I'd guess) is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque  tortuous ways. <br /><br />Okay  right there you have a cross-section of plots from The Exorcist  The Omen  Ten Little Indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanic-worshippers-run-amok line. None of it is very entertaining and for the most part  you'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it's over.<br /><br />No  not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help matters much. They're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their all. <br /><br />From the looks of it  Hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda... well  who knows; a celebrity PETA benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is she's in to nowadays.<br /><br />And the torture scenes! Ecchhhh. You'll see people get their mouths sewn shut  dangled up inside roaring fireplaces  strung up in trees during a violent storm  vessels bursting out of their necks  etc  etc. Sheesh  and I thought Mark of the Devil was the most sadistic movie I'd seen....<br /><br />Don't bother. It's not worth your time. I can't believe I told you as much as I did. If you do watch it  just see if you can count the cliches. And yes  Blair gets possessed  as if you didn't see THAT coming down Main Street followed by a marching band.<br /><br />No stars. Witchery - these witches will give you itches.,negative
This movie had horrible lighting and terrible camera movements. This movie is a jumpy horror flick with no meaning at all. The slashes are totally fake looking. It looks like some 17 year-old idiot wrote this movie and a 10 year old kid shot it. With the worst acting you can ever find. People are tired of knives. At least move on to guns or fire. It has almost exact lines from When A Stranger Calls. With gruesome killings  only crazy people would enjoy this movie. It is obvious the writer doesn't have kids or even care for them. I mean at show some mercy. Just to sum it up  this movie is a B movie and it sucked. Just for your own sake  don't even think about wasting your time watching this crappy movie.,negative
i found this movie to be mostly a P.O.S.it was low budget but that isn't the problem.the problem is the movie is just lame.it doesn't really make a lot of sense.yes it does explain why things happened but that's not what i mean.there was just no reason for it all.the movie also moved very slow.the last ice age was quicker than this.also  i think they went overboard a bit in the kills.i don't mean they were too gross but the killer just seemed to spend too much time smashing his victim over the head or stabbing his victim. maybe i'm being petty but i just didn't like the movie.the whole thing seemed like a lower rate version of When a Stranger Calls and maybe that was the whole point.but so what.for me When A Stranger Kills is a 4/10*,negative
To sum it up in a nutshell  this film was disappointing and could have been shortened by twenty minutes.<br /><br />The acting was sub-par  the only decent actors of the bunch being Trisha  the killer and Molly. The music was slightly lame but fitting and the special effects were much too overused. The story/scriptwriting was poor  the unnecessary torture/romantic scenes being dragged on for way too long and a disappointing ending.<br /><br />The start of the film was rather slow  the fake-looking gore not much of interest. Trisha arrived at the house  and there was some premise for a good storyline.<br /><br />Trisha started to receive the threatening phone calls  which heightened the suspense. This momentary suspense  the best feature of the movie began to build  but then the friends crashed the place  wrecking all potential suspense/horror in the film.<br /><br />The plot then becomes obtuse from here on. Chemistry sparks between the two couples  and then the killer picks off Frank and the other girl. This scene was dragged on and unnecessary.<br /><br />The killer then makes her way for Trisha and ties her up. There is an overdone torture scene which goes on for at least ten minutes too long. As the gore is done badly this is not entertaining at all  and it bores more than shocks.<br /><br />In summary  the first thirty minutes of this film sound promising but then poorly written dialogue and general lack of plot ruins this film.<br /><br />3/10.,negative
When a Killer Calls is an unusually nasty slasher flick  with some very unpleasant and unsettling sequences. The decision was clearly made to try and cash in on the remake of When a Stranger Calls by pretty much putting in -- almost word for word -- the phone call sequences from that movie. They seem very forced.<br /><br />Additionally  the filmmaker commits the cardinal (but all too common) sin of having the heroine's friends being repulsive jerks. So for the beginning of the film  we really like and are rooting for the babysitter (a nice believable job by Rebekah Kochan)  but then she's joined by standard slasher-flick teenage friends and the mood is ruined.<br /><br />The flick sort of works  but it probably a lot more unpleasant than you'll be expected  so be fore-warned.,negative
There is not one character on this sitcom with any redeeming qualities. They are all self-centered  obnoxious or two dimensional. My husband watches it  claiming that there is nothing else on  but I would rather watch nothing.<br /><br />The only sitcom that I can think of that was worse was Yes  Dear. At least that one didn't get 9 seasons.<br /><br />Being overweight does not make a comic genius  and Kevin James does not have the talent of John Goodman  Jackie Gleason or John Belushi. Leah Remini may have talent  but if so  she is wasted on the shrewish wife. Jerry Stiller is convincing as an annoying old man. Maybe there is a reason for that.<br /><br />This is a perfect example of why sitcoms are derided.,negative
I can't help but be completely annoyed by this sitcom. It's like they didn't even bothered trying ro write good comedy  just rehash third rate jokes and hope it sticks. The worst of all this is that it's all so damm uninteresting and lacking in every way.<br /><br />To make things worse leading man Kevin James has a permanent I'm so funny smug grin on his face that would be tolerable if only he once delivered in the comedy department  which he doesn't  he just lies there doing nothing like a big unfunny baby. Which takes me to the relationship between the Heffernan's- easily the most insincere and poor representation of a married couple on any TV show  really headache inducingly obnoxious Remini spends the whole show as if it where a violent chore to even be around her own husband. Jerry Stiller yanking the few laughs on the show is doing a 100% repetition of his role as Frank Costanza in Seinfeld only this time his hints mostly tread on water due to the inability of the central duo in recognizing a joke even if it flew by them. The episodes just drift along in a stream of nothingness  their jobs add nothing and their interaction is even worse.<br /><br />This is not even a waste of talent  there is no talent here  this is a laughless creative desert.,negative
This is a lame comedy.<br /><br />Here's why: A man and wife sitcom. Okay.<br /><br />The Husband is a douche bag. The Wife is the Einstein.<br /><br />How original is that? <br /><br />Jerry Stiller is just the same guy on Seinfeld.<br /><br />The gags are lame. No witty one-liners.<br /><br />I have had enough. Stop this now.<br /><br />The Last Word: Stupid. The destruction of the average white guy continues on ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a funny comedian. He just isn't here. Leah Remini is great eye candy  but is unlikeable. Wasted talent is the word. Bad sitcom.,negative
A show about an incredibly dumb  man-child and his shrewish hot wife. 99% of the plots revolves around Doug doing something unbelievably stupid and then comes a variable: a) either he hides it from his wife or b) tell his wife  she emasculates him and then it's up to the father-in-law (Arthur: the typecast character from Seinfeld) to aggravate the situation.<br /><br />And the writers dare to say it was influenced by the Honeymooners (an absolute classic) and that the plots are drawn from real-life situations  unless you live in a cave  you know that's not true.<br /><br />Anyway  let's just put it this way. If Kevin James had been thin  the show would have got canceled fromm the pilot. If you're 12  or you're fond of fat jokes.. be my guest  watch this show (or any of Kevin James movies for that matter).<br /><br />I've noticed some posters compare this travesty to much superior shows like Friends  Seinfeld and Everybody Loves Raymond -- I'm still wondering how could anyone do that,negative
This show uses a rather tired sitcom formula of the fat idiot blue collar slob with the pretty (and sometimes shrewish-seeming) wife and crazy in-law(s). With this show  it's fat unfunny comedian Kevin James as Doug Hefferman who works as a delivery driver for a parcel service. He has a pretty wife  Carrie (Leah Remini)  who works as legal assistant  and senile father-in-law  Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller)  who lives in his daughter and son-in-law's basement. Kevin James' Doug is your typical beer drinking  sports loving  TV watching slob of a sitcom husband who would rather watch the tube than deal with his marital issues. He also has a couple of idiot friends who lend extra stupidity to the problems encountered by this show's couple. Beyond the few laughs supplied by Jerry Stiller's crazy old man character this show was generally unfunny. Kevin James' imbecilic behavior usually caused the show's problems that usually resolved by his wife. This show continued a run of sitcoms with the fat stupid father/husband and their pretty wives that all seemed to run on ABC for some reason.,negative
I am very diplomatic in my reviews  and as an academic writer  try to give creative license to TV writers trying to explicate a true story. This story  about Karen Carpenter  could have helped so many  yet due to the directing and editing  does not.<br /><br />The story  in this case  is not fully addressed  unless one reads psychological journals. While Cynthia Gibb portrays a realistic Karen  it is sad that so much has been edited...Louise Fletcher portrays her mother  and does an excellent job  with limited material and dialogue. In this case  I give the actors credit for surviving this project.<br /><br />Why is the audience not permitted to see causation factors?....American audiences are quite savvy  and if they have cable  usually educated.<br /><br />I sincerely feel that I could have written a better story  would not have edited out the truth  and allowed the actors to project the reality.<br /><br />Richard Carpenter  as director  has seriously underestimated and insulted American audiences. Karen's story is important  and it is sad we will never hear it.,negative
I and a friend rented this movie. We both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging. The movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending. We both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot.,negative
I have been a fan of the Carpenters for a long time  read the biography  watched the specials  and saw the Karen Carpenter Story. This movie really didn't show the real Karen Carpenter. In the movie she seems to be a shy and a pretty much of loner (except for one girl friend). The real Karen Carpenter was much different. She was outgoing and friendly. She had lots of friends  especially Olive Newton-John. The movie doesn't even show Karen's attempts for a solo album and her meeting Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy Karen. Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York  she did see a psychologist  but it was voluntary and once a day and then she would leave to go to her hotel room. Also  Karen was taking pills to increase her thyroid  so she could loss weight  but stop taking them because the psychologist recommended her not too. Also  the Karen's husband in the movie is named Bob Knight  but in real life was named Tom Burris. Also  Karen wasn't divorced from Tom  but only separated. Karen was to sign the divorce papers on the day she died. Also  Agnes found Karen naked in the closet unciousness  unlike in the movie where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommend on seeing it.,negative
I've become a big fan of the Carpenters  and I didn't really enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I feel it focused far too much on her anorexia and didn't let her true personality shine through. I wasn't overly fond of Cynthia Gibb's portrayal; especially knowing she decided Karen's anorexia was suicide  which it clearly wasn't. Although her family was not big on hugs and kisses  I thought the movie portrayed Agnes (their mother) as being terrible.<br /><br />I did find a few scenes to be harrowing in a way  such as where she sees herself in a mirror that seems to distort her and make her look heavier; I thought the metaphor (so-to-speak) there was rather effective. When the family is playing pool and discussing her divorce and she breaks down and Richard is shocked when he comforts her and feels her frail body was pretty moving (which is probably the wrong word) as well.<br /><br />Overall  I feel they needed to bring out her more bubbly  quirky side--her genuine personality. Even as the focus of the film  there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia (though of course no one can really know)  and almost made it seem baseless. The film was more poor-singer-with-anorexia than Karen Carpenter's story  in my opinion.<br /><br />I would assume that they changed her husband's name/profession and all because they couldn't get his permission to actually include him (there were some bad terms there)  but that whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. On this note  I can't recall the movie bringing out her longing for a family and kids  which greatly prevailed in her life and explains her whirlwind romance and quick marriage to her husband.<br /><br />On the whole  it ends up as a low-budget made-for-TV movie that just isn't very high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who is hoping to see beyond Karen's disease. I feel that such a legend deserves/deserved a better film as a tribute to an amazing person and an awesome voice.,negative
hey ....i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so much perhaps i missed the point.The way i see it   a lot of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with 'schizophrenia' and have informed  excited  shocked evoked emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and think.........while it is true that aparna sen's endeavor was an ambitious one  in light of all the other movies   this one falls short..... miserably......it was too slow  there were no details about anything and the ending .... was completely ...pointless......it was not open ended or anything ....just pointless.....so watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted.......,negative
This is a film that really makes me cringe. In 1951  MGM and Looney Toons were making some of their very best cartoons--with amazing animation  exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then  in the late 40s  a new style of animation began to appear (such as the Crusader Rabbit series on TV)--animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money. Unfortunately  Columbia Picture's cynical ploy worked!! Instead of the public hating the toons (as they should have)  many accepted them and the Oscar people (AMPAS) actually gave this film the award for Best Animated Short--giving legitimacy for an inferior product. Unfortunately  in the dollars and sense world of Hollywood  this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios--resulting in rather crappy cartoons. Later  it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds  the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch. The cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone. And for this tragedy  I blame  in part  GERALD MCBOING-BOING--one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons. The story isn't that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying boing-boing incessantly is a pain.,negative
With several name actors (Lance Henrikson  David Warner  Joe Don Baker)  why was Jeffery Combs given the lead? Henrikson would have been a perfect fit for the lead  as would Warner  Baker or even others in the movie such as Charles Napier. Combs was miscast in this  and did a poor job of it. Everything he did seemed fake or contrived.<br /><br />The script is poor. Meaning that if Lance Henrikson (or another) had the lead role  he might have saved the film (removed it from my waste of time category)  but it still would have been a bad movie. The screen play was completely lacking. The director should have recognized this and helped the movie along.,negative
'Felony' is a B-movie. No doubt about it.<br /><br />Of course  if you take a look at the cast lineup you might have some high hopes for its entertainment potential. This film is stuffed with all of those wonderful character actors that you grew up with  the ones with the faces you immediately recognize even though you probably don't know their names. It's amazing that the filmmakers were able to get all of these people together on one project  almost like they decided to do a B-movie actor reunion. The cast even includes a couple of really first-rate actors: David Warner  who most people will recognize from 'Titanic' (although my favorite of his roles is Jack the Ripper in 'Time After Time') and Lance Henriksen  who many will remember as Bishop in 'Aliens'. These two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine films.<br /><br />However  as impressive as this collection of actors is  their talent is never fully manifested on the screen. The writers of 'Felony' spent a lot of money to assemble a dream-team cast and then missed their golden opportunity because of one important factor  the common denominator of all B-movies: a silly script.<br /><br />We start with a silly premise. The bad guys are caught on tape committing a gruesome murder and they relentlessly pursue the film crew in order to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence. But honestly  why bother? In the time it takes them to track down the film crew  a thousand copies of that tape could be made and circulated to every law enforcement agency and media outlet. The criminals don't seem to realize how futile their effort is  and they talk as if stealing and destroying the one original videotape is going to solve the whole problem. Silly...but I suppose if the bad guys were so logical there would be no movie.<br /><br />Then there is the dialogue. It is at times silly  at times cliché  and at times unbelievable...everything you have come to expect from a B-movie. Of course  I have always believed that strong performances can overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material. This cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances  and although a number of the cast members are not good actors at all and have achieved B-movie status quite deservedly  one still might be hopeful that the stronger part of the cast would be able to infuse some life into their parts. However  it's disappointing to see that few of the actors in this film really seem to take the movie seriously enough to give it their best shot. There's not much inspiration evident in these performances  but then again it's an uninspiring script. Now  I'll admit that some of the more colorful actors in the cast do manage to add a certain amount of pizazz into the delivery of their lines  but honestly  even the very fine actors I mentioned earlier seem mostly disinterested and uninvolved with the story.<br /><br />Speaking of the story...even if the acting had been of a high enough caliber that it made the dialogue seem a little less cheesy  it still would not redeem 'Felony' from the fact that its writer commits the ultimate faux pas of low budget action movie scripts: a plot with as many holes as a block of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie a hundred times and you still won't figure out how everything adds up. In an effort to create suspense and always keep the viewer guessing  the writer throws in all kinds of surprises and unexpected twists into his script and ends up with a jigsaw puzzle  but when you get to the end you find there are a bunch of pieces that just don't fit anywhere and others that are missing. I admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing  but creating plot twists that exist just to confuse you and which are not consistent with the rest of the story is amateurish. There was so much that was never explained that I felt extremely frustrated at the end. If you decide to watch it  be prepared to be confused.<br /><br />I haven't even mentioned all kinds of other silly things about this movie  but I won't bother. The funny thing is that despite everything I've said  I have to admit that I can't give 'Felony' 1/10 stars. Although I can't exactly put my finger on why  I actually found this film to be somewhat likable. The silliness can actually be fun at times if you are in the mood for it. Plus  I really like some of these character actors  and even though their performances are somewhat lackluster considering their talents  I still got a kick out of seeing them.<br /><br />Now  I realize I have been rating this film from the standpoint of a serious moviegoer. It's entirely possible I have completely missed the point. It could be that the filmmakers' intention all along was to make a B-movie. Maybe the silliness is all completely intentional. If that's the case  and if I were to rate it on those terms  I would have to say that 'Felony' is a classic in the genre of tongue-in-cheek action flicks. B-movie fans will love seeing all of their favorite actors together in one film  will get some chuckles from the script  and will be entertained by the healthy dose of guns  explosions  and chases.,negative
Lance Henriksen has a knack for being the top name in a B-movie  even in this case starring along side Charles Napier  Master Control Program  and Joe Don Baker. As always he does a great job of being the bad guy  but the plot is just bad (don't even get me started about the ending). And the editing is so horrible it might actually be a thing of beauty. Is it just me  or does it seem that Joe Don Baker was spliced into the movie at the last minute? Also  anytime glass is broken in this movie  the editing is so anti-phenomenal. Lastly  after watching this  I figure David Warner is dying for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Felony  this will be the third movie I give the rating of 1/10  joining Iron Eagle IV and No Mercy.,negative
One of the worst things a film studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others  commercializing a 'shock' or 'gore' factor in order to sell tickets to be able to buy their Birch a new diamond necklace. Another worst thing is to totally misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by fabricating events  dialog and images to the director's own liking. Lastly  one of the worst things a film studio can do is to use bottom-of-the-barrel actors and shoot it all on a sound stage that was rented for fifty cents a day. All three of these travesties the makers of this film are guilty of. This is  hands-down  the worst movie I have ever seen  and I've seen thousands. A score of '1' is too good for this waste of celluloid. Not only should the filmmakers be ashamed for making it  they should be ashamed for negatively exploiting the heroes of this story  which are the people who experienced this tragedy firsthand  both the living and the dead.,negative
I couldn't. I was bored  not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b-movie whose plot was all about the cannibalism  but the fact I was watching a subtitle foreign film  which doesn't bother me at all  but was STILL dubbed.<br /><br />The special effects were awful. As the back of the plane splits off  you can see the model is hollow as it breaks away in the phony snow. Most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play  as the sounds of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scene.<br /><br />But how what will they eat? They have no food one military person (It's never clear what this guy does or why he's in charge) says  which I'm sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food  since they were concerned if the people were alive  not how they'd eat. It was simply a stupid line written to point out that  yes  they will have to eat the dead bodies to survive.<br /><br />When they finally decide to eat the bodies  one man finds one shirtless body  who despite being in the snow for however long  is not remotely frozen  in fact  his flesh is very flexible and fresh. He cuts the fresh meat off his back  that again  is not frozen or even cold it appears  and this scene goes on for five minutes. That's where I had to stop. The remake Alive was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that I'm sure the real survivors praised whereas I can't imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version. It was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary. Avoid.,negative
Making a film based on a true story  particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 Andean plane crash  is hard for even the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans behind this forgettable and cheap exploitation flick don't even try! The actual names of both the survivors and the casualties of the Uruguayan air force plane crash have ALL been altered  the crash itself is obviously staged in a very slip-shod manner  and the cannibalism aspect has been unnecessarily and gorily played up. Shockingly  it made a ton of money on both sides of the border. Thankfully  thought  it has mercifully been forgotten. But the same people behind this would later give us the equally revolting GUYANA: CULT OF THE DAMNED!<br /><br />This cheap horror exploitation flick necessitated the making of ALIVE some fifteen years later. That film was a masterpiece. SURVIVE!  to put it mildly  is not.,negative
"Leave Ed Wood alone. To call Plan 9 from Outer Space the worst film ever made would be to deny this abysmally vulgar heap of Hollywood guano its rightful title. This pretentious fusion of witless whimsy and bathetic sociopolitical commentary actually does seem to be formed along the lines of Plan 9, with badly-staged scenes of down-on-their-luck actors on cheap sets interspersed with what appears to be footage of battle and crowd scenes cribbed from higher-budget epics. But whereas Plan 9 occasionally manages to be funny when it means to be and reasonably entertaining overall  this tacky pageant is appallingly lacking in basic showmanship  with scenes ranging from offensively unfunny (the disgusting burlesque of Groucho Marx stealing Manhattan from the Indians) to low camp (Hedy Lamarr attempting to impersonate Joan of Arc hearing her voices) to tedious (Dennis Hopper doing absolutely nothing with the role of Napoleon) to the unexpectedly poignant performance of Peter Lorre as the psychotic Nero. Give the worst director trophy to Irwin Allen  for turning so much into so little.",negative
Humm  an Italian movie starred by David hasselhoff and Linda Blair  I wasn´t expecting very much  to be honest and in fact  I took even less than I was expecting. It doesn´t mean this movie is the worst I have seen because I have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this. Apart from that you are going to love some special effects  they are really cheesy and bad. Now I only want to watch Troll 3 by this same director  sure it is not going to be worse than that.,negative
"I'm an atheist. To me history and truth mean a lot.<br /><br />This film is made after a novel published in 1921  which is still being updated up to this day as if it was a history book. Well it's not. The movie is about the novels 1950s version. Some actors were GREAT but that doesn't cover the plot.<br /><br />In short man invents a super-bomb so God and his friends hold a tribunal to see if they must intervene. The devil analogy persecutes man  and for defense we have the spirit of man. What is the spirit of man anyway? And why was the first defendant Adam? Eventually you just get US Christian propaganda in a 5th grade history book of the time. Though other religions are mentioned  only European Christianity is explored.<br /><br />First we get the caveman story. The women are scrawny stereotypes of damsels in distress. Real cave women were as strong as men and just as resistant. Hard times  hard life  adapt and survive. All this is watered down by mid-century stereotypes.<br /><br />Next we get Egypt's first pyramid construction. Today we see a different story and know that there were a lot less deaths and regular citizens at work as well. Loosing mentioned amount of many lives in the process would have been a national disaster and nobody after would try to beat it. As if there was only ONE pyramid build.<br /><br />The part about Moses and one true god was as if the Spanish inquisition was asking nicely. Inquisition itself was never even mentioned in the movie.<br /><br />Helen of Troy's evil grim was so vile that I didn't see why so many were even interested in her. In reality they were just soldiers  following commanders orders  who were discussing a political issue of power. She was just an excuse.<br /><br />The Cleopatra story was were I saw this film was to inaccurate and filled with propaganda. Here brother was a LOT younger. She was not obsessed with poison  was quite educated to restore library content  and was politically competitive to drag beaten down Egypt out of dirt.<br /><br />The part with Nero and praying Christians in a cave were disgusting. Yes  Rome burned down. Yes  there was persecuted Christianity. But the way they portray it was as if the Coliseum build itself and there was no Vespasian to rebuild Rome.<br /><br />Attila the Hun appears in a short seen and than we jump to King Arthur. The crusades are mentioned with minimal bloodshed. And there is no mention of the crusades east to Russia that ended in an ironic battle. The knights just went home and started jousting for fun of it. A LOT of stuff is put down like no indoor pluming  hygiene and plagues.<br /><br />Then they cover Joan of Ark  where she always has to much makeup and looks like a princes. Territorial politics were replaced with an unjust court. The sidesaddle alone on a stool makes me want to ask how someone could follow here. At here burning I wanted to yell Hura! Now die already! Cheap special effects, where is the fire?.<br /><br />By the time they mentioned Leonardo I already got fed up with the movie. Columbus  Spanish slaughter of America  yelling Queen Elisabeth kick the Spanish armada and so on and so on.<br /><br />The ONLY reason I wanted to see this movie was the fact that it was the last one with all 3 Marks brothers. And all they got was the scene with Manhattan and Indians. Amusing  but no more than a smile.<br /><br />The witch-hunts are mentioned briefly  as well as plagues (after renascence). When they start portraying revolutions  things gut power-hungry and anarchistic. The US revolution was pursued by the French revolution. Oppression and incompetence are bad  but you can't just blow the old way up out of anger  you must replace it with something. So they replaced the French monarchy with new French monarchy. So we get Napoleon and his ambitions to go to India by land. But they replace his motives with unity and band him for only the title Emperor. The conquests in Europe  defeat in Russia are sacked to Waterloo.<br /><br />The US civil war  the English rich inventors (Tesla not included). Mister Watson, come here, I want you almost made me laugh for teenage reasons. Technological hard work was watered down to the final discovery and comedic misuse.<br /><br />Eventually after 85 minutes we come to world wars and organized crime  but none of its horrors. Adolph's words I invade Russia. This is my last territorial demand were hilarious. It was his LAST territorial demand.<br /><br />To build suspense God puts a countdown clock to doomsday on the wall for the final words. All mighty cant pause the universe for a second? There was no need for the persecution speech but the defense made one last throw.<br /><br />Last we see the man of tomorrow as the final defense. Apparently a paradox man  because the bomb was to go of today. His toys are a music box in the shape of a gun and a pencil box sword. Now that is so wrong Pens and pencils drew so many weapon blueprints that its kill count surpasses the atom bomb. And making music out of a weapon? Deluded egoistic generals make music out of weapon fire. So the man of tomorrow is already a monster.<br /><br />The way I see it  all the defense had to do was blame the devil as the true conspirator for mans demise and case closed. And honestly  compared to all barbaric stuff our ancestors did centuries ago we are pretty humane at painless backstabbing these days.<br /><br />To summarize all I will just quote Fireflys episode Jaynestown: It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of son of bitch or another. Ain't about you, Jayne. It's about what they need.",negative
"I can't understand why many seem to hate this.<br /><br />This movie ties together many of the overlapping settings of the historical and Biblical epics of the fifties  using set pieces  props  and costumes similar to those seen in other movies. Here  however  the story attempts to run through all of human history  with a frame story about the human race being on trial  with a guilty verdict meaning h-bombs will go off all over the world. The prosecutor is the devil  played with fiendish glee by Vincent Price. OK  so it's a little hokey calling the defender The Spirit of All Men, but I think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm. The Spririt of Man is incidentally played quite well by Ronald Coleman  in his last film. It is also the last movie in which Groucho  Harpo  and Chico Marx all appear  but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Minuet buying Manhattan from the Indians  in a scene played purely for campy humor. Chico isn't funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat  and Harpo  we are told  is meant to be Isaac Newton  discovering gravity. Most of the other performances are well done  though.<br /><br />Other hokey things are that the trial is supposedly taking place in outer space  which is depicted as a region of clouds and blueness. There is something called The Great Clock of Outer Space, which  when striking midnight  may signal the end of the world.<br /><br />But at its heart  the movie addresses the problems of WMDs and the eternal question of whether Man is basically good  or basically evil; and poses it in what I think is an interesting way. Also  anyone who likes the look of costume epics of the fifties should like the look of this movie.",negative
"When I was 8 years old  and going through my Marx Brothers phase  my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers film  The Big Store late on Friday night  and set the VCR to tape it for me. When I woke up on Saturday -- due no doubt to a misprint in the TV guide -- my father and I discovered The Story of Mankind had been recorded instead.<br /><br />The Big Store was probably one of the least funny of all the Marx Brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the century's finest works of cinema when compared with The Story of Mankind. I can almost justify TV Guide's error  in that the Marx Brothers -- Groucho  Chico  and Harpo -- appear in both movies. Although in The Story of Mankind, they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit  Chico plays some guy talking to Christopher Columbus  and Harpo plays Isaac Newton????? Harpo's scene lasts about half a minute; Chico only has two or three lines; Groucho's scene is at least funny  but horribly racially insensitive by today's standards. The rest of the movie doesn't bear mentioning. They trotted out some of the finest actors of the day  and made them recite total garbage. What a disappointment.<br /><br />TV Guide  I sent you a nice letter  I'm still waiting for an apology.<br /><br />For the record: The Big Store has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on roller skates  and a couple of songs by Virginia O'Brien. I was really looking forward to seeing it.",negative
Irwin Allen's first venture into all star spectacle was one all star disaster. The Story of Mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. Virginia Mayo as the blond Cleopatra  Dennis Hopper chewing the scenery with Napoleon  Peter Lorre dining on the scenery for weeks as Nero  Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as a roadshow Marilyn Monroe  that's just some of them.<br /><br />The film also is known for being the last film which featured all three of the Marx Brothers though they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk who is Christopher Columbus's confidante  Groucho euchres the Indians out of Manhattan island as Peter Minuit  and most astonishing of all  Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton who discovers gravity when an apple conks him on the bean. <br /><br />Holding all these portrayals together is a story where mankind itself is being judged. A super H Bomb is about to be discovered and let loose will do in the world's population. It's Judgement Day a coming.<br /><br />But mankind has its advocates and detractors. Speaking for the prosecution is Old Scratch who's been bringing the worst out in man for centuries in the form of Vincent Price. But man has his good side as well and who better than Ronald Colman to demonstrate man at his most civilized best. Colman and Price plead their case before The Judge played by Cedric Hardwicke. <br /><br />In those three individuals you have some of the finest speaking voices the English language ever knew. When the film is on them as they each bring out the exhibits for their case it's a pleasure to listen to. Then when the focus is on the individual stories  you want to scream in agony.<br /><br />What was Irwin Allen driving at  I'm still trying to figure it out. Was he deliberately camping it up with some of these casting decisions? If it was satire  it just doesn't get off the ground.<br /><br />This was Ronald Colman's farewell film and while it's hardly something I'd like to go out on  I can't think of any man who could have stated the case for civilization any better. <br /><br />So when you see The Story of Mankind  fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment the advocates are before the judge.,negative
Pretty  stereotyped  good looking cast  the story loops in a wide and confusing arc  leading you down a number of garden paths (without attendant fairies) before plummeting to an end that feels you leaving - hollow.<br /><br />If you are after a film that has climax or ends with a satisfying thump  this is going to be a disappointment. Inspite of the main character's notionally overt sexuality I felt that he was androgynous  lacking a clear male persona  rather like his lacking of a clear French persona. Even though he is notionally laid naked (or rather sat naked) at the end of the film  the viewer is as unaware as the character as to motivations - that little thing called plot. Probably a stereotypically English speaking point of view  at least if you take the side of the film.,negative
L'Auberge Espagnole is less funny and less interesting than any episode of Dobie Gillis. Where is their Bob Denver? Do they even have a Dwayne Hickman? A French man moves to Barcelona to attend classes. He moves in with some other students who are no more interesting than himself  and they do and say uninteresting things. This movie is unbelievably bland. The only bright spot was a pretty French girl who played a Belgian lesbian. She places her hands behind her head and reveals shaven underarms  not the usual tufts of dark  smelly hair. But bare armpits does not a good movie make. L'Emmerdeur was funny  so was La Cage aux Folles. L'Auberge Espagnole and Le Placard makes you wonder what is going wrong with French comedy.,negative
I have seen previous movies from Cédric Klapisch  and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth. Having been an Erasmus student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad  I know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time. Yes  it is great fun! Because of that I thought I should not miss this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed to find that L'Auberge Espagnol fails to satisfy in many ways: the characters are stereotyped  the events are trite and the story is shallow. Although there are quite a few familiar situations  they are irritatingly cliché and do not go beyond the trivial events. This made the movie uninteresting to watch  and gave me a strong been-there-done-that-don't-you-have-anything-to-add? feeling. Apart from that  the movie lacks a firm story. It sometimes looks more like a documentary or 'real-life' show than a seriously made movie.<br /><br />However  I can imagine that if you haven't studied or travelled abroad  this might be fun to watch.,negative
"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie  having spent a few (fantastic) college weeks in Barcelona myself. The premise is right on cue--a confused & disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused & disordered young individuals. But the director's weak swats at symbolism  philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark  and it leaves us  the audience  feeling confused & disordered. Bravo.<br /><br />Perhaps if this movie had been presented as a European American Pie flick  then I'd be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride. But right off the bat  the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the inner self vs. the public self (one's mother tongue vs. one's secondary language). Furthermore  it dives boldly into the subject of racial/national stereotyping. Off to an interesting start  eh?<br /><br />WRONG. That's as far as it goes. These interesting topics are hardly mentioned again except at the contrived epilogue-type ending which seemed to be the director's way of floundering to get back on topic. It reminded me of a meandering speech which goes nowhere  but the speaker ends by saying  So in conclusion, I hope you see how this relates to my original thought!<br /><br />Furthermore  as other reviewers have pointed out  the cynical jab at stereotyping betrays itself. If the point is to ridicule the use of national stereotypes  then why did the director introduce a cockney-speaking  beer-swilling English brat as a caricature of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a neanderthal (literally banging his chest & making ape noises at one point) whilst the Europeans tolerate him superciliously? Why is the British girl the one who sinks to uttering slurs (calling French people frogs and butchering the French language) while everyone else is above all that? The answer is that this isn't a deep or well-thought out film. It's simply an Anglophobe's retort to the Anglophiles. But really it's no different from the prejudice it seeks to ridicule! Now there's a funny irony to consider.<br /><br />OK  philosophy  artistry & socio-political commentary aside  I was still very bored by this movie. There is one very funny gag which involves deceiving one of the girls' boyfriends  but aside from that I was hardly entertained at all. The only reason why I watched it through to the end is that I'd like to brush up on my French & Spanish. (You see  we monolingual Americans may be stupid  but we do try.)",negative
"Not a terrible movie... But there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a good thing for a action/thriller. The acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator  and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent military/police/sheriff/agent/marshal figure. The special effects are well  special - for example  the external train shots are very obviously a model train.<br /><br />Goofs: A meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene. The car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch. After the impact  the meteor is lodged in the top of the car's hood - impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at.<br /><br />Spoilers...<br /><br />A good portion of the movie's events are predictable  from the helicopter crash (Pull up, pull up!)  to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end  to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train  to the sequel set-up at the end.<br /><br />The scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious. They are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the Monty Python rabbit? Spoiler Goof: In one scene four people shooting clip after clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. Later in the movie Todd Bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range. On several occasions  Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands.",negative
We brought this film as a joke for a friend  and could of been our worst joke to play. The film is barely watchable  and the acting is dire. The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance. The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on. It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable.<br /><br />Just terrible,negative
"I did my best to watch this two hour fiasco. It combined the awful special effects and plot of the original Blob, with an execrable boosting of the (outstanding in the original) screenplay of Runaway Train. The only explanation for this movie is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and figured they'd combine it with a shot at hosting a casting couch. What an incredible stinker! Lou Diamond Phillips is anxious to show us why he will take any part  no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as a typecast creep  a U.S. Senator from Texas and plays it well. He should next do the lead role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. The women in this flick all seem to have gotten their roles as consolation prizes in the Fay Wray Memorial screaming contest. Special effects are unbelievably bad. H.S. kids in film class in North Dakota could have done a better job. The writers must have pulled a heist at the cliché bank to accumulate this many. I couldn't watch any more without being forced to sit in the Clockwork Orange chair. I have no idea how it ended  except obviously  119 minutes too late. Ugh! Caveat emptor.",negative
We all know that special effects cost money  but it seems as if they could have used the money they saved writing the script to get some better shots. The train is obviously a model in most moving shots  the helicopter is obviously computer generated  the alien looks like the one from the end of Spaceballs  except it's a decade later and Spaceballs had an excuse.<br /><br />The only smart thing they did was blur all of the special effects to make them harder to see.<br /><br />Not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and it's pretty obvious they didn't really try either.<br /><br />Please  don't waste your time. Please.,negative
*THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS... OR MAYBE NOT. THE WARNING IS THE SAME FOR ALL*<br /><br />Dang it. Just when I thought that SCIFI Channel had used all of its ridiculous ideas for movies  they give us THIS. Actually  the plot itself it's nothing we haven't seen in movies like Snakes On A Plane  Deep Blue Sea  etc... That means  a monster/animal/menace of some kind is lurking in a close environment threatening a bunch of people. In this case  an alien in a train. Wow.<br /><br />I must say that  when I first saw this thing on cable  I couldn't stop laughing. No SCIFI film had prepared me for this; it was so incredibly pathetic I couldn't believe it! The actors are all a bunch of stereotypical-genre characters. But since they're not so famous (to say the least)  I wasn't expecting much of them. Except Diamond Phillips. No comments there  but I think the guy was desperate to find a job. The problem was something called 'special effects'  horrible even for SCIFI Channel standards. That model/toy they made us believe it was a real train (not to mention the model/toy helicopter  bigger than a train's wagon)  the meteor coming HORIZONTALLY from space  the 'baby' alien (a sock puppet  and I ain't kiddin')  the regular aliens who looked pretty ugly... while they were static; when they started moving  it was awful  the explosions (the terrorist blew up LITERALLY! And what about the exploding helicopter! Just how many barrels of gas was that thing carrying?)  the insane mathematics used (they couldn't even solve a school problem right!)... And I won't talk about that doomsday-like ending  by that time I didn't know if to keep laughing or to start crying. If I remember right  I did both.<br /><br />It's an ideal movie to have a good laugh  alone or with friends. But be warned; it's so ridiculous at SO MANY levels... and you need a heck of a lot of suspension of disbelief...,negative
Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of awe  shock  pity and  yes  sheer terror. To think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this. The horror  the horror.<br /><br />Tell me if any of this sounds familiar.<br /><br />A train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to Las Vegas for a big rally for the candidate  a Senator from Texas (Barry Corbin  the only actor with roles both ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass.<br /><br />The train stops. Local law enforcement is summoned. Oh  can it be? The Senator has a lovely young lady (Amy Locane from CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER  LA BAMBA) is the ex-husband.<br /><br />Meanwhile eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the train.<br /><br />The train leaves. Lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that Lou can drop onto the moving train (about 70 miles per hour) so that he can save the day. As the buddy's reward  he crashes the helicopter into the mountain.<br /><br />Which is another example of how poorly written ALIEN EXPRESS is. The cop hero's sidekick must die  we all know that. But he's supposed to die near the end of the third act  usually while saving several lives.<br /><br />Once on the train  Lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel Bruce Willis in DIE HARD by wearing a wife beater t-shirt. Yeah  Lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym. The part he's playing isn't worth bothering with  but he's in good shape.<br /><br />The Senator is going to have an afternoon delight with Miss Utah  but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate price.<br /><br />Soon we have bomb threats  multiplying aliens  and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT STROKES) try to save as many lives as they can.<br /><br />There is exactly one surprise in the entire movie. Early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty-fifth anniversary  with hopes for thirty-five more years together. The dude gets banged up  but he and the Mrs. both live. Maybe the writers just lost track of them.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall. These actors who have done better work (and  really  deserve much better than this) are probably just happy for the work. Did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile  or did they cry (and/or drink) themselves to sleep at night? At the end of the story the (fairly numerous  all things considered) survivors gather in the last car of the train  which is unhooked. The other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff.<br /><br />Lou and his ex are reunited. Happiness reigns. I'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet  but I digress.<br /><br />Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. Look  make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. The Earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere.<br /><br />It's gotten to a point that seeing the words The Sci-Fi Channel Presents on an original movie tells us that we'll be glad we have Ti-Vo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours. Or  better yet  just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely.,negative
It is way beyond me how this script was ever sold much less produced and distributed. The dialogue was so bad it was sickening. The train and helicopter scenes appeared to have been done on flash cards by high school students. Lou Diamond Phillips must have hidden under his seat when this --- this movie? was shown at a private screening afterwhich he most likely left by the back door. The only emotion it aroused in me was pity for the cast  they had to bite the bullet to get through this one. I couldn't stand to watch all of it  it was so predictable that it was funny. Who knows maybe it will be picked up by one of the networks as a situation comedy.,negative
This is fairly typical for the Sci-Fi Channel: one-dimensional characters  a ridiculous plot  and terrible special effects. We've got some alien sock puppets loose on a train  and Lou Diamond Phillips does his best with what little he's given to eke out a performance. And save the day. Everyone else in this is utterly dispensable; the ex-wife who goes through the time-honored cliché of first disliking Lou  then of course comes to love him again at the end. The obnoxious State Senator who gets munched early on  and a gaggle of dull security guards who run around a lot. Then there's an eco-terrorist who is in this movie for absolutely no reason whatsoever  except to provide us with 3% more running around. He spends the whole middle part of the movie hiding in a box.<br /><br />The special effects really deserve their own paragraph. We start with a meteorite that flies through the air  trailing flames behind it  at about 100 miles per hour. According to the physics of this movie  if you exceed the posted speed limit in your car  atmospheric friction may cause you to burst into flames. Then it lands on the hood of a car  coming in horizontally. Sort of like a velcro ball landing on a velcro floor I guess. It really doesn't damage the car much  just bends up the hood a little bit. Later on Lou gets in a helicopter and goes chasing after the train. Even though the train only had a two minute head start  it takes a good half hour to catch it. The CGI is so bad that the helicopter looks like it's as big as the hills it's flying over. Then it flies into the side of a mountain - this effect must be seen to be believed. It looks like they took a jar of gasoline and threw it against a wall  then superimposed the flame effect over the helicopter. About 10 times too big. No wonder the helicopter couldn't pull up in time  it was carrying five tons of nitro glycerine. Then the eco-terrorist eventually blows himself up  but instead of exploding in all directions like most explosions do  he explodes upwards like a cannon aimed into the air. Then there's the whole deal with not being able to stop the train because that would allow the little aliens to get off  but it appears that the aliens can actually fly faster than the train is traveling  so why this would keep them on the train I have no idea.<br /><br />Overall  if you've got a couple of hours that absolutely need killing  and it's down to this movie or reruns on the Food Network  well  come to think of it  some of those chefs are kind of cute. Usually these movies have at least one or two things about them that make it possible to sit through them; maybe there's a sexy girl  some T&A  or a character that actually has some personality  or some suspense or  well  something. I really didn't see any of that here.,negative
What do you get when you put Lou Diamond Philips  Todd Bridges  Barry Corbin with a bad toupee  and an alien all on a train? You get a very bad movie called Alien Express or Dead Rail that would be more entertaining on Comedy Central's old series Mystery Science Theater 3000. You name it  this awful movie suffered in areas of acting  plot  storyline  and special effects. In fact  the exterior passenger train shots looked like the production staff used a common HO scale model in front of a painted background! The rest of the special effects goes downhill from there.<br /><br />The plot is very predictable and is similar to two 1970's movies called Horror Express and a disaster movie called The Cassandra Crossing. At least The Cassandra Crossing had a better cast  an engaging storyline  and real train scenes.<br /><br />If you want a good laugh and a movie to mock at a B movie party then watch this; otherwise  Alien Express derailed long before departing from the station!,negative
I am a big fan of sci-fi movies. So  when I saw this movie in the EPG  I thought I was in for a pleasant evening. What a disappointment ! Such a poor display of special effects I could not imagine in 1980  but in 2005 ? Come on  why would you do special effects of an helicopter flying in the desert when you can film a real one for a much lower price (I guess) ? And those killer muppets... well  I could do better than that in a couple of hours in the garage. You can expect to have a low budget on a movie  but I don't think it's reasonable to have a low movie for any budget. As for the star of the movie (I use a lot of quotes tonight...)  Lou Diamond Philips  the guy is not even remotely an actor. Maybe he should have stayed to the martial arts movies. All in all  an awful movie. Maybe I am in a bad mood tonight. Then again  maybe not. A sincere 1 out of 10.,negative
A tough sell: British playwright Ronald Harwood adapts his autobiographical stage drama into loud  bellowing film about WWII Shakespearean theatrical troupe saddled with an aged  blustery  brilliant-but-unreliable star at the end of his tether. The actor's effete assistant works diligently to get his master coiffed and costumed for a production of King Lear (during an Air Raid!)  yet both men are losing their grip on their unraveling situation. Based on the waning years of actor Donald Wolfit  whose dresser was Ronald Harwood  this acclaimed production would seem to be a welcome haven for scenery-chewing thespians. Unfortunately  Albert Finney (at this point in his career  not at all elderly) seems too robust and quick-thinking to play the actor; Finney (and Oscar-nominated director Peter Yates) cannot modulate Sir's moods and bouts of coherency in a way that makes sense to us  so that in one scene he's stopping a train with the commanding echo of his voice  and in the next he's curiously falling apart. With such a wreck of a human being in the midst of failing health and aptitude  one would assume a dedicated assistant would go to great lengths to protect his boss (and his future)  yet servant Tom Courtenay prods and badgers and goads Finney to carry on rather than rest. Courtenay  who played this part on stage (and was nominated for an Oscar alongside Finney for Best Actor)  is far more attuned to his role  and eventually his bleating commands and confusion achieve the only real feeling in the film. These two  thankfully  do not peck at each other's heads  and scenarist Harwood is careful not to fall into a love-hate pattern (which could possibly be perceived in the film's first act); but  without a juxtaposition of servant vs. celebrity  there's nothing much to behold in this portrait except for the deterioration of narcissism  the hint at what once was. *1/2 from ****,negative
This is a truly awful film. Lou Diamond Phillips simply calls this one in. The use of miniature models of the train are laughable. The plot seems to develop on the run (there is an alien on board; oh  and an eco-terrorist is on board too; oh  and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control; oh  and the train is going to run into another train one hour ahead; oh  and that train has nuclear waste on it...). I mean  come on really! The alien monsters are not scary (although there are a lot of them)  and the acting is abysmal. Check out the guy playing the next President - do you really think he could be President? For goodness sake  he has spent his whole acting career playing bad guys!,negative
"Eh-heh eh-heh hey, dude - look at these aliens. They're like - biting the humans and stuff! Eh-heh eh-heh eh-heh <br /><br />This must rank amongst the worst movies of all time. It's utter drivel for anyone with a modicum of a brain. Sure  you have the reviewers on the payroll who give glowing reviews and vote highly for this abomination but it's easy to tell who these sell-outs are. Their reviews are TOO good. To give a movie like this even a mediocre review claiming it had some B-movie remedial appeal would be a glowing review! Calling this a great movie tips the hands of the corporate shills.<br /><br />But enough of that.<br /><br />This movie had about all the bad characteristics a movie can have without being SO bad that it's enjoyable just to laugh at. The old Japanese 60's monster films had a quality that this movie lacked. At least in those 60's films you could laugh at just how bad the rubber monster suit looked. Or laugh at seeing the strings holding the space ships  how the models dangled on the strings and how the flames curved UPWARDS out of the back. Those movies made fun of how BAD they were. Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) seems to actually think of itself as a GOOD movie - which makes it incredibly absurd.<br /><br />The effects were awful by today's standards. Beyond awful. However not quite as bad as the 60's monster movies hence they lacked the comedic appeal. The plot and dialogue were about as sophomoric as I've ever seen  made even worse by being every bit as predictable as you might expect. I won't even point out the plot and logic holes in this one; it just wouldn't be fair to this pitiable plot (plus it would take to long to even get started). Most of the acting was awful; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch this one.<br /><br />SciFi Channel is rapidly becoming the cheap thrills channel  producing movie after movie without an iota of concept or intelligence in the lot. I can only wonder - why bother?<br /><br />Don't bother with this tripe. It doesn't get any worse.",negative
Alien Express is one of the worst movies I've bothered to experience.<br /><br />The plot is predictable. The aliens look like rubber sock puppets. The effects would have been mediocre in the 70's  but are just atrocious by today's standards. Couldn't they take a shot of a real train instead of using an obvious model?<br /><br />The acting isn't great but  really  the dialogue is the worst part. It gouges its way into your mind. Don't you die on me. Not now. If you ever manage to suspend disbelief long enough to be absorbed into the movie  you'll rapidly be jolted painfully back to reality by the aliens  the model train  or the clichéd dialogue.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1 is that it doesn't deserve to be rated so badly that some poor suckers might watch it for the pleasure inherent in a truly bad film.,negative
After watching this movie on tv  I looked it up in the IMDB and imagine to my surprise a user rating of 7.6! This is not a good film. Especially bad is the editing; the poor way the story jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction. It's not very fluently done. I do agree that the acting was fairly decent  especially Kelly Kapowski  and that the story was intriguing enough.,negative
This only gets bashed because it stars David Hasselhoff. Well  then let me bash it to. Compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays  this film isn't too bad. It has the beautiful Leslie Cumming. She is super hot  but can't talk very well. There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped. She shows off her nice body. Linda Blair does nothing here as well as Hasselhoff. 3/10,negative
"Some Plot Spoilers Ahead.<br /><br />The Nashville Network's so-called rebirth as The First Network for Men is a complete disappointment  as was its block of adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy was just plain awful  Gary the Rat mediocre at best  and Stripperella pretty unwatchable. This cartoon is mostly boring; if Ren and Stimpy suffered from gross-out overkill  Stripperella lacked any decent shock gags  funny witless gags  clever gags  or gags  period. The concept is bad to begin with: Pamela Anderson  a stripper-cum-superheroine  saves The City from an assortment of goofy supervillains. This cartoon seems like an homage to superior wacky superhero spoofs  like Darkwing Duck and The Tick, but without those cartoons' wit and good writing---or even good storyboarding. Agent 0069 tries to vacillate between being goofy and sexy  but she is neither  and this cartoon's failure to make her one or the other brings this series down.<br /><br />Watch your taped episodes of The Tick, and see what a real superhero spoof cartoon is like.",negative
The first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible acting. The whole cast was so uniformly inept at delivering their lines that I started laughing at the awful dialog midway through the film. An even bigger issue with this movie is that at no point do we ever find out what motivates the actions of each character. The one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is Halfdan Hussey's innovative visual effects. However  as eye-catching as they may be  they do little to make up for the gaping flaws mentioned above. A dreadful script mixed with community theater level acting does not make for a pleasant viewing. I was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was.,negative
I thought of this movie when i watched pluto nash...why..because both movies have randy quaid playing a retarded robot  this movie made years earlier but probably written by a screenplay writer that drank the same biotoxic coffee or something like that...Whoa...AVOID AT ALL COSTS even to pay tribute to the late great Andy Kaufman is hard to do here...find another film or just watch taxi reruns on latenight tv...his latka gravas character is so much more loveable...TANK YOU BERRY MUCH,negative
My wife and I saw this in the theater when it first came out.<br /><br />There were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same time.<br /><br />This is the only movie I have ever walked out on.<br /><br />It was just painful to sit through.<br /><br />The theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refund.<br /><br />Never had that happen before or since Pleae do not rent this You will really regret it I am really sureprised by the vote summary Perhaps personal tast has something to do with it,negative
I presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry. - VAL<br /><br />Mike Nelson made me watch this...he mentioned it in his book  Movie Megacheese. I asked myself  Why would Mike Nelson steer me wrong? I now know why the bots never trusted Mike Nelson.<br /><br />The music is by John Williams  which is probably part of his payment to the Devil. In fact  I'm sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol' Slewfoot  or is now cursed  from the Executive Director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio. Don't watch...for the love of God...don't watch!!! Not even making a copy and showing someone else will un-curse you...I'm doomed now  I understand this. I accept this. But save yourself...,negative
If you like bad movies  this one's a real treat. Kaufman & Peters stagger around in robot costumes  escape slavery only to wander aimlessly  and find true robot love. I believe this is the first movie that ever made me consider walking out. I should note I was 12  and could be entertained by shiny objects.,negative
I really wanted to like this movie  but the pacing was just way too slow.<br /><br />It was a nice story  but it was really like watching a slug race.<br /><br />The movie would have been better served  if it had some more action. I don't mean anything grand  but at least something in the background.<br /><br />It could have also been helped by songs that set the tone/mood of the more lengthy periods that were absent of dialogue.<br /><br />It's been about 10 years since I've seen it  so I may have to give it another chance.<br /><br />3/10 or *1/2(out of four),negative
Little did I know that when I signed up the the all pay channel package with Direct TV that I would face a movie like this. It came on right after another movie we had been watching... and I was a teenager in 1981 so am not sure where I was at the time... but I missed this movie.<br /><br />I also can't believe we left it on. It is kind-of funny as it takes you back in the time machine to the early 80s... but I think even then this would have been a painful movie. It was just... well... too cute! ET was cute in a way... but not obnoxiously cute... and stupid.<br /><br />When I see a movie like this... I come on onto IMDb to see what others say. I am blown away that this thing was nominated! Wow... the movie industry has come a long way since the 80s! Oh well... it did show some old actors... btw that is the other thing I was surprised about... the lineup... not a bunch of no-names... but some real actors/actresses. Must have been in their drug days! Anyways... odd  interesting  bizarre  and makes one happy they grew up!,negative
To sum this movie up  it is LaBute carrying his sadism over into the realm of comedic farce. The predictable result is that he is constantly stepping on all the jokes by insisting on surrounding them with blood-curdling violence and extremely hateful characters. There is also evidence of his continuing efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight but then to apologize for it with weak gestures to the PC. Basically the movie just doesn't work  its plot is beyond contrived  the characters are one-dimensional cliches  there is no consistency or development of anything  and the comedy (where it is not totally out of place) is the worst kind of High Concept drivel.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are completely wasted on characters that seem like parodies of studio-driven audience pandering--no matter what  make them likeable  neutral (and neutered)  and full of moral platitudes. Crispin Glover is in here just long enough to convince you that he doesn't belong in movies anymore. Chris Rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman Freeman--it's as if they are acting in different rooms even when they are two inches away from each other. In effect  Chris Rock seems like a digital insert. At least he isn't as annoying as Jar-Jar.<br /><br />LaBute's 15 minutes may well be up by now. It's already looking like he's overstayed his welcome.,negative
I watched this movie purely for the setting. It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of. The plot was predictable  the acting was mediorcre at best  the scares were all gross-outs  not true scares.<br /><br />I don't remember much of the plot  and I think that's because there wasn't much of one to remember. They didn't even use the hotel to it's fullest potential...The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula. At low tide  you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay  which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks.<br /><br />The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action (and I'm using that term loosly)scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings!,negative
Renee Zellweger is radiant  but the rest of this movie just does not work. It's like a hamburger-jello-mold salad--interesting idea  but who ever thought it would actually work on film? I like director LaBute's two previous films--they were mercilessly honest and chillingly funny. This film manages only to be merciless and chilling--with jumbo dollops of the cutes. (As high concept  think: the Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie Sam Peckinpah might have made--now reduce your expectations to match the present  mass-produced state of Hollywood.) That actors as talented as Freeman  Kinnear  Eckhart  Vince  and Janney ALMOST make their scenes come alive is a testament to the immensity of their talents to rise above material that just does not cohere. I would have found Freeman's corny  feel-good-about-yourself speech at the end of the movie funny (in a Lynchean way) if it weren't for the nagging suspicion that this unconvincingly tacked-on moral is meant to be accepted seriously.,negative
Okay  this movie starts out and it *looks* like it's going to be a cute comedy about a completely obsessed soap opera fan. She has no touch with reality whatsoever outside of the soap (sort of the inverse of the main characters in Pleasantville) and runs away to Los Angeles to meet a fictional character. Well it is a cute movie... but at the same time  it is ALSO a dark  very violent movie about two hitmen who are out to kill Betty for reasons way to complex to recount here. Either plotline would have been enough on it's own  but Nurse Betty contains both stories at once  and the effect is very jarring. I didn't much enjoy it.,negative
I was pretty enthusiastic about seeing this movie when it came out. Commercials for it made it look quirky and I generally like Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock  and the combination of the two seemed like an interesting idea. Sadly  I was terribly disappointed with Nurse Betty.<br /><br />Personally  I've usually found that graphic violence and comedy don't go all that well together  and the only directors that have ever combined the two successfully  in my opinion  are Tarantino and the Coens. There isn't that much violence in Nurse Betty  but what violence is in it made me feel kind of weird when I was supposed to laugh. Of course  for me  part of the problem was also that there didn't seem to be many places where I was being asked to.<br /><br />The film doesn't much work as a drama  either. Renee Zellweger's Betty  the story's protagonist  is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way. I will say Zellweger acts the role quite well  and Freeman  Rock  and Greg Kinnear all do good jobs too. The problem is in the writing; Freeman is the only person that gets to play an interesting character. It's really too bad. 3/10,negative
A wildly uneven film where the major problem is the uneasy mix of comedy and thriller. To me  the unusual premise is clearly a comedic one  and they should have gone for an all-out comedy. For example  Rock has some funny lines but occasionally he is too unlikable for a comedy. The scene where Betty's husband gets scalped is too nasty for what should have been a less violent comedy. An even better example is the Hollywood leftist writer preaching to us tritely through Freeman's character  early on  about the plight of the Indians; I mean - yawn! They should have given Freeman something funny to say in that segment  but that is of course much more difficult than to simply write him a boring PC speech.<br /><br />There is yet more New Age PC-ness in the form of the ending: the girl not only doesn't get the boy - she gets no boy at all; in fact  the message is that the girl needs no boy at all! Bit of a feminist statement there. The first half-hour is weak  but the movie gets better - ironically - once Zellweger gets to Kinnear. I say ironically because I'm not much of a fan of Kinnear's  though he's solid here. Zellweger is very cute  as usual; she has the sort of all-American cute looks which should appeal to almost every guy  and I have to wonder why more of such women aren't represented nowadays  instead of the dogs who inexplicably became stars  such as Diaz  Roberts  Aniston  Lopez  or Barrymore.<br /><br />Since the movie tries to be very serious at times  I have no choice but to criticize Freeman's character which is the gangster's equivalent of the movie world's hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold. There is also absolutely nothing in the relationship between Freeman and Rock to suggest even remotely that they were father and son.,negative
By the standards of Hollywood this movie was filmed and edited as Hollywood movies are and therefore looked like a movie you would get out of a big-time production studio within Hollywood. Thats where anything remotely close to having Hollywood standards ends. This was THE WORST MOVIE I have EVER seen in MY LIFE! I am not joking. The story was so unbelievably stupid and unrealistic that I could not contain my laughter in the movie theater through the course of watching this film. I know what you're saying  its a horror film its not supposed to have a good story it's supposed to scare you. Well let me tell you something  the movie is not even scary in the least bit. Its too full of stupid bits that cancels out the little suspense there may have been. The acting was awful as well  along with the scariness of the murderer  who you constantly see through flashbacks locked in a cage jacking off. Throughout the movie I kept getting a sense I was watching something that was thought up  written  produced  and directed by a high-schooler who watches too much pornography. Please  don't see this movie  spend your $8.50 on other things  like a snow cone  which would be much more worth your while.,negative
Compared to the recent gore flick HOSTEL  which this movie reminded me a lot of-- I would say that See No Evil is slightly better but not by much. The very complex plot involves a handful of delinquents who are sent to clean up a rundown hotel for a shorter jail sentence. The kids soon end up being killed off by a lumbering religious psychopath who is cleansing them of their sins (I guess). The one thing I dreaded most prior to seeing this was the fact that it stared a WWE wrestler  Kane. He ended up doing a decent job considering he only had 2 one-word lines in the movie. There are a couple fairly gory moments  mainly involving eye-gouging and a quite memorable scene in which a girl gets a cellphone shoved down her throat-- probably the most effective demise in the movie.<br /><br />I can't say that this movie really shows us anything new and is definitely far from great. Can't recommend it.,negative
The Cheesiest movie I've ever seen  Not scary  just bad. 1st movie made by the WWE  and trust me the only person this movie might appeal to is wrestling fans. It has terrible acting and The worst directing I've seen yet.I Found myself laughing at the storyline  and bad actors. I saw that the WWE people tried really hard to Put a lot of the wrestling moves in the kills  and Several camera effects. I think they copied a lot from silent Hill. This movie's not engaging either  so If you do see it  you're gonna find yourself tuning out because of it's lack of Suspense. The ending's the worst  No matter what  you'll come out wanting your money back,negative
Porn legend Gregory Dark directs this cheesy horror flick that has Glen Jacobs (Kane from WWF/WWE/ whatever it calls itself nowadays) in his cinematic debut. He plays Jacob Goodknight  a blind serial killer who's forte is taking people's eyes out. The plot  be it as it may  has a group of troubled youths cleaning up the historical hotel that GoodKnight resides in and subsequently being offed by him. Hemmingway it's not. Starts of as fun dopey B-movie  but soon gets too tedious to be enjoyable. Glad I went in with pretty low expectations  but even those weren't met. How can you have a porn king directing and still suffer from a lack of nudity??? for shame.<br /><br />My Grade: D- <br /><br />Eye Candy: Samantha Noble bares her ass briefly,negative
OK  lets start with the best. the building. although hard to believe it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire  the gruesome walls and odd items found throughout were interesting. other than that  its not worth it.<br /><br />as far as the bad  its done by WWE films. WTF? is that supposed to make you want to see it? if anything  stay away. horrible  horrible idea for them to make movies and allow Gregory Dark to direct it. bad choice. the previews beforehand were more interesting and entertaining.<br /><br />i cant even begin to discuss how bad this film is. untalented actors & a disappointing  vague storyline. apparently many of the actors are from that show all saints. its a wonder why i haven't ever heard of them or their show. other than that  the bus driver  which you never even see  just him closing the door  has had more action that just about everyone together. at least he handles stunts for some decent films.<br /><br />i like to see scary movies  i really do. but this one blew so much  the entire audience was laughing at it and cheering the characters on halfway through. very annoying. the child behind me was yelping more during the previews of other horror films.<br /><br />this is not a film to see  even less if you have to pay for it.,negative
I had no idea this movie was produced by WWE. Wrestling is lame enough. Why did they have to soil their name further by making a movie as crappy as this one was?? I found it to be a complete disappointment. If i had of known this movie was going to be as stupid as it was  I would have stayed home and done something more entertaining. Sure  I'll give them the credit of the cool effects; but the killer didn't seem as scary as he could have been. He lacked a number of things. But I'll let you point them out for yourselves. The plot was a great idea  just could have been done in a much better way. Maybe in the future  WWE will stick to its moronic wrestling and stay out of the film industry..,negative
I got stuck in traffic (I live in Sicily) on the way to the theater (at a military base) to see Superman Returns  was 15 minutes late  and the only other movie playing was See No Evil  there was no poster up for it  and just a short description of the movie on the schedule...but my girlfriend and I decided to check it out...As soon as I saw it was produced by WWE I just knew it was gonna be awful. The few people in the theater were laughing most of the time  and it was the first movie that I honestly considered walking out on  and I've seen The Ringer...okay  I would have walked out of that one  but I was too busy sleeping. The death of the bad guy at the end was pretty good  but other than that  it was just stupid.,negative
This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures. Sure  the effects are laughable  the story confused  but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun. I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in  it added to what little suspense was mustered. Give it a 3.,negative
Another movie with a star of a wrestling. So far I have noticed....wrestlers can't act on the movie screen. This movie is no exception.<br /><br />The action is dreadful. It makes you laugh at what they say  and they can't be serious  they try to act scared but they fail and look stupid. The acting is horrible  possibly from the bad director.<br /><br />The plot was stupid....Just some people get placed in a hotel because they're criminals  and they get randomly killed off. The movie is stupid all the way through  making it one of the worst I have ever seen.<br /><br />The only think and this is why I give it a 3 and not a 1 is because of the way Jacob Goodnight dies. The pole through the head and the stories of him plunging was awesome.<br /><br />Overall this is a really horrible movie  and you definitely shouldn't waste your time with it.,negative
After watching this movie  I have nothing but contempt for any of those who were involved in the making of this abysmal film. For one  as a general comment  the storyline was literally unbelievable and filled with incredible clichés all around. The same obviously goes for the dialogue which panders to the lowest common denominator and manages to offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. The acting was terrible as well with Kane showing  throughout the entire movie  at the very most 3 separate and distinct emotions. Even the use of modern special effects failed  as each prop was easily distinguishable from its real life counterpart. Overall  I would not recommend for anyone to even think about viewing this feature  as it will most surely waste 83(not even 90!) minutes of your life.,negative
The first official release of World Wrestling Entertainment's film division is a pretty basic horror/slasher movie called See No Evil starring Kane  one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence  hard-hitting moves  and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling. And let's not pull any punches here; while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time (mostly by WWE)  it goes without saying that after having seen this movie  I can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time.<br /><br />See No Evil sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up. Of course  a monstrous murderer (played by Kane) also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes. Without giving away too much of the movie plot  this film has all the semblance and structure of an early-1980s slasher flick with most of the clichés intact  but without any of the scares that those films accompany. And that's sort of the main problem with See No Evil. It tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable; veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next. It's too generic to be scary.<br /><br />The movie's gory  no doubt  but it's only there for the effect. The dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially  but as you get towards the end  it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly. The death scenes don't come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable  although some of them are pretty inventive.<br /><br />And the acting in this movie is pretty bad too  as the main characters aren't developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed. Some can't even portray fear properly; they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote. So when they die  it only adds to the comedy because you don't care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of Starfleet Redshirts to the monster Kane.<br /><br />As for Kane  he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character  only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone. There's no doubt in my mind that Kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre. He has the look and presence for it; he just needs better material (specifically a script that isn't written by someone who writes wrestling shows) to work with.<br /><br />Now  despite what may seem like a harsh review  I actually enjoyed the film. It's one of those laughably bad movies that you can't help but sit down and enjoy. My main gripe with the film  again  is that it's simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesn't have any frightening or shock moments. I enjoyed it  but I enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie. If that happens because it was supposed to be that way  the movie would have been rated higher. But it didn't. It got laughs because it's a B-movie and it doesn't help that the director's previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos; not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway. Nonetheless  I enjoyed it tremendously.<br /><br />If you don't mind a fun B-movie or funny horror film  I'd highly recommend See No Evil. If you are a true enthusiast of the genre  I'd wait until the DVD comes out before checking it out. Everyone else should probably go watch something else.,negative
Eight teen convicts are brought to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel to clean it out as community service. They soon discover that it's the residence of a hulking psychopath (Kane) who has a thing for pulling out and collecting eyeballs. It doesn't help that the guard watching over them (Steven Vidler) has had a previous run-in with the beast four years earlier. <br /><br />A guilty pleasure of mine are slasher films. Most of them are poorly directed and acted but they still hold some appeal and entertainment value. See No Evil is a good example of this. It features atrocious writing and acting but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining. The premise sounds like a mixture between Friday the 13th  Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea but it didn't work out too well. It was really just a bunch of clichés and everything was predictable. Screenwriter Dan Madigan just focused on the death scenes and nothing else apparently. The death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills. <br /><br />The acting is pretty bland and unremarkable. This is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we don't know much about them. It was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didn't do that good of a job. A second rate Jason Voorhees  if you will. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers. <br /><br />While the death scenes are gory  they aren't necessary scary. There's really no suspense just some gory death scenes. Because of this  the movie doesn't hold much of a repeat value. Also  if you don't like slasher films then don't waste your time with this one. It will do little to change your opinion. In the end  See No Evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so it's not exactly worth watching. Rating 6/10,negative
"All right  let's be realistic about this. Nobody goes into a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has challenged God to a wrestling match)  directed by a former porn director (the man gave the world the Between the Cheeks trilogy)  starring a wrestler named Kane  and expects a little slice of art on a golden platter. If you do then you probably need to find something other than watching movies to occupy your time.<br /><br />So what exactly are we to expect from a movie like this? Well  here's what I was looking forward to:<br /><br />1) Bad acting. 2) A fairly non-existent  clichéd storyline. 3) Kane walking around with a scrunched  sour face that indicates his nostrils just found the potato salad he misplaced a month ago. 4) Tons and tons of gore. <br /><br />Well  if you're hungry for some so bad it's funny entertainment then this might satisfy your appetite because it delivers on all counts.<br /><br />Obviously  movies like this are best seen for free  but if you do choose to sacrifice box office bucks then have some fun and make a game out of it. The filmmakers are nice enough to introduce us to each of the annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses on the screen. This makes it easier for you to write down which ones you want to see killed and in what order. You and your friends can see whose predictions are most accurate.<br /><br />I also suggest that you and your pals write down every single moment of stupidity and inanity that you can find. Tally them up at the end and see who comes up with the most. I think my grand total was 107; can you beat that? I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire does this abandoned hotel still have electricity  running water  and a working elevator?<br /><br />I know  I know  the filmmakers are assuming that if you pay to see this then you obviously don't put much thought into what you spend your money on and therefore likely won't put much thought into how silly the movie is  but that doesn't mean we can't point it out and laugh at it.<br /><br />I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any sensible inspector) into a homeless shelter and they think the best way to get it cleaned up is to give eight punks a few mops and brooms. Uh-huh.<br /><br />I think you pretty much know what to expect  but I feel the need to provide you with a couple of warnings. First  if you hate crowd interaction no matter the movie then you might want to stay away. The people in the audience acted like they were at an actual wrestling show. Shouts of Kill him, Kane! and I hope you die first! and Chokeslam! echoed through the theater  showcasing what I hope is NOT the best of what America has to offer. I usually don't appreciate such audience interaction  but for a cheesefest like this I thought the commentary added to the entertainment value. However  I can see how others could be annoyed by it.<br /><br />Second  and this shouldn't even warrant explanation  the film doesn't shy away from the gore. If watching a big ugly dude rip eyeballs right out of their sockets doesn't scream fun night at the movies! for ya then you know good and well to save your dough.<br /><br />I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on Kane's part. I wasn't expecting him to put on an acting clinic  but I was hoping he'd have some cute little catchphrase like Say goodnight (his character's last name is Goodnight) right before he killed a victim. Instead he uttered four words in the entire film - Nooooooo! and I see it. But hey  he delivered them flawlessly!<br /><br />If I were a bad guy in a movie then my catchphrase would be something like Place your BETTS! or All BETTS are off! <br /><br />It'd rule and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror films like See No Evil that induce so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to label them comedic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now we'll just call 'em HOR-larious!",negative
Ho humm - - - More of nothing. If you are a long-time Rush fan you know what this video contains: loathsome songs from the past  the BIG 3 hits from the 80's and their last-ditch efforts to remain contemporary. They do succeed in making fun of themselves by beating the critics to the punch by portraying themselves as dinosaurs. Unfortunately  they FAIL at protecting themselves from embarrassment. Close-ups of their faces only add to the fact that these guys HAVE BEEN.<br /><br />If you are have been following (as much as you can stomach) the band for a couple of decades from the 70's  then you know there is no new material here. Same old  same OLD: 1) Neil avoids the press  2) no real behind-the-scenes (Geddy looses his SHOES?! Give me a break! Even HE thinks it's absurd!) 3) no new insights.<br /><br />A better video would have been to show the CREW setting up for 3 or 4 hours  just let the camera run. And stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds! I understand the director wants to try to do something artsy. But then offer a full concert version of 2 or 3 shots the VIEWER can choose. We know what the band looks like  let us see what WE REALLY want to see.<br /><br />Do yourself a BIG favor: RENT this movie first.,negative
In comparison to other sand and sandal fare  The Egyptian leaves much to be desired. The film is very LOOSELY based upon Mika Waltari's well researched novel  which centers around the Egyptian physician Sinhue's adventures at the court of Akhnaton as well as his travels throughout Canaan  Minoan Crete and Africa. Unfortunately  due to the moral strictures of the time  much of Sinhue's story (which is rife with romantic and sexual exploits) remains on the cutting room floor and instead  the audience is treated to reels and reels of Victor Mature's wooden acting. Even Gene Tierney  a leading lady staple of the time  can not manage to look nor act her best in this flick and gives a rather somnambulistic performance which can only be justified by the fact that the actress was having some serious psychiatric problems at the time. There is a great deal of rhetoric and theological machinations over the idea of monotheism vs. polytheism  but Michael Wilding is so tiring as the revolutionary Akhnaton  that one is surely cheering for someone to off him and restore the old religion before the second reel. My advice: buy the book from E-Bay  rent something more entertaining like Solomon and Sheba and then call it a night!,negative
I am surprised that so many comments about this film are positive. Having read the book several times (and all the other historical novels by Mika Waltari) there is no way to say much good in this film. If I forget the origins of the story I might consider it a reasonably good epic. Of course to bring such a brick of a book to the big screen is a task not to be envied  but it could be done with class. I can't understand why even the name of Nefernefernefer had to be shortened to just Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov as Kaptah and Marlon Brando probably would have made a better Sinuhe but the overall attitude is too Hollywood to ever make justice to the book. Mind you Mika Waltari left the Premier of this film in the middle of the showing. That's how much he liked it.,negative
The CinemaScope color cinematography of Leon Shamroy is quite remarkable here including his use of colored filters for<br /><br />various scenes. The Alfred Newmann Score has to be the most sensual and seductive score Hollywood ever produced. It's a shame it is no longer available on CD. The actors  however  never rise to the occasion. The accents are so varied  from the subdued British of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature that it seems a true hodgepodge with no central vision. Tommy Rettig is jarringly American. Acting styles span the range from zombie-like to stilted. Only Ustinov as a conniving one-eyed servant steals the show - what there is of it to steal. The premise - the story of a young Egyptian doctor  seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the single God  Ra - persecuted by the authorities  has its interesting points. But when the film's plot fades  it is the haunting music and visuals that remain.,negative
I would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. every episode their is always more white women then black one's. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. I would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your show it's like that in a lot of shows always more white's. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show. but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice. you are just a big fony hypocrite.,negative
A really very bad movie  with a very few good moments or qualities.<br /><br />It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair  who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks  I'm not sure. She jumps through a window and wakes up  and we see she is very pregnant. The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie.<br /><br />She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend (you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff...). He's taking photographs  and she's translating an esoteric German book about witches  I think.<br /><br />Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it  and a real estate agent  and a woman I thought was their daughter. Evidently she was an architect  and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple's children. I guess they all traveled to the island together  but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately).<br /><br />The hotel seems neat  certainly from the exteriors  but it isn't used to any great effect. An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes  which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder.<br /><br />People start getting killed  either in their dreams  or sucked into hell or something. Some of these gore scenes are OK  but not enough to recommend the movie. Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover  the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut. Much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots  since we're not seeing anything ourselves. The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone. He looked particularly nasty. There's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed. I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her  they would do something original with her role  and let her leave Exorcist behind her (except for the yearly horror conventions).<br /><br />In the weird  largely Italian  tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to  this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2. That is  it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse  La (1988) - it's not (that's also a better movie than this one). La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead II (1987) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 (and much better than those). There's also a Casa 5  La (1990) AKA House 5  which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House: House (1986) House II: The Second Story (1987)  The Horror Show (1989) AKA House III  and House IV (1992). How's The Horror Show fit in there? It doesn't really  it claimed to be a sequel  thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) confusion. Oddly  The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House  and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2. Does your head hurt yet?,negative
In watching this off and on for a few seasons  two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.<br /><br />I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of this reality show competition. No other famous model thought of this  and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Women shouldn't watch this  teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject.<br /><br />Many women try out for slots to compete for Americas Next Top Model. They live together  cat fight together  cry together  get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim  You will see me again. Heck  I'm trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win  actually.<br /><br />This is the dream of some girls  and good for them. In watching this I hope the other girls that see this and run like Hades the other way - like to college.<br /><br />I just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group. That even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks. The full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose - so of course that would make them look even fatter - a ploy fashionatas use all the time. Bad  bad  Tyra and crew.<br /><br />But to be fair  Americas Next Top Model is not about full figured models  it's about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the sorry lot of judges  photographers  associations. Hence Tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get. But then again  that IS the one thing I like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldn't have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors. But after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program.,negative
Tyra Banks needs to teach these girls that it's not all about being beautiful on the outside. The inside counts for something too. A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently  Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look. Tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl out. Instead  the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There's a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD and Top Model only has 1 season on DVD. It's called taste. Top Model seriously needs a lot of revamping an some more humanity.,negative
This is by far the most vapid  idiotic  insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air  and this is coming from someone who remembers San Pedro Beach Bums.<br /><br />My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a walk. The end result was straight out of Monty Python's Ministry of Silly Walks sketch. I couldn't laugh hard enough.<br /><br />And then there's the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the...). She has to be the most annoying self-important woman on TV since Rosie O'Donnell left The View. As if modeling was doing great things for mankind. Please. I've never found her attractive  and I don't find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.<br /><br />Someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.,negative
I was wondering what possessed the organizers of the Victoria Film Festival to include this film in their program. I guess they must have agreed with the others who have reviewed this film. I  on the other hand  consider it the worst film I have ever seen. It starts with a bad script  full of holes  and dialog so unlikely it's embarrassing. Ideas are introduced  then dropped with no development. The acting left me totally cold and uninvolved. The set decoration was appropriate for the time  but a decorator's nightmare. The only way the characters could love this house is if their previous homes had been ghastly. The attic looked as if the items had been thrown in for the scene with no attempt to create the look of a real attic that has been filling with junk over the years. The photography was leaden and lacking in variety. Save your money for something worthwhile.,negative
Tamara Anderson and her family are moving once again  as her itinerant painter father chases his next landscape. Fifteen years old  she is in her rebellious stage. Already angry at her father for their frequent relocations  her anger is exacerbated when her mother is suddenly confined to a sanatorium for tuberculosis. Her mother's absence causes Tamara to lash out at her father and seek comfort in religion  the boy next door  Rusty  as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who used to live in her rented house.<br /><br />The story is modest to a fault. It's oddly paced  and even during its emotional scenes there isn't any tension. The actors portraying the parents are fine. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as the sick mother  and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as the guilt-ridden mother of the dead teenager. But Katie Boland  as Tamara  is too amateurish to carry the movie. The dialog is very natural and Boland can't quite pull it off. She has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there were too many times when she came off awkward. One can see her thinking 'ok this is what my line is and this is the face i'm supposed to make' rather than actually reacting to the other actors. She's not the only one  Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park as his sister Brenda also suffer from stilted delivery but at least they're in fewer scenes.<br /><br />If done right  the screenplay could have made her an affecting movie. And it has it moments but much of it is bogged down with an amateurish lead performance and flat directing.,negative
The director seems like a good  solid man. His parents struggle with the same issues we all cope with. They strayed from each other. They loved each other. They misunderstood each other. And the poor audience has to sit through ninety minutes of what is possibly the trials and tribulations of one of the most boring families ever to come out of Long Island.<br /><br />There are few interesting choices in this documentary--the music is banal  the filming uninspired  and the story is the same story that has played out on every Birch Street in every town in America. I don't mean to sound too harsh--seldom has a sweeter  more well-intentioned documentary been made. The director is the kind of man with whom you'd want to be friends. You just wish he had struggled as much presenting the material as his parents did keeping their marriage alive.,negative
"Witchy Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted  disgusting ways. I thought I'd seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire. Hildy is quite the prankster too: she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut...then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire! Witchery made me sick. It made my eyes hurt. I was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever-ever-ever made by otherwise competent people...until the finale. I have to admit I loved the ending. It involves a boy and his toy tape-recorder cornered by Linda Blair looking fantastically possessed. The scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie's over  but you know that old saying: If you've got a great ending, people will forgive you for just about anything!",negative
After seeing the movie  I feel the father and the mother are both reasonable person  although not perfect at all. On the contrary  I don't like the author  and his two sisters.<br /><br />Is a person's journal an accurate portrait of herself? No. Most of time people only write problems in her journal because she want to solve the problem. So a journal is always a more negative side of a person. In this movie  the author judge his mother's life by her journal. Not a wise choice.<br /><br />The author's elder sister is so ugly  external and internal. First  she said her father's second marriage is not fair for her mother. Then  she said she doesn't love her mother. So  she don't love both father and mother. I doubt she love anybody in the world. Her face is so ugly  just a reflection of her heart. Through out the movie  I feel the author and his sisters are lack of love and respect to their parents. However  I feel the father are mother are very loving to their children  even the author try to portrait them as cold  deceitful person.,negative
Excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal. It is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because I try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing. In the case of Full Ride  the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was too busy (during first and only viewing) alternating between laughter and nausea.<br /><br />Fortunately for most individual members of the cast  pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak  the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least well matched physically  finding common ground in looking far too old for the credible age of their characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately the script requires especially intense and convincing performances to portray their characters which just exposes Smith and Monroe's staggering lack of talent. On the positive side  they know enough to not look directly into the camera and they do not stutter.<br /><br />Better to have used a less attractive pair who could physically pass for the proper age. The basic story is not particularly original  just another variation on An Officer and a Gentleman  but it would have provided a nice showcase for a talented pair of teenage actors.<br /><br />Then again  what do I know? I'm just a child.,negative
This is movie is really bad. I like to flip on the TV while napping and this movie looked like it would be something good to sleep through  and boy was I wrong. My body literally woke me up from sleeping and said Hey... this movie is awful... you gotta watch it. I love bad movies with bad actors and stupid plots. Something about unintentional comedy gets me going. This movie is impressively crappy. I really don't know how to properly express it aside from recommending you watch it just to see how bad it is. I mean  seriously  you should watch it with people. I was making the best jokes outloud during this movie and no one was there to hear them.<br /><br />Worse than Swimfan. It's that bad.,negative
Last fall (of 2001)  I took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie (Mark Hoeger). His vast knowledge of filmmaking  his ability to dissect any scene of a film  and his winning of an Academy Award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director. When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called Full Ride and was in the post-production stages  my interest was piqued. However  that would be the last I would ever hear of that film project. Until last week...<br /><br />Last week  I saw in a TV listing that Full Ride was going to be showing on the WB network. This immediately raised a red flag  as I can't help but associate WB with teensploitation shows such as Dawson's Creek  Charmed  etc. PLUS  the fact that Full Ride was going to be released straight to TV wasn't too flattering in itself. But  nevertheless  I set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher's creation.<br /><br />After two hours passed and the end credits began to roll  I thought long and hard about what I had just seen. What I had just seen was a typical WB-quality show stretched out to the length of two hours. In fact  it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the WB network. Critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical WB show.<br /><br />Where to begin? The characters are shallow  the story is cliche in every sense of the word  the scenes are completely contrived  and the character development is forced and unbelievable. This movie just screams `unoriginal.'<br /><br />The main character  Matt Sabo  is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks (literally) who plays solid high school football as a fullback  but then fizzles off into a life of crime. He is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail. Obviously  without much of a choice  he agrees to play football with an all-star football team  but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.<br /><br />Then comes the love interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest? She comes in the form of Amy Lear (played by the beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a likable character  as opposed to the ever-so-abrasive Matt Sabo  so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first. But  of course  the inevitable comes to pass. She falls for him  changes his attitude towards everything  and all seems good and happy. But now it's time for conflict!<br /><br />Earlier in the movie  Amy makes it clear to Matt that she doesn't want to score with him  because it would be `shameful' to her and her mother. This is much to Matt's dismay  and his football buddies (yes  they eventually warm up to him) who bet him he wouldn't get any. But  of course  Matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he's not all about the nookie. Here's where the exciting plot thickens. If you don't want me to ruin this surprise  then skip ahead.<br /><br />[BEGIN SPOILER]<br /><br />Matt finds out from some local guys that apparently Amy Lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the All-Star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria (which is baffling in the first place) and make it to the big city. Suddenly realizing he's been used and that his love was a sham  Matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before `the big game.' Amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time  but he's too hot-headed to buy it. So what will Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all-round jerk? I won't ruin the super-ultra-surprising ending for you.<br /><br />[END SPOILER]<br /><br />So  if I somehow got you pumped up for this movie  please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of `Varsity Blues' or `Summer Catch.' And that's not saying much. There's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about. So what do you have left? Not a whole lot.<br /><br />What I most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture Hoeger painted of Nebraska through this film. It seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in the small towns  but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow. The characters' high hopes for making in `the big city' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated  and it only further cements the stereotype of Nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities. I am unsure of whether or not Hoeger's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight  but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light  he should have taken a note or two from Alexander Payne. While Payne simply chooses to use Nebraska as a backdrop for his films  Hoeger integrates it into the plot of Full Ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he's shooting  that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider. If Hoeger actually lived here  you'd think he'd know better than that.<br /><br />All in all  I am completely disappointed in Hoeger's first big film  and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought-provoking.,negative
If this movie were in production today it would probably have the christian right-wingers screaming 'child porn'. It is far from a great film  in fact it is rather pedestrian. However  if you have an imagination and a fond remembrance of youth and first love I recommend it.,negative
I've got as much testosterone as the next bloke  and Raquel Welch at her finest is certainly worth a look; but the fact is that a cardboard cut-out could act better  and an hour and half of Ms. W showing off her considerable assets does not a movie make.<br /><br />Considering the cast  it's surprising that it's as bad as it is. I've never been a big fan of Wagner  and his tough guy Harry is about as convincing as a 9-dollar bill. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica  both of whom I usually enjoy  seem to be sleeping through their lines; and as for Edward G...well  I can only assume he was there for the paycheck.<br /><br />This film is a mess: from non-existent plot  through stop-start action and unfunny script to puerile slapstick and annoying 60's 'caper' music. If it weren't for Miss Welch  I'd have given it a 0.<br /><br />That said  she is a treat to the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in 'Bedazzled' - and for that reason alone I gave it a 3.,negative
Following his role in the fine caper SEVEN THIEVES (1960) – which I’ve watched several years back – Edward G. Robinson seemed to be stuck playing elderly criminal mastermind types (apart from the odd juicy role as in THE CINCINNATI KID [1965]). I’d previously watched the pretty good “Euro-Cult” effort GRAND SLAM (1967) and  apart from this  I’ve yet two more similar titles from Italy to check – one of which was directed by future goremeister Lucio Fulci! Anyway  this is the kind of international production – featuring American and Italian actors and a British director – which was prevalent during the 1960s; it’s harmless and easy-going in itself but hardly memorable and definitely overlong – especially since to procure finance for the heavy-duty equipment required for the heist (such as an army tank and an airplane!)  the gang involved have to pull a variety of minor thefts first.<br /><br />The gang  of course  is an incompetent lot led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (Raquel Welch) – the others are a ‘pacifist’ black man  a perennially hungry Italian and a diminutive Englishman. They try to induce an ex-gangster (Vittorio De Sica) to turn over his fortune to them  except he’s destitute…but  under the auspices of “Professor” Robinson  he proposes instead a caper of 5 million dollars’ worth of platinum! Needless to say  the gang members don’t trust one another (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sica so as to get the name of their fence in Morocco – where they are to retreat after the robbery)  or else bungle the job (commissioned to hold up a restaurant  the Italian can’t resist sitting at table and order a multi-course meal for himself!). Amusingly  in the face of similar failures  De Sica tries to show them how they used to do it in the old days – however  ostensibly holding up a petrol station  it transpires that the owner is a nephew of his and he merely asked to borrow some cash! <br /><br />The central heist sequence is typically elaborate: while the gang  including Welch  ‘take’ the train transporting the platinum  Wagner kidnaps pilot Victor Spinetti and his airplane. When the job is done  he fully intends to double-cross De Sica – but neither his partners nor Welch herself are willing to go along with this  so he’s forced to relent. Coming from the time when crime didn’t pay  the gang contrives to lose all their stash in mid-air when the plane’s bomb-bay doors are accidentally opened…,negative
This movie is a cinematic collage of gangster clichés. The writing is grade z and the plot and story are constructed without care or logic. It a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters (think of Bugs Bunny cartoons) and silly supporting characters (the lady doctor and the writer). There are much better Bogart films out there. In fact  Bogart looks like he slept through this performance. He puts very little effort into this character. I think the directorial advice he received was something like He's a bad guy. Act bad. This guy is the era's equivalent of Darth Vader; obvious  evil and the anti-hero. Don't waste your time with this one.,negative
Although Humphrey Bogart got star billing in King Of The Underworld  I'm willing to bet he didn't thank Jack Warner for it. In fact this film was one hollow crown.<br /><br />King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of the Paul Muni film  Dr. Socrates  but given Humphrey Bogart was in the cast  the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer along in the person of James Stephenson.<br /><br />Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of Bogart's henchmen. Bogey's a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge $500.00 and there's more where that came from if he plays his cards right. Eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income. <br /><br />But when he's killed in a raid on the gang's hideout  Francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the American Medical Association no matter how much she protests her innocence. It's no good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety.<br /><br />Of course the notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant Leslie Howard like writer in Stephenson all meet up with her again. But Kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least.<br /><br />Bogart's character was ridiculous  no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts. He's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs. He's concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer Stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let's Kay Francis completely outsmart him  hard to believe he was king of anything.<br /><br />Definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars.,negative
This was the worst Wrestlemania in history. The only good matches were Ricky Steamboat vs. Hercules Hernandez  and the tag title match between the British Bulldogs and the Dream Team (this one bordered on classic). Everything else was either poor or awful. The idea of having three host cities was unnecessary  confusing and messed up the fluidity of the show. The celebrity guests were terrible on commentary  especially Susan Saint James.<br /><br />If you're interested in the mid 80's WWF  you're better renting or buying Wrestlemania 3  or just about any other PPV for that matter.,negative
*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*<br /><br />I'll only say what hasn't already been said here (and I'll continue this for the rest of my WWF/WWE comments).<br /><br />If you're going to have a Women's title match  at least make it interesting  rather than just a squash to put over the current champion. I guess Moolah couldn't handle an intense match but they wanted to have the legend in a WrestleMania.<br /><br />I thought the Killer Bees were wasted in WrestleManias  especially here. I became a fan in 1989  about a year after the B. Brian Blair was gone and Jim Brunzell became a canvas back. So I didn't realize for a while that they were a top tag team  even top contenders.<br /><br />But I loved seeing Bill Fralic in the battle royal. He really came into his own here  creating a cocky heel character in a pre-match interview and even making an elimination in the battle royal. Besides Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene  he is the only professional athlete from my generation with any respect for wrestling (anyone remember Dennis Rodman?). And what was with the Hart Foundation's ridiculous green tights?,negative
Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania|thank god| to be held at three different locations  and While it was an interesting idea  it didn't really work. There are only really two matches that really struck out  with the rest being decent  or most of them  pretty terrible. There are some entertaining celebrity's on hand  like Susan Saint James  Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby  but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. The British Bulldgos Vs The Dream Team match  is worth the price of admission itself  but you can honestly see that anywhere.<br /><br />Matches.<br /><br />Nassau Coliseum.<br /><br />Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco/W Mr.Fuji. For the time it had  and despite the crappy finish  this was surprisingly bearable stuff  with the crowd being really into it. Crowd chants Bullsh*t at the end. That being said it did nothing for either's career. Match ends in a double count out with them fighting outside the ring<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />Intercontinental Championship Match. Randy Savage|C| Vs George The Animal Steele. Not that great wrestling wise  but heavily entertaining due to the antics involved  and some great comedy from Steele  besides savage can wrestle a potato and make it look interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes  for leverage.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Jake The Snake Roberts Vs George Wells. For a throwaway match  this was better than it should have been  but it's too short to make any impact what so ever. Roberts wins with the DDT  pulling out the snake afterwords  which disgusts Saint James.<br /><br />1 1/2 /5<br /><br />Boxing Match. Mr.T/W The Hati Kid&Joe Frazier Vs Roddy Piper/W Lou Duva&Bob Orton. A huge failure in my opinion. I was bored senseless throughout this  and while it may have been a marketing success  it certainly didn't succeed at entertaining me. Lot of Rowdy chants are noticeable as well. T wins by DQ  when Piper slams T.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />Rosemont Horizon<br /><br />Women's Title match. Fabulous Moolah|C| Vs Velvet Mcintyre. Ends too quickly  before it even gets a chance to start  making a record for quick pin fall  as far as Woman's matches are concerned. Moolah wins when she takes advantage of Velvet's missed splash from the top rope<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />Corporal Kirchner Vs Nikolai Volkoff/W Classy Freddie Blassie. Big pop for the Corporal. Stupid match up  with boring offense from both involved  while being much too short to matter. Corporal wins when he whacks Volkoff with Blassie's cane.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre get the biggest pops. This is pretty entertaining stuff  despite all the NFL talent involved. It's also noteworthy for Bret Hart's 1st ever Wrestlemania appearance. Andre wins when he chucks The Hart Foundation out.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Tag Team Titles. British Bulldogs/W Lou Albano&Ozzy Osbourne Vs The Dream Team/W Johnny Valiant|C|. Absolutely tremendous match  that is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time. You won't have time to catch your breath  with all the maneuvers on hand  and the excellent in ring psychology. This is pure wrestling at it's finest  you cannot call yourself a Wrestling fan  if you dislike this match. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid collide's heads with Valentine<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena<br /><br />Ricky Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez. Pretty decent match up here  with both men putting on solid performances. Hercules is a nasty brute  with above average skills  and it contrasted well with Steamboat's high-flying style. Steamboat wins with a high-flying cross body off the top rope.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer. Terrible match  with annoying comedy involved. The fans love Uncle Elmer  but I do not. Adonis wins with a top rope maneuver.<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />The Funk Brothers Vs Tito Santana&JYD. Pretty solid match here  with a lot of memorable bumps taken from Terry Funk|the one through the table was something else for that time|. I would have to rate this as my 2nd favorite. Funks win with help from Jimmy Hart's megaphone.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan|C| Vs King Kong Bundy. Decent pop for Hogan. One of the most over-hyped matches in Wrestlemania history. Hogan can't wrestle worth a lick  and Bundy is not that great himself. The violence was brutal for the time  but Hogan's superhero act is kind of annoying  and there are too many boring moments. Hogan wins when he escapes before Bundy.<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />Bottom line. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. Die hard wrestling fans should see this once  but you really don't have too. There isn't enough here  to satisfy a true wrestling fan. Vince blew it on this one. Don't be fooled by the hype of the main event  it really is a boring affair  like most of the card. Not recommended  and ranks as one of the worst Wrestlemania's  outside of the brilliant tag title match.<br /><br />4/10,negative
Why do the powers that be continue to cast Jennifer Lopez in unbelievable roles? She was excellent in Selena  and pretty good in Money Train  which both cast her in roles where she could basically be herself. However  roles like this just draw the line. I could never see Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for that unremarkable performance)  but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break!<br /><br />Basically  Lopez plays the aforementioned psychotherapist  who is involved in virtual reality experiments in which she enters the minds of her patients in order to help them sort out their issues. When she enters the mind of a comatose serial killer to help save one of his victims  she breaks all the rules to try and crack the insanity of his inner mind.<br /><br />Lopez's acting here is typically below average. I can't get over that high-pitched squeak of a voice she has. She's no Julia Roberts  but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field. Well  she's not even in the same stadium. Sure  she is a very sexy lady; however  that isn't going to carry a film  and it certainly doesn't carry this one. With anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent  especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character.<br /><br />Having said all that  this film is visually stunning. The colors are fabulous  and the story line isn't half bad in a B-movie kind of way. The audio here is superb as well. This movie gains some points for the fairly original storyline  and major points for how it looks and sounds. Unfortunately  the acting and poor casting bring it down a few notches.<br /><br />My Rating: 6/10,negative
Witchery might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but  luckily enough  it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects  an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. Honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense  but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo  sewn-shut lips  upside down crucifixions  vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. They're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. Anyway  the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of The Evil Dead. The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. There's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.,negative
I love exotic science fiction/fantasy movies but this one was very unpleasant to watch. Suggestions and images of child abuse  mutilated bodies (live or dead)  other gruesome scenes  plot holes  boring acting made this a regretable experience  The basic idea of entering another person's mind is not even new to the movies or TV (An Outer Limits episode was better at exploring this idea). i gave it 4/10 since some special effects were nice.,negative
If you like to watch movies because they are pretty  you should be okay with this one. If you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy  then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie  skip it. At the end of the movie i still didn't know why Stargher killed the women the way he did. When you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from. In Dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasn't the best  but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained. They also hinted at a dark background for Vaughn's character but didn't explain  didn't really say why Lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited for this task than the rest of the people they interviewed  didn't give much of an explanation for the little kid's problem  etc. If the rest of the story is compelling  I don't care about details like how Stargher afforded all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers or why the FBI wasn't checking to see if he owned any other property or had access to out of the way places while they were waiting to see if the whole entering the killer's mind thing would work  but I do like to have a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex manner.,negative
As I said the idea itself was great and it had plenty potential. I was truly sad of discovering that this was another typical American mass movie: We are in this for the money... If only the producers had had more time to actually MAKE the movie. This one was not finished when they let it out...,negative
I really enjoy this genre but The Cell was one of the worst movies I've ever been unfortunate enough to watch. While about 25 percent of my audience wandered in and out of the theater during the viewing (or left entirely) I was dumb enough to stick it out. The main problems with this story (there were too many to list all) is that with this type of film you have to do two things... one  provide fear of the killer (being that they catch him twenty minutes into the film that's gone) and you must give the victim whose life is at stake (the girl in the tank) enough character development that you actually care whether they get to her in time or not. Not only did I lose track of the girl  I was given such little insight into her that she was only a blurry face and when I did remember she was part of the story I really didn't care what happened to her. While the visuals were interesting in an LSD flashback sort of way  they often times made no sense and this should be a lesson that visuals can't make up for lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example) Finally  does anyone know or care what was up with the women kneeling in that field and staring at the sky? Ridiculous.,negative
I'm in a film class and i know that i don't know everything about film but truthfully this is one of the worst  stupidest  retarded and waste time  movies that i have ever seen and i saw NAPOLEAN DINAMITE. they are both equally terrible. Conrack is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the film its not really a heart warming story and Pat Conroy overcomes nothing! I'm not saying there should be fighting and crap blowing up but it would liven up this more than bland film. the kids they fond to act in this film may have been the real kids from yammacraux island they sounded stupid and couldn't act as as far as i am concerned this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idEa fOr a movie I don't know why this movie was even made  deviantly top five worst movies of all time.,negative
Witchcraft/Witchery/La Casa 4/ and whatever else you wish to call it. How about..Crud.<br /><br />A gathering of people at a Massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel  torturous methods. Photographer Gary(David Hasselhoff)is taking pictures for Linda(Catherine Hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble EE-YOR of the Winnie the Poo cartoon)  a virgin studying witchcraft  on the island resort without permission. Rose Brooks(Annie Ross  portraying an incredibly rude bitch)is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and  along with husband Freddie(Robert Champagne  who is always ogling other women much younger than him)  pregnant daughter Jane(Linda Blair)and grandson Tommy(Michael Manchester  who just looks bored throughout  probably wanting to watch Sesame Street instead of starring in this rubbish)  go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by Realtor Tony Giordano's son Jerry(Rick Farnsworth)  obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet. Along with these folks is architect Leslie(Leslie Cumming  whose character is a nympho)who might help Rose re-design the resort. The boat's captain is killed by The Lady in Black(Hildegard Knef  wearing her make-up and lip-stick extra thick)and a storm is brewing. The boat drives off by itself(..guided by the invisible power of The Lady in Black  I guess)with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort  which is in dire need of repairs. Most of the victims  before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension(..perhaps a type of hell or something)where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage. One victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney  roasted as the others light the fireplace. One poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck. One fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge(..and bleed) and neck's blood vessels burst squirting in Hasselhoff's face! One fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame. Blair's pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman's voice. One is raped by this demonic man with a diseased mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering. The film  despite it's excesses  is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair  who deserve better than this. Almost unbearable at times  building little-to-no suspense. Clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable. Sure some gore is okay  but most of the film shows victims after they've been run through the ringer. We do get a chance to see pregnant women(..who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs) jumping out three story windows. Oh  and The Lady in Black's reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see. Tommy has a little Sesame Street recorder which tapes The Lady in Black's mumbo jumbo chants  obviously used for later. For some reason  The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy. He's not at all scared of her  for Tommy's just too bored to show any expression on his face  much less fear. Need I say more? This one's a real stinker. Ugh.,negative
This is one of the worst films i've ever seen  don't watch it even if your life depends on it.<br /><br />This Laurel and Hardy film is when they inherit an island  become shipwrecked and are set to be hung. An incredibly boring film that is no where near funny.<br /><br />This was the last Laurel and Hardy film and what a very low note to end such a superb career. The 40's films weren't great  this film was made in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy  remember them in their prime  the 1930's. The short talking films are better than the feature length films  my favourite is Me and My Pal. Another reason this film is awful is because it's dubbed. The actor opens there mouth and the words come out three days later. Absoulutley crap  but let's end on a high note  Laurel and Hardy have been  in my opinion  the best double act ever.,negative
I could almost wish this movie had not been made. Stan Laurel was dying  and it shows in his face  even more angular and gaunt than usual. A poor script  and inept supporting cast.,negative
I never want to see this movie again!<br /><br />Not only is it dreadfully bad  but I can't stand seeing my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick.<br /><br />Mostly I can't stand watching this terrible movie!<br /><br />Frankly  there is no reason to watch this awful film. The plot is just plain stupid. The actors that surround Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really really bad and Laurel and Hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films! <br /><br />I warn you don't watch it  the images will haunt you for a long while to come!,negative
First  let me start by saying that I am a Laurel and Hardy buff. I have read every book printed about them  and have seen all of their available films more than once. I even took a chance once  and called Stan on the telephone. He was very kind  and spoke with me for over ten minutes. I followed with a letter  and he wrote me a letter back. I still have that letter.<br /><br />This film has some fine comedy moments  but Stan and Ollie are not up to their usual form. Stan was gravely ill during the production and looked worse than he did ten years later. In my opinion  any Laurel and Hardy film is worth seeing.<br /><br />But the Ultimate opinion of this film comes from the great Stan Laurel himself. To quote him  This film should never have been made.,negative
"Atoll K aka Utopia is one of Hollywood's saddest swan songs. Filmed in France  The Land That Loves Lewis (Jerry) in 1950 and released the following year after a five-year layoff  the boys are in truly terrible shape physically. However  they aren't in nearly as bad a shape as the script.<br /><br />This movie is one of the un-funniest comedies ever filmed.<br /><br />It's painful to see this legendary team  the funniest duo in the history of motion pictures  the twosome that made The Devil's Brother (1933)  The Music Box, (1932) Pack Up Your Troubles (also 1932)  Babes In Toyland (1934)  Bonnie Scotland (1935)  Flying Deuces (1939) and so many more gut-wrenching  laugh-til-you-choke classic comedies  in a film such as this.<br /><br />But fighters and ballplayers do it all the time. They stay in the game one season or one fight too many. In this case  while is morbidly fascinating to see Laurel & Hardy at this late stage in their legendary careers  they  too  stuck around for one too many.",negative
When the movie begins  it's obvious just how old and sick the boys are. Although Oliver Hardy is enormous  it is Stanley that looks like death warmed over. Apparently  he was deathly ill during production and had obviously lost a lot of weight. Although he would eventually recover and live another decade and a half  here he looks like a dying man. Additionally  as I watched the film I was shocked how many pratfalls Stan took--I half expected his to drop dead from the exertion. I really can't understand WHY they came out of retirement considering their health--especially when the story and production values are as poor as they are with this film. <br /><br />Stanley inherits an island and a boat. He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine  a stateless man  is literally dropped into their boat and they begin their voyage to find the island. Along the way  they discover that Giovanni has stowed away  but despite this the four men become friends and land on a different island. It seems like paradise and they are all very happy. A bit later  a pretty young lady joins them and everything looks grand.<br /><br />Unfortunately  uranium is discovered on the island and the place becomes flooded with riffraff. Eventually  the mob decides to hang the four men and take over--at which point the island sinks back into the sea and the men are spared.<br /><br />I will give the film some credit for being original and for being interesting. However  one thing it is not is FUNNY--and that is unforgivable for a Laurel and Hardy flick. While not a bad film  it certainly isn't a good one. A sad end to their brilliant careers.<br /><br />All the actors  except for the duo  are dubbed into English  as the movie was made in France. While it may not be the very worst film they made (this would be THE BIG NOISE)  it sure is close!! Watching this film is painful and like watching people clean up after a severe accident.,negative
This movie was difficult for me to watch. Stan looked very old and ill compared to what I remembered  and Ollie was heavier than I ever recall in another film. Most difficult though were gaps in the script/production where I found myself wondering  How did they get from here to there??? It took nearly half the film before I could deal with the dubbing of non-American actors -- that was also a distraction.<br /><br />Although I miss great actors such as Laurel and Hardy -- will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era??? -- this film helps me understand why actors sometimes bow out in their prime.,negative
I just watched Atoll K-Laurel and Hardy's last movie together and known here in the states as Utopia-on Internet Archive expecting to see some extra footage since the IA version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. Turns out that it's basically the same version I previously watched on the bargain basement VHS tape from Goodtimes Home Video that ran an hour and 23 minutes (with the exception of no product placement of the Welch's Grape Juice label being inserted when a bottle was shown) with the rest of the running time devoted to dark blank space. While Stan does look like he might be dying anytime soon  he still performs fine physical comedy with Ollie during much of the first 45 minutes or so. Then the plot of taking a yacht with a stowaway and a man with no country aboard-not to mention a charming female French singer also coming to inhabit an uncharted island they all end up on-takes over with eventual complications that pretty much bogs the comedy down and never really recovers despite the familiar ending of Ollie saying for the last time to Stan  Here's another nice mess you've gotten me into! before Stan cries uncontrollably before the fade out. In other words  if you're a die-hard Laurel and Hardy fan  this movie is recommended for you to see at least once. Anyone else wanting to get familiar with this classic comedy team should seek their earlier work they did for Hal Roach from the '20s up through 1940 when they completed their final Roach film  Saps at Sea. Come to think of it  even some of the L & H Fox flicks (have yet to see the two they made for M-G-M) from the '40s are better than this one...Update-8/29/09: Just watched some missing scenes that appeared in the Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and has a conversation with the Captain. In another  that Captain's wife pulls a gun on Cherie. In one more  Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. Stan is dubbed in high pitch here!,negative
Oh  why did it have to end like this? Laurel and Hardy's last film  from the crudely cranked-up Cuckoo theme (with erroneous credit to Hal Roach) to the closing Nice mess/I couldn't help it schtick  this is the duo as a grotesque parody of themselves. In between  their relationship is now solely constructed of uncertain acting  asinine dialogue and half-hearted slapstick. People slate King of New York  but Chaplin's final bow-out was nowhere near as undignified as this.<br /><br />What really hurts to someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the appearance of the two comedians. The video cover I'm holding shows them at their prime  all boyish smiles and glowing skin  with a blurb on the back that reads The photograph on this sleeve is for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily reflect the content of the film. Necessarily? It doesn't even come close. The actual film sees them at least fifteen years older than the photographs that adorn the sleeve  with Ollie distressingly overweight. This is not humorously  or comically  fat  as he would normally appear  but ill looking and on the verge of obesity. He would be dead seven years after this film was made  after a series of strokes. Stan  meanwhile  suffering a prostrate problem and dysentery  looks ghoulish as his weight has plummeted drastically. Every time something bad happens to him  such as getting squashed between a lifeboat and a table  you fear for his life. Even Ollie giving him a traditional slap makes you terrified he could be killed. He would last for another fifteen years after the completion of this film  eventually passing away from a heart attack in 1965. It's upsetting to think of such cherished performers growing old and dying painful deaths. And it's distressing watching their deterioration  both in health  and in performance  on screen. When I  and  I'm sure  almost everyone else  likes to think of Laurel and Hardy  I think of Way Out West  Busy Bodies or Our Relations. Seeing them in such physical ill health and performing dire routines at the dog-end of their career is a blight on my happy memories of them.<br /><br />The warning signs are clear right from the opening credits  which list not only four writers  but also someone to come up with the concept  and a credit for gags. So if Monty Collins was writing the gags  then what were the other four writing? And in that case  why was Monty Collins paid a fee  given that there's no evidence of a single gag in the whole film? Over 40% of the movie is spent travelling to the eponymous island  during which we experience some of the most painfully unfunny scenes the boys were ever involved in. When I saw the bat scene I wanted to curl up and die  so great was its childish ineptitude. Yet what kills the film stone dead is that all of the support cast are dubbed  unable to speak English. Not only does this make the film disjointed  but also it severely depletes Stan and Ollie's reactions to their co-stars. Flatly directed with appalling film stock and absolutely atrocious editing  this totally belies the rumoured $2 million that was spent on it. Frankly  it looks terrible  and while a DVD release might clean up the picture  the sound and image quality is vastly inferior to any of their Hal Roach work.<br /><br />Stan and Ollie's friends  Giovani and Antoine are charisma-free bores who stand out greatly against Laurel and Hardy's outdated repertoire. This is another major problem with the film  in that none of the supporting characters are funny  or keyed in to the boys' innocent mentality. The dubbed harshness shown to L & H (you - the fat one) makes them stand out as isolated social misfits  rather than loveable sub-anarchists. There is evidence of some darker political satire - though Duck Soup this ain't - and the concept of an island with no rules is an interesting topic. Perhaps more relevant now than it ever was  a film that looks at the problems of immigration and the American constitution suddenly becomes most topical in 2003. Sadly  however  beyond an amusing scene where Stan is elected the people  this doesn't really go anywhere. And this somewhat black humour does have its harsh edges - or is a Laurel and Hardy movie where rape is directly implied and Stan threatens a man with a bottle  only to accidentally glass someone in the face  your idea of a good time? After all the years of Stan and Ollie sharing a bed  we also get a definite reference  with Stan accidentally kissing him - Ollie wipes off the kiss in disgust. Also worrying is the implication that Stan and Ollie's illegal immigrant friend  Antoine  ends his life being eaten by a lion. Mind you  I never thought I'd see a Laurel and Hardy movie where they were due to be hanged  either. The need for the intrusive and unfunny narration is a further pointer to how messy the whole thing is  with the American release (the same version available on video) hacking out 16 minutes in a vain attempt to improve it.<br /><br />Almost completely unwatchable  this horrifically made  relentlessly unfunny movie serves only to tarnish the reputation of Stan and Ollie - avoid at all costs.,negative
OK so it's not great either  but only because of how great Laurel and Hardy have been in the past. If this film received a total overhaul  with picture quality enhanced  add new dubbing to the badly dubbed voices and added a nice unobtrusive background music then this film would truly start to take shape. As it is  it does have it's problems. People do slate it for how old the boys look. Quel surprise! they were in their 60's and had led a 'life'. However  to me  they still came across as having bucketfulls of charm  and while this doesn't even come close to tickling the feet of their classics( I gave it a 4)  it's worth a watch simply because it's them. To think otherwise would be impostorous!!,negative
Released at a time when Duvivier was going again from strength to strength .Black Jack which was sandwiched between the overlooked extraordinary Au Royaume des Cieux and the dazzling stunning Sous Le Ciel de Paris   is a jumble which Duvivier himself hated which is not surprising.There's almost nothing to write about this dud.We can notice that: <br /><br />1.Orson Welles used to admire Duvivier .That may explain why Wellesian actors were featured in Duvivier's movies :Joseph Cotten in Lydia (1941)  and here a totally wasted Agnes Moorehead .It's the first time<br /><br />I have not enjoyed Moorehead's performance!On the other hand Welles borrowed his Desdemona (Suzanne Cloutier) from Duvivier's Au Royaume des Cieux for his Othello.<br /><br />2.In any Duvivier's movie there's one or two worthwhile sequences and this one is no exception: the search in the caves where Duvivier's sense of mystery works wonders (for a short while);then the chase when Dalio gets caught up in the fishnets.Duvivier's touch can be felt in the unhappy end too.<br /><br />As for the rest  as my dear pen pal writer's reign writes it's a black joke.,negative
I find Herzog's documentary work to be very uneven. Fata Morgana  a companion piece of sorts to Lessons of Darkness  lacks not only the harrowing spectacle but mostly the discerning eye of an author. It is by comparison amateur looking  aimless pans left and right across the desert the kind of which you would expect from any German tourist equipped with a handycam  the camera left running from the window of a car picking up all kinds of meaningless images  wire fences  derelict buildings and patches of dirt going through the lens in haphazard order  intercut with shots of sand dunes. At one point Herzog encounters a group of starved cattle rotting away in the sand  yet the image is presented much like you and me would  perhaps worse  the camera peering hand-held from one cattle to the next. For a documentary that attempts to be a visual feast  a hypnotic  surreal excursion in uncharted landscapes  it lacks the visual orchestration and conviction of a disciplined author. It's all over the place  half-hearted and tedious  Mayan creation myths recited in voice-over  then some other text Herzog fancied for literature. It's not until near the end that Fata Morgana jumps alive through a series of bizarre encounters. First with a man and a woman playing music in a room  the man singing in a distorted voice through a mic  both of them apathetic in their task. A man holding up a turtle. A group of old people trying to get out of some holes in the ground. Other than that  this one seems to have very little of substance to offer or visual splendor to offer.,negative
"There are many different versions of this one floating around  so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies  otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing. Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT: EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show  who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release. It's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage  but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. In Italy  it was released as LA CASA 4 (WITCHCRAFT). The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films (retitled) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company (Filmirage)  which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE. To make matters even more confusing  WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2. Except in Germany  where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE: DEMONS 3. OK  I better just shut up now. I'm starting to confuse myself!<br /><br />Regardless of the title  this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort. Some of it is good  some of it isn't. I actually was into this film for the first half or so  but toward the end it became a senseless mess. A large  vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting  as various people get picked off one-by-one by a German- speaking witch (Hildegard Knef). Photographer Gary (David Hasselhoff)  who wants to capture Witch Light, and his virginal writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming)  who is studying witchcraft  are shacking up at the hotel without permission. Along comes real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth)  who's showing off the property to potential buyers Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) Brooks. Also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and very young son Tommy (Michael Manchester)  as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff's wife at the time). Once everyone is inside  their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears  so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the Lady in Black.<br /><br />So what can you expect to find here? Plenty of unpleasantries! One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast. There's also a crucifixion  witches eating a dead baby  a swordfish through the head  someone set on fire  a possession  a Sesame Street tape recorder  the virgin getting raped by some demon  a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. From a technical standpoint  it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography  a decent score and good gore effects. The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. Blair (particularly at the end) and Ross both seem like they're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch. Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days  he's not bad in his role  either.<br /><br />On the down side  despite all the gore  the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing  too. When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed  the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber. And while most of the cast is at least decent  a few of the performances (particularly the actress who plays Hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid) are so bad they're constantly distracting.",negative
"People stranded in a country house during a storm discover that the home was the sight of an unsolved murder years before. During a dinner discussion of the incident, the lights go out and, when they come back on, they discover that one of the guests has been killed. Fearing for their lives, the guests attempt to find out the secrets behind the death before others can occur, according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />There are a couple of clever twists in this murder at the Old Dark House story  with the Play within a Play being its most interesting feature. However  the direction is rather ordinary  which serves to highlight a certain cheapness of production. Like most movies of this type  there is (or  should be) an ensemble of intriguing characters. Herein  only old-time Broadway producer Richard Carle (as Herman Wood) and his fey secretary Johnny Arthur (as Homer Erskine) maintain interest.<br /><br />**** The Ghost Walks (12/1/34) Frank R.

Of all of the post-1985 Perry Mason movies I have seen  this one is my least favorite.<br /><br />I confess I have never liked Diana Muldaur as an actress. She only seems to know how to play one type of character - a hard-bitten career woman with some undefined chip on her shoulder who for that reason is extremely difficult to in any way sympathize with. This one is no exception - it runs true to form.<br /><br />The only thing that saves this movie  in my opinion  is an earnest performance by Scott Baio as the prosecutor - I actually found myself rooting for him to win  and the movie is worth seeing for him alone.,negative
Despite the fact that the plot follows the well-known recipe of who did it  which has characterised all the Perry Mason movies so far  the characters of the present film are not so well-developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood. Of course  in general  the Perry Mason movies are not significant  but  even for their low standards  this one is weak.,negative
This movie was recommended to me by some academics. From their comments  I had some pretty lofty expectations. But this movie was nothing but disappointing. The aim of the director is obvious--to use an interweaving of speeches/poems as a way to argue against the Bush doctrine. But the director fails miserably at this. Also I seriously question the director's choice of main character. It's a bum who is definitely not worthy of being heard. The rise of corporation power  so what? Most importantly  this movie gets a failing score in its persuasive power; it's clearly intended for those who've already formed their opinions. It's true that the movie's aesthetics are quite pleasing. But pretty much everything else in the movie simply sucks.,negative
I have read all of Shakespeare's plays  seen productions of a majority of them and even acted in and directed some. I do not necessarily believe that Shakespeare must be done in the traditional fashion  but I hated this movie.<br /><br />There is nudity that is gratuitous and unnecessary. There is grotesqueness that is far beyond what I believe Shakespeare intended. Some of the dialogue is incomprehensible  and there are those elements  like the singing and dancing that add no meaning to the movie  but replace Shakespeare with the director's self-indulgences.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that I wasted perfectly good money to buy the DVD of this movie.,negative
Blake Edwards' legendary fiasco  begins to seem pointless after just 10 minutes. A combination of The Eagle Has Landed  Star!  Oh! What a Lovely War!  and Edwards' Pink Panther films  Darling Lili never engages the viewer; the aerial sequences  the musical numbers  the romance  the comedy  and the espionage are all ho hum. At what point is the viewer supposed to give a damn? This disaster wavers in tone  never decides what it wants to be  and apparently thinks it's a spoof  but it's pathetically and grindingly square. Old fashioned in the worst sense  audiences understandably stayed away in droves. It's awful. James Garner would have been a vast improvement over Hudson who is just cardboard  and he doesn't connect with Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hudson don't seem to have been let in on the joke and perform with a miscalculated earnestness. Blake Edwards' SOB isn't much more than OK  but it's the only good that ever came out of Darling Lili. The expensive and professional look of much of Darling Lili  only make what it's all lavished on even more difficult to bear. To quote Paramount chief Robert Evans  24 million dollars worth of film and no picture.,negative
This was an interesting adaption of William Shakespeare's last known solo play but in my humble opinion  a terrible one. Jarman tries to change the personalities of the characters for a start. He makes Miranda seem insane after being stuck on the island for so long  Prospero is no different - a mix of madness and self-pity on his part. I could not imagine Shakespeare thinking his characters to be anything like the way Jarman portraits them.<br /><br />Caliban's appearance is maybe the only thing he got right  but then again  I was under the impression that Caliban was a tormented  deformed monster but turns out to be an insane rambling  northerner who is constantly cackling  not as I would have imagined him. Ferdinand makes a brief appearance  naked most the time and quiet.<br /><br />In fact  to the point I stopped watching this awful adaption  their had been so many lines cut from the play. If anything  I think Jarman was trying to re-write Shakespeare and include his own scenes most the time. So much text is cut out in the first part it makes it not a Shakespeare play  but a load of 70's melodramatic  preposterous rubbish.<br /><br />An attempt to interpret this play more realistically in the end  but this play was never a realistic one and it was made nothing like the text displays it to be.,negative
I was loaned this DVD by the director of a film I am working with  in which I play an actor who is playing Prospero. Knowing his own style  I did not expect anything resembling a classical interpretation of the text.<br /><br />What I have found is sometimes striking  sometimes evocative  but often meandering and tedious. Like most experimental music  I find that in films such as this  the building blocks of powerful film-making are crafted  even if they have not found their most useful form in a more coherent format.<br /><br />Thus we have a Caliban who is more a clown than a threat  and who not even Miranda seems terribly afraid of (which is odd  since we know that he has attempted to rape her at least once). A Stefano and Trinculo who are more annoying than funny. An oddly young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and plot through creative editing and highly stylized posturing.<br /><br />Interestingly enough  I do not have an issue with the way in which Ferdanand or Miranda are portrayed. His stunned rapture and her slightly freaky innocence are actually quite appropriate.<br /><br />I do not say that this is a bad film  but an experimental one. One that takes huge risks  but is meant more for students of art and film and not really for anyone with an interest in the Tempest for its own sake.,negative
Derek Jarman has shown us time and time again that dialog is not his strong suit. He is a painter  and paint he does. His films are almost always visually splendid  but about as exciting to watch as paint that is already dry. Watch his movies in fast forward  the really fast setting that you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest  Jarman does very little with the script or the characters  using them as simply a lattice to hang a very long and well-constructed cinematographic frame. He even goes so far as to contradict Shakespeare's original script to achieve these excrucriatingly slow and lifeless scenes. There is none of the romance  magic  trickery  or urgency the script calls for  little spontaneity  and the character of Caliban in particular is reduced to a quivering and insane idiot of sorts  similar to Gaveston in Jarman's Edward II. It is too bad that this is just about the only film version of The Tempest available.,negative
at first i thought 'nasaan ka man' might be one of those progressive new filipino films. as someone noted earlier  the movie does not look poorly made. it's clear that the directors used more expensive cameras to shoot  better angles  better sound equipment  good-looking actors  and nicer locations.<br /><br />however  the improvements are all purely superficial. if it weren't for all the polish and expensive filters  'nasaan ka man' would feel just like your typical  second-rate local movie - - hyperactive drama  predictable plot twists  yeah right! moments  crying  screaming  and characters you could care less about  all shoved down your throat.<br /><br />a couple of things annoyed me about this movie. first of all  since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family? that not-blood-related argument does not make an ounce of difference. second  would a woman really not tell anyone for 40 years that she was raped  simply because the father told her to keep it secret? and  where the hell were the lights in this movie? i know the director tried to make things look super dramatic  but i was simply forced to turn up the brightness feature on my TV set.,negative
"This is one of four 1970s movies by TV writer Lane Slate about sensationalistic murders in small towns. They feature likable TV personalities as police chiefs and quirky characters as town regulars  including light-touch love interests. The others are: They Only Kill Their Masters (James Garner  1972); and The Girl In The Empty Grave and Deadly Game (both Andy Griffith  1977).<br /><br />Alda's is set near Vermont (Mount Angel next to Horse Creek); the others in California  Garner's at seaside (Eden Landing) and Griffith's in the mountains (Jasper Lake). All try to capture the feel of a small town  to move at a relaxed pace among comfortable characters  and to tell a mystery with at least some complicated twist or turn to it. On that level  they are somewhat entertaining (that they were often re-run itself suggests they have some appeal). But they suffer from overall thin stories and dialogue  slack pacing  bland settings  flat or exaggerated characters  and off-putting  forced attempts (often juvenile or crude) at color or humor.<br /><br />Alda's and Garner's are the most serious about story  characters  pacing  and tone. They have the best supporting casts  though Alda's is put to better use; the Griffith casts pale in comparison. Alda's has the best director.<br /><br />Shocking has some surprise and drama. The killer's method is inventive. The tone is more even  and the dialogue more natural  than in Griffith's. Alda's film does not suffer like the others from smug big-city transplants to the town or from hokey  exaggerated local characters  both of which come across as figments of a Hollywood scriptwriter  not as genuine (the worst offender is the Griffith movies' pipsqueak  mumbling moron Whit, who  we are told  tried to hook a jeep up to and make off with a trailer serving as a temporary bank branch  dragged away the dock for the police boat  stole tomatoes from a farmer's truck only to get nothing for them  and filled out $11 on the withdrawal slip of Spiro T. Babylis only to be discovered by the teller). Mercifully absent is the clunky  heavy-handed repetitive-style dialogue from the Griffith movies (You going to lunch? I'm going to take out the boat. You going to take the boat to lunch? I'm not going to lunch. You're not going to take the boat to lunch?; There aren't any fish in this lake. Why are you fishing here? It's illegal in Horse Mountain. It's posted here too, you're breaking the law. Some law. There aren't any fish in this lake. Then why are you fishing here? I told you, it's illegal in Horse Mountain.; Please call me Lloyd. My name is Lloyd. Okay, Lloyd... Call me Lloyd. That's my name. My name is Lloyd.)<br /><br />But Alda is too low-key and unimpressive to be taken seriously as even a small-time police chief  certainly not a red-hot lawman in demand by a rival town. Slate has the character admit as much  when he comes late to the scene of a by then obvious clue  as a result of an accidental name recognition. Rather than detect or investigate  Barnes strikes out blindly in emotional denial. His secretary Lasser feeds him a key clue (Why didn't I think of that, he says!). An embarrassing funeral scene  plus a plot contrivance  leads to another gift clue.<br /><br />Worse  Barnes is more interested in deriding the military-style helmets of the county police sent to help him (Deadly Game also suggests Slate has something against the military) than leading them or his own men effectively. He allows a late murder by incompetently guarding a known target. Barnes allows his car to be repeatedly rammed by the killer fleeing one crime scene  without drawing his gun or trying to take control. Again  he is ineffective  and nearly killed  in the climactic scene  which results from multiple errors on his part that are only partially corrected  by accident. The erratic Northeastern accent that Alda affects does not help believability.<br /><br />There are plot holes. Why would the killer strike after all these years? And committing the first two murders without a trace seems implausible. But they are nothing compared to later ones -- a couple together  a shopkeeper in his store during business hours  a fully clothed deputy seated in his office and  unbelievably  his dog!<br /><br />Alda's movie also suffers from some offensive elements that Slate injects into all the movies. Barnes first appears in a motel clerk's bed. He then treats her rudely at every turn and insults and tries to avoid her kids. This  and talk about the female doctor  smack of a crude  mean-spirited pattern (Garner's film has been described as sleazy, including a scene where he and a deputy laugh about how a girl in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy in the car with her. Griffith's feature an ersatz Ropers routine  in which the woman embarrassingly tries to coax the man into the supply closet; a gratuitous locker-room-type exchange with a deputy in discussing a young woman's car accident death (Did you take her out? I took her in once.); a reference to bank teller Bernice as swollen-up in places and to sticking a pin in her and to hating and firing secretary Maude because she was too hairy; a description of the female doctor's practice as two stirrup tables and a flashlight; a humiliating scene in which Fran Ryan propositions Griffith  offering some home grown; and an insulting subplot in which a woman  pursued by a deputy played as a drippy buffoon  seems to sleep around).<br /><br />Finally  Alda's film has a grim  bleached-out  colorless  lifeless look and feel. Only Louise Lasser adds spark. At least the other films had some spirit  scenery  and pleasant music; Griffith's got out onto the mountainside  onto the lake  and even out into the big city. You feel more like re-watching Masters or Empty Grave than Shocking.",negative
Oh my... bad clothing  worse synth music and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The 80's are back with vengeance in Witchery  an American-Italian co-production  helmed by infamous Joe 'D'Amato on the production side and short-careered director (thank heavens for small miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti directing . Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (that was dubbed La Casa in there)  Witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting.<br /><br />A mix of ghost story  possessions and witchcraft  the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow it's progress to expectable ending  topped with some serious WTF surprise climax. (I just love the look on her face...) Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes; unluckily for him  these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.<br /><br />The plus sides are experienced  when the gore hits the fan. This department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's Italo-gore  when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow. I could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that obnoxious characters (and actors) got mangled and misused  one by one. I only felt sorry for Linda Blair  who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career  or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.<br /><br />Well  folks - not much more to tell  and even less to tell home about. Don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this  and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun. It also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror. And speaking of hearts - every movie that has David Hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors  MUST have it's one on the right place.<br /><br />This is my truth - what is yours?,negative
It's been mentioned by others the inane dialogue in this series and I agree.<br /><br />If Mom and daughter were really that sharp-witted they should be Queen and Princess of the Universe  not kicking around in some little town.<br /><br />I've really tried to watch a few episodes but when the witty staccato mumbling pop culture drivel starts I flip the channel.<br /><br />I watched a bit of a new episode to see if anything had changed (for the better I'd hoped) but nope  same old we're so clever with our references to pop culture that I nearly barfed.<br /><br />Long time fans who aren't happy with the newer seasons might just be wising up and getting sick of the regurgitated pablum that never stops.,negative
I decided to watch this show and give it a go but I found it to be boring  and more importantly dull.....Dull.<br /><br />There is far too much sarcasm and the characters are all dull  there is far too much talking and the character Lorelai...just keeps talking on and on and on.... During a second glance felt like suffocating the characters  the banter doesn't work and the whole love and romance thing just ruins what is already a crap show....I can't believe this show survived past the pilot.... This seems to be a show which forces the 'Listen to your parents' line....No actual drama exists....<br /><br />Should have stayed a pilot.....and a pilot alone...,negative
When I first watch this series  the impression I got was that the characters were charming and funny  Lorelai and Rory in particular were witty and intelligent conversationalist albeit a bit too talkative. After watching it for some time  however  my opinion changed.<br /><br />The main characters slowly revealed themselves to be self-centered self-obsessed narcissists  who treated tiny wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence. For example  Rory wouldn't speak to her mother for months when Lorelai didn't consult her on her impulsive marriage  while Lorelai dumped Luke for simply wanting a little time to adjust to his new life circumstances. These people are shallow  see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to how their own rigid rules  and if they don't  they will hold grudges against them for an eternity. They don't want to see other people's problems and treat the smallest slight as the gravest offence. Most of the characters appear to lack the ability to behave in a grown-up way. They think they should do whatever that they wanted and everyone else be damned.<br /><br />The series is character-based  so when the main characters became so unlikeable the show also became impossible to watch. I still have the rest of the series  but I doubt if I will ever finish watching them. I will also hold anyone who think highly of the show and its awful characters with the greatest suspicion - they must just as horrid as Lorelai et al.,negative
I tired on several attempts to sit down and watch this program Gilmore Girls. It baffled me for I just couldn't put my finger on what this was about. Was this about a young woman having a baby young in life and never growing up? Was this about the daughter being more responsible than the mother? Was this about a rebellious rich girl and her non-rebellious daughter? What the heck is this show about? Finally  I just didn't care. The cast makes me want to scream. The writing is neither smart or intelligent it's syrupy and tedious.<br /><br />So why did I watch? Because I heard SO many good things about this and I am not one to voice an opinion until I have watched. Knee-Jerk reactions are usually wrong  so I watched a few times. The first time I watched this  I saw the mother running around like she was 12 and the daughter acting like she was 40. Maybe that is what didn't attract me. I never liked any of the Freaky Friday films - not to say this is like that  but there are some similarities. <br /><br />Also I have a friend who watches this show every week. So I asked her  What is this show about? A very bright young lady  usually articulate she never could give me a straight answer. So I asked others who rave about it - they really don't know either.<br /><br />Gilmore Girls is turning out to be a TV program that's like an art house movie. Many of us wont get it  but those that go try desperately to find a meaning where there really isn't one  just to be hip. Yes  I find Lauren Graham's Lorelai annoying - whine  whine  nasally WHINE. A whole hour of that. Wow. And the rest of the cast is about as memorable as yesterday's cheese sandwich. The town is hokey  the men are wimps  the grand parents are boring  and sadly I find nothing redeeming about any of these characters or care about anything they do. It's like watching paint dry on the wall.,negative
"Usually when I don't see a show on an original run  I find it later on cable and realize it's a gem. The Gimore Girls is one of those rare exceptions. I'm glad I missed it.<br /><br />I truly despise shows that fill every minute of the actors space with rambling  stupid  boring banter. This is one hour of just that. The mother  Lorelei  made me wonder if she is Bipolar and off her lithium. She never stopped talking; every minute  every second  talking to every person she interacted with. Worse yet  her speech is childish and soooo  like  Valley Girl. She talked about guys  her hair  her mother  her clothes. Like  what's the sitch?? (for situation). I've watched this show three times and still don't get the point of this series. It's not a comedy  it's not a drama  it has no point except to make three generations of females in one family look like the Girls from Planet Mars. The males by comparison are smart and make the show somewhat watchable. If Lorelei ever existed and attempted to latch onto me with conversation  I'd have to mace her to get rid of her. She obviously doesn't know how to take a subtle hint to stop talking and start listening to someone else. She also doesn't know how to really notice the existence of others.<br /><br />In one show Lorelei comes home from a date close to 10 pm. She got the date after pursuing a guy she met at an auction. She goes into her daughter's room where the daughter asks how it went. She dithers on about how boring the guy was. Her date somehow got a few words in edgewise. Lorelei complained about how the man didn't stop talking (choke). Hopefully the date learned how fortunate he was.<br /><br />One other person here commented on how the mother acts like a teen and the daughter is the adult personality. Lorelei even dresses like her kid. This obviously 40-something mom dresses and looks like she hit the mall with her high school pals in tow.<br /><br />I thought that this show should have been followed by Just Shoot Me, because that's exactly how I felt.",negative
This is an absolutely horrid excuse for a show. People say its witty and intelligence? I don't see how? Maybe because the characters use fancy words? Maybe because they are snooty  use dry humor  and have 2 dimensional personalities. I went to an Ivy league school and nobody acted anywhere near as obnoxious as these characters. In fact had I met someone like them I would have likely strangled them! The men act like little emotional pre-teen girls and all the minority characters are based off stereotypes... The characters are no AT ALL AUTHENTIC. Simply put they sound like a trailer park family trying to be rich and sophisticated. This show is just another cookie-cutter hit that brain-dead prime time viewers eat up on a regular basis.,negative
The preposterous premise of this flick has to do with Argentina reclaiming the Falkland Islands  having failed through force in 1982  by impregnating the European women inhabitants with Argentinean sperm thereby diluting the ethnic purity until it favored Argentina. Yeah  right. The reconnaissance is done by our hero/villan and cad  Fabian  who hauls his fish-eye camcorder from pillar to post secretly filming his encounters with the Falklanders including his courting and eventual conquest of one woman  Camilla. An unfortunate indie and fraudulent documentary  this flick favors us with lots of boring tourism shot from the hip....yada  yada  yada. The film has no plot potential and only begins to become interesting as Fabian and Camilla wend their way through the usual moments of awkwardness and uncertainty as they get from the handshake to the bed. F*ckland is only for those cinema purists who can appreciate the bleak  no frills  jigglecam austerity of Dogme indies.,negative
I will confess that once I started watching this movie  it had a hold on me that forced me to watch it through to its conclusion. Quite possibly this was some latent voyeuristic tendency in me that wanted to see our hero get it on with his victim  or maybe fascination that they got funding to make  distribute  and show this film that kept me searching it for merit  or possibly some bizarre wish-fulfillment fantasy that there might be a point at the end of all the pain. But no such luck.<br /><br />So you are warned to not start watching it in the first place  lest the same thing happen to you. There's nothing here worth wasting your hour and a half on.<br /><br />The first-person mockumentary and the schtick about Fabian's quest to impregnate women of the Falklands comes out even more like a sophomoric (maybe Freshman - high school Freshman  that is) film student project than you might imagine. The effect ends up being both sneering at the local inhabitants (who  other than the two professional leads  are in fact real people) as well as engaging in rather disgusting sexual politics (no matter whether you take it all literally or symbolically  it's pointless and sexist).<br /><br />The reason I ended up watching it all the way is the same reason that once one starts to pick at a scab  there's an irresistable fascination of continuing to do so until it's completely off  even when you know it's bad for you. You just want to see what happens.<br /><br />In the end  this is rather dishonest filmmaking  because it seems ultimately to have no moral center  no elucidation of the local political situation  nor any place in the type of political-sexual-personal film universe a la Goddard. In short it's got nothing to say and spends a long time pretending it does. Smug would be the one-word tagline.<br /><br />I'd suggest the filmmakers rent 'Waiting for Guffman' a few times  or hell  even 'Blair Witch Project' if they want to pursue the schtick with a little more style and a little more genuine emotion. Or at least entertainment value.,negative
I watched Fuckland a long time ago. I lied if I'd tell that I remember it in detail; what I remember most vividly is the irritation it provoked me and the feeling of a total waste of precious money and time  not only my time and money invested in watching the movie but also the director's.<br /><br />Supposedly  Fuckland is a critic of Argentinians  presenting us (I'm an Argentinian too) as little people who take credit for and even boast about petty  ridiculous victories  and think we're the best thing that God (who is also an Argentinian) created. I'm not going to argue that. It's probably a true statement about a quite big part of the population (the part I despise  by the way). And even if this weren't true  that's not my point. The worst sin Fuckland committed was to express such a statement about its own director.<br /><br />The continuous impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us for sneaking a camera inside the islands to worry about making a good (even a mediocre) movie. Many of the takes made with a hidden camera are pointless. The director chooses to show off with a silly edition of old war takes and his own ones. And there's no plot at all.<br /><br />Moreover  this movie proudly presents a Dogme certificate before the opening titles  only to disrespect its principles afterwards (for example  by including the director in the credits - another sign of his pride?).<br /><br />I found the movie offensive  not as an Argentinian  but as a watcher. I felt underestimated. Fuckland is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen.,negative
Now and again  a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity. We just finished studying the novel  Northanger Abbey  at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unexciting piece of humourless garbage with the BBC adaptation.<br /><br />The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself. The film is NOTHING like the book  for example  the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like a leprechaun on acid while Isabella plays the role of slut. Catherine  the main character  is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on god's earth (she looks like a coffee addict  her eyes are like basketballs) whilst Mr Tilney looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double. The plot goes completely off the rails at certain points of the film  I don't know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all  a 7 year old black kid who we've never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts cartwheeling in front of her. Yes  that's right  cartwheeling. Nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by Catherines fantasies in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogre.<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that  BBC have basically discovered a new way to kill someone. Northanger is a barely laughably bad film. Don't watch it unless you're in a padded cell.,negative
An Italian/American co-production co-starring Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff: how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat?<br /><br />Well  based on the uneventful  extremely tedious  and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so  I would have said 'very easily'; thankfully  however  things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes  and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy  a smattering of nudity too (unfortunately  my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material).<br /><br />The Hoff stars as Gary  a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project  a book about witches; whilst there  frustrated Gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity.<br /><br />His plans for nookie are scuppered  however  by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross)  their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair)  son Tommy (Michael Manchester)  pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland)  and estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth)  who have come to inspect the island's hotel.<br /><br />After explaining their unexpected presence on the island  Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners  and when a violent storm suddenly picks up  making it perilous to return to the mainland  everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building. Unfortunately  unbeknownst to the hotel's new guests  the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch (Hildegard Knef)  who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life. One by one  victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex (which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs)  before meeting a terrible fate.<br /><br />None of this makes much sense  and the acting is atrocious (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad  whilst Hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers  which speaks volumes about the others)  but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: Rose has her lips sewn together  before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish(!!); Freddie's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood; and Gary gets stabbed in the back.<br /><br />Oh  and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possessed (again).,negative
Awful  dreadful  terrible. The actors are bad  the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic. I rented the DVD and had to force myself to watch it until the end.<br /><br />My advice: read the book  it is much better and you won't have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams Catherine has.<br /><br />I think I have never watched such a bad movie.,negative
I've seen some terrible book-to-film adaptations in my day  but this one tops them all! The bizarrely unattractive cast detracts from the story  which is  in itself  untrue to the book. Mr. Tilney is nothing like handsome; as for Catherine Morland  a rat-like appearance makes this heroine a difficult one to sell to a sympathetic audience. Isabella is nothing like the Aphrodite one reads about in the original text  and James Morland appears in the film far too little to leave the viewer with any understanding of his important role in the story. Also  as others have pointed out before  this novel was intended to satirize the Gothic craze prevalent in Austen's time  but it appears that this soft horror film was designed and meant to be taken seriously. I'm sure Jane Austen turns over in her grave each time one of her fans is disappointed by this awful interpretation of what was supposed to be a joke.,negative
"We really don't know where to begin when talking about this movie. But we'll start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that whomever wrote/produced/directed this movie never read the book. Because they missed the entire point. SATIRICAL  not horror. Just a hint. Second  the bath scene. Enough said. Third  the added characters. The sketchy Gothic french lady and her black page who enjoys holding hands and cartwheeling. We don't understand where this came from either. And then there was the casting. All of them were really unlikeable. We were very upset that Catherine and Mr. Tilney ended up together  because they were so unlikable that no one would ever wish to see them happy. And...the music. We think that the BBC producers ran out of money  so raided their grandmother's attic. And they found some old records. Saxophone  wailing female voices  and an occasional electric guitar. *shudder*<br /><br />Plus  the best line ever: Since you left, the white rose bush has died of grief. If anybody has any explanation  we would love to hear it. Because it makes absolutely no sense.<br /><br />We are still wondering what on earth everyone involved was thinking when they cruelly released this pathetic excuse of a movie out on the public. We think it should be considered a federal offense. Torture is illegal.<br /><br />This movie is by far the worst we have seen to date. And I've seen a lot of movies.<br /><br />Our recommendation: Give this movie to whomever you hate. They will watch it  and want to kill themselves. And we agree with a previous post  we would give this 0 stars  if at all possible. DO NOT WATCH!! And we strongly suspect that everyone who commented so far in favor of this movie were involved in its production. Or were mentally insane. These are the only reasons we have been able to come up with that would instigate giving a favorable review.",negative
It is hard for a lover of the novel Northanger Abbey to sit through this BBC adaptation and to keep from throwing objects at the TV screen-in fact  if Jane Austen herself were to see this  she would be somewhat amused and possibly put out. Maggie Wadey's adaptation has made Northanger Abbey into what it satirized  the Gothic novel (and the readers of Gothic novels).<br /><br />The role of Catherine Morland in the adaptation is portrayed fairly closely to Austen's Catherine  a open-hearted  generous girl whose imagination simply runs away with her. But the Henry Tilney of the novel is not a snuff-taking  cane-wielding  sappy-line-making hero of a Gothic novel-he is a tease  a nearly-handsome man with a messy room and a living (that's right  Henry Tilney is a clergyman  a charm that is completely dropped from the script). Some of the best scenes from novel  when Henry  completely deadpan  outrageously teases the literally-minded Catherine on diction  journals  Mrs. Radcliffe  etc.  are not portrayed in the adaptation. A large section of Henry's personality is lost when those scenes are not adapted. Besides  Peter Firth's appearance is not accurate-Henry Tilney is supposed to be 24 or 25  dark hair and a brown skin  not 35 or 40 and blond.<br /><br />There are so many other absurdities within the adaptation that invoke surprise and disgust-who is the Marchioness  and what is she doing in the story?! Why is John Thorpe less of a dunce and more of a schemer? Why is Northanger Abbey a castle? Catherine of the novel  with her romantic visions  expects hidden passages and dark tapestries  but is very disappointed to discover that Northanger Abbey is actually a comfortable  modern house-another element of satire! Why portray General Tilney as a drunk? Why does Catherine have those strange visions of Mrs. Allen threading her finger  etc.? Catherine's imagination only runs away with her at Northanger  with Henry there to correct her gently. And lastly  why are so many facts concerning the Tilney family and Mrs. Tilney's death altered unnecessarily? To make the story more `horrible?' All of these oddities and more simply are too strange to be overlooked.<br /><br /> >,negative
This is a terrible movie  that is barely recognizable from the book  although they have sort of similar plots. The time it takes to watch this movie (which is only 1.5 hours) would be much better spent doing anything else  including watching grass grow. The addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make Catherine seem insufferably silly. The actress who plays Catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised  even when she's supposed to be looking lovingly into her Tilney's eyes. Honestly!! The movie ends with a Catherine fantasy-like scene where one can't help but wonder if it's happened or if she's merely delusional  and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie. The only good thing about the movie is the title  which was written by Ms. Austen herself. I generally love the BBC's productions but this one is horrid.,negative
(This might have a spoiler)<br /><br />When I first started watching this movie  I thought it was OK. The music was good and that bizarro dream sequence I was willing to forgive  but the lack of looks in the main character and all of the other characters for that matter made me uninterested in watching the rest of this film. (I know  totally vain.)The music at the beginning was spirited and fitting I thought for a mock Gothic novel. But  come on! Saxophone music for an early 19th century film? It totally didn't fit. This movie was totally boring and if you're looking to watch a good period film or an Austen don't rent Northanger Abbey! I give it a 30%. 30% = a failing grade!,negative
Poor Jane Austen. This dog of a production does NOT do her wonderful tongue in cheek novel any justice. Starting at the top ... poorly adapted. The screenwriter deserves extra low marks for trying to -- come to think of it  I don't know WHAT she was trying for  but suffice it to say she missed the mark by light years!! Couple that with all the over-acting and awful production values  this is one adaptation that should never have happened. It would have been far better if they just gave all the money they poured into this flop and donated it to a worthy charity. Do yourself a favor  read the book. It is almost certain that you will enjoy it a thousand times more than trying to sit through this excruciating production!,negative
I'm afraid I did not like this adaptation. When I started watching it I had a strange feeling of watching some 70s TV series  due to the filter and the musical score. I did not like the end scene. Mr Tilney appears dressed only in his waistcoat. Jane Austen would never have a gentleman ride out without a frock coat. Looks like the producers made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girl's dream. I appreciate the more modern JA adaptations much more  that show an eye for these details  that makes the BBC series so worthwhile. Sorry  looking forward to the 2007 adaptation. I hope that will be better and will show the benefits of 20 years of Jane Austen adaptations.,negative
What an awful adaptation. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's?????? The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one  and I love Jane Austen movies usually. I didn't even rent it  I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the bad guys and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good  isn't. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen.,negative
Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel  but it has its charms. This movie doesn't. It has some of the same character names as the book  but the story is drastically altered  and the sweetest man in the whole Austen canon (unless Emma's Mr. Knightley gets pride of place) is made out to be a heartless and mercenary creep. One or two totally extraneous characters are introduced  and a palpable air of corseted perversion hangs over it all. I was so disappointed when I first saw it on its release in 1986; even today it ranks high on the list of films that disgrace the books on which they're based. Even Robert Hardy fans should give this one a wide berth. It has nothing  and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G  to recommend it.,negative
Talented screenwriter Alvin Sargent sadly cannot get any engaging ideas cooking in this artificial trifle about a wayward mother and her mature teenage daughter trying to make their lives work in Los Angeles despite mom's flighty behavior. Apart from several good sequences  I didn't quite buy Susan Sarandon as a flake (she's too intrinsically smart and focused to be passed off as this devil-may-care lady)  and her naturally grounded personality is a bad fit for the role of an irresponsible parent. Natalie Portman fares much better as her kid  and yet there's a creepy aloofness to her work (and some of her scenes  such as the one where she asks a boy to strip  are misguided and uncomfortable to watch). Certainly not an incompetent piece  Anywhere But Here does have moments that work  but it isn't an embraceable film  nor has it proved to be an important one. ** from ****,negative
The filmmakers were clearly on drugs. That's the only explanation I have. How else do you explain this travesty of a Jane Austen adaptation? Northanger Abbey is a parody of a Gothic novel. But this film was made as if it WERE a Gothic novel. The bizarre music and dream sequences to me suggest drug-induced hallucinations rather than a naive  innocent girl with an overactive imagination  as Catherine of the novel is...<br /><br />The actress who played Catherine just stands around bug-eyed all the time. Peter Firth looks at least 10 years too old to play Henry and he actually seemed a bit on the gay side to me. I don't see the attraction between him and Catherine. John Thorpe's portrayal was rather odd but Isabella actually wasn't that bad. But nothing could save this PIECE OF CRAP movie! One more thing- This film invents a character not in the book  a French friend of General Tilney's  The Marchioness. Why exactly they added her is beyond me. Must have been the drugs. She is scary-looking beyond belief  with white foundation  red lips and black lines randomly painted on her face (dimples?).<br /><br />You'd think this would at least be entertaining in a so bad it's good quality but unfortunately  it's not. It's just BAD.,negative
Shaky hand held cameras (this piece was shot for television mind you  not film) not only keep you utterly conscious of how horrible the cinematography is in this film  but make you absolutely unable to become immersed in the story. Poor Miss Austen must be rolling in her grave. All I can say is  if you enjoyed the novel  stop there  until the BBC creates one of their smart & sensible period masterpieces (like Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth  which  speaking for what I imagine in my opinion  Austen would have revered). The BBC would never dare overdub cheesy saxophone solos and Indigo Girl hollers over a shot of an historic castle and a loving embrace. Giles Foster seemed to be often confused that they were editing the music to The Specialist. If you want Austen as you love her  look for the BBC logo...,negative
The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be ashamed of themselves for foisting this unfortunate production onto the world. The acting is  with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney  amateurish at best and excruciatingly painful at worst. The costumes are over-the-top and feature some truly ghoulish excesses -- was the costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? Surely EVERY woman in Bath didn't have feathers in her headpiece in the early 19th century. The production values are poor and the pacing of the film makes one feel it was hastily and clumsily edited at the last minute. Altogether an agonizing film that I had to force myself to watch to the end. It's a shame  as the producers obviously spent a lot of money on costumes and location shooting. Compared to Emma Thompson's sublime Sense and Sensibility or the extraordinary 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice or the subtle intensity of 1995's Persuasion  this production of `Northanger Abbey' surely has Jane Austen turning in her grave.,negative
This movie started off well enough  sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch. The soundtrack was torturously bad. Saxaphone and electric guitars? It was gratingly incongruous. The female singer was positively dreary! In the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to Catherine's eyes.<br /><br />Who in the heck is this Marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig? A totally extraneous and unnecessary character.<br /><br />One of the key elements in the book is the General is not a Gothic monster like the characters in Catherine's books. His monstrosity is far more complicated in his oppression of his children's spirits and his treatment of Catherine based on money concerns alone. He does not lock up his wife or kill her but he does send Miss Morland on a 70 mile trip alone in a hired carriage with not enough money to pay her way home. Only her friend Miss Tilney's thoughtfulness in handing her some money on the way out the door saves her from being stranded. This whole point gets seriously muddled in the film. They make the General too dark from the outset.<br /><br />Peter Firth should have not sung! This part was painful to watch. His depiction of Tilney wasn't too bad but it was a shade dark in places. Henry Tilney of the book made sport of Miss Morland's imagination on trip to Northanger but he was never dark. Firth would have benefited from better direction. The young lady who played Isabella needed a better acting coach. John Thorpe was appropriately odious. The striped waistcoat and coattails combo he wore was ghastly! It certainly fit his character.<br /><br />I think the film would have fared much better with a completely different soundtrack. It cast an oppressive pall over the entire movie. If I watch it again it will be with the sound OFF and subtitles on. Perhaps I would give the film a 4 then.<br /><br />The sound quality of the DVD was quite poor. The picture quality was not much better. This is glaringly noticeable on a digital television.<br /><br />When I think of what this film could have been  I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.,negative
"My mom  my cousins  and I are pretty big Jane Austen fans. We know all the words to the 1995 Pride and Prejudice masterpiece  and have watched Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma an embarrassing number of times. I've read all the books  and I've even sat through Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a few times. So my mom and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey on film.<br /><br />Bad idea! This is just about the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass  or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $1 (my previous worst movies.) The first thing wrong  which you notice in the opening scene  is that the heroine, Catherine  has a gruesome and weird imagination  inspired by trashy novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch. Throughout the novel  she has dreams (day and night) in which she is carried off by some hideous man with a greasy wig  dragged across a field headed for God-knows-what-all  and suddenly rescued by a dashing guy on a white horse.<br /><br />The second thing any viewer of the movie will instantly notice is the high-pitched wailing and saxophone music that is supposed to be the soundtrack. No dainty classical music or English country dances here! It is also evident  almost at first glance  that the actress (for lack of a better word) chosen to play Catherine is completely off. First  she is rather unattractive  and is rendered even more so by her un-Austenlike behavior. Her looks and movements are just wacky! Plus  they're completely affected and unbelievable.<br /><br />This sad lack of acting skills affects pretty much all of the actors in the film. Not even Mr. Tilney  the supposed dashing young suitor is decent.<br /><br />As more and more characters are introduced  a strange taste in costumes on the part of the filmmakers becomes evident. Huge  Marie Antoinette-style headdresses clash with the (for the most part) correctly styled Empire gowns. A French woman  apparently a friend of General Tilney's  is made up all in black as some sort of ancient Goth nightmare--she bears a striking similarity to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is made even sillier by a HUGE half-moon beauty mark on her cheek. I also had to wonder about the historical accuracy of the bright red lipstick that almost all of the women were wearing.<br /><br />Another anomaly that kept my mom and I howling with laughter for about ten minutes was the bathing scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women were bathing in a big bathhouse together--probably not very likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all the women seemed to be wearing large china or plastic plates  worn around their necks with strings. The plates floated horizontally on the water  containing some mysterious pieces of...something. We guessed it was soap  then aromatic herbs  then finally  when the mystery substance began disappearing between shots  we deduced it was food. But I'm still not sure.<br /><br />And that's not even half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone who is considering renting this movie: stay your hand. And if anyone is considering BUYING it--well  I don't even know what to say to that.<br /><br />You'd think that when the actors and others making this film got about 1/4 of the way through  they'd realize what a monster they were creating and stop. Unfortunately  they didn't  and Northanger Abbey was let out into the world.",negative
My first hugely disappointing BBC/Jane Austen flick. The tone is off  the costumes are off  the hair is off  the music is from outer space  and Robert Hardy  bless him  looks like he's really annoyed to be in such a stinker. Even some of the casting is off. No  I take that back  a good director can make a silk purse out of a sows ear  so to speak. The performances in this thing are so over the top and melodramatic that it's almost a farce of a Jane Austen story  which is ironic since Northanger Abbey is a sort of homage/send up of the early Gothic novel. I wanted to slap the female lead after awhile; who made the decision that she should be such a ninny? I had to watch Pride & Prejudice ('95) immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Phew!,negative
Is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating? Because this one deserves it. While I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books  I sat through this one with two women who are. Well  at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing  though he overdid it as he usually does (nearly as bad as William Shatner). But that wasn't enough to save this stinker from total suckitude. It's often hard to separate the girl's dream sequences from what is really happening  and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on. Too many loose ends and the ending feels like a tune in again next week climax. The lead actress is too ditsy and weird-looking to be a heroine  the leading man is too goofy-looking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new-agey pet project of the director's hippy daughter (I mean saxophone??? mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing?). So  in conclusion  I suggest you blow the budget and order a DVD of this one as soon as possible. Especially if you like disappointment.,negative
This film is about a couple that decides to take a vacation to The Everglades along with another couple and the family dog. When they first get there  they are not welcomed by the neighboring gas attendant that warms them to stay away from the cabin in which they are to spend the night at for the week. After pestering with the old man  three hillbillys also do not take kindly to their arrival as they approach their car and threaten them to leave. After asking some of the local dummies that can't speak or just don't want to answer  they finaly find the cabin. After they settle in  strange things happen to the visitors including discovering crap on their car  the man thats the head of this trip thats an idiot shoots the family dog thinking it was a killer clawing at the door and a series of deaths later on in the end. Adding a church group did not make the story any better. Then at the end  the idiot that survives the whole ordeal goes around the town carrying a shot gun. Lame. thats what this movie is.,negative
Normally BBC productions of Jane Austen are pretty good but Northanger Abbey is just odd. What were they thinking? This film has little of Austen's charm and ironically mimics the Gothic novels that Austen so wonderfully mocked. Not only that  the gothic sequences are tacky  over-the-top  and frankly silly. The actress playing Miss Morland is poorly cast with no obvious appeal to attract the attentions of an eligible bachelor  and though I rather liked the creepy Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney  he is not a bit like the novel  even when delivering dialog straight out of the book. Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of his few terribly ham performances. This film was so bizarre and strange that I actually watched it again just to savor how freakishly wrong it was.,negative
Poor Jane Austen ought to be glad she's not around to see this dreadful wreck of an adaptation. So many great Jane Austen movies have come out recently that this one deserves to be permanently buried along with two other movies I despise-The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit and the 1969 version of David Copperfield. My main beef with the movie is that it completely misses the point of the book. Jane Austen was poking fun at the Gothic mania in her society  and much of the novel is tongue in cheek. The movie  however  is serious and comes across terribly melodramatically. The lighthearted  fun-poking flavor of Austen's writing is completely and conspicuously absent from this ponderous foray iinto horror meets period drama. The scenes of Catherine's imagination are both gratuitous and uninteresting. Also  Henry Tilney is dreadfully unappealing. Why  I ask  would anyone fall for him? If you are looking for a fun-filled Jane Austen evening  watch Emma instead!,negative
Sometimes  changes to novels when they're made into films are not only necessary  but a good thing. However  in the case of Northanger Abbey  it's a very  very bad thing. Not only is the story itself ripped to shreds  but the satire is almost completely absent from the film  and it's mixture of romance and intrigue doesn't even touch upon the biting commentary that Austen put into her work. It fails to be amusing or satirical at all  and instead turns the character's fascination with her fantasy world into mostly a drama.<br /><br />This affects the romance as well. It's meandering and aimless. Chemistry and interest are never established. The reasons Tilney is attracted to Catherine are completely absent from the film  leaving the audience to wonder what it is he sees in her at all.<br /><br />Hopefully some day soon  we'll get a more faithful version if Austen's satire.,negative
In my opinion  the movie was laughable--bad dialogue. Whoever wrote the script--please keep your day job. It's definitely NO Godfather or Goodfellas. It's good to be on the otherside of the table--poor choice of words. Some of the characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low budget movie with no name actors.,negative
Wow  what a racist  profane piece of celluloid garbage  and what an insult to the great genre of Westerns.<br /><br />Exploitive? Sex scenes abound  profanity abounds  violence and gore abounds.....everything that gives modern movies such a good name  especially among those who prefer classic-era movies. This is the kind of sleaze that gives the old folks ammunition against today's films. <br /><br />Somehow I just can't picture nude male bathing scenes in Randolph Scott or Gene Autrey films. Nor can I picture hearing motherf---er! exclaimed here and there. I sincerely doubt that word was even around over 100 years ago. Yet  the f-word is so prevalent here you'd think you were watching a story centered in today's urban areas  not the old west of the 1800s.<br /><br />Prejudice? Well  what if all the white characters were good guys and every black person was the nasty  brutal villain? Do you think someone might complain about a racist movie? Home come we don't hear an outcry when the reverse - as demonstrated in this film - is shown in hundreds of theaters across the country?<br /><br />Mario Van Peeples wrote  directed and starred in this bomb. Remember that name. Apparently  he is the Ed Wood of today's filmmakers. Even Spike Lee wouldn't be this racist. You can't get much worse than this movie.,negative
This is the worst movie of ALL TIME! It's one of those that is so ridiculous and the acting so bad that you turn off the video 1/3 into it so that you can use your time for better purposes like cleaning the toilet. If you actually watch the whole thing  GOD help you.,negative
It's not just that the movie is lame. It's more than that. This movie is just unnecessary. Do we need another Western? How about a western with afro-Americans in the titles roles? Sound stupid  implausible and a lame attempt at modernizing the genre? It is. Incredibly lame and simple minded. It's like that lame Baz Luhrman film Romeo and Juliet where he set it in modern times to attract young folks and create some hype with his revamping of a classic tale. Well  Baz Luhrman failed miserably and so does this mess. The story is actually not bad however the whole idea of removing the racism out of a racist genre by casting an all afro-American cast is racist in itself. It's also puerile and simple minded (like Baz Luhrman-man he's a bad director). Hey (I hear you say) this was directed by Mario Van Peebles! He's also IN the film! How can it be racist? It's not. I said the idea of casting all afro-Americans instead of Caucasians was. The film isn't racist  it's just pointless  stupid and very very boring.,negative
An awful film; badly written  badly acted  cliched  hackneyed  dross. The premise is such a good one and a chance to educate about black cowboys but the film is truly dire. It is a curious mix of a bad 1950's Randolph Scott B movie and a bad 1970's spaghetti western. The villains are cardboard  the flashbacks laughable  the dialogue excruciating.<br /><br />The deliberate anachronisms (such as 'Victorian' rap singers and modern swear words like motherf****er)  are irritating to the extreme.<br /><br />A Frankenstein monster that died on the lab table.,negative
i think south park is hilarious  and i have no problem w/them taking shots at people on the left  but you'd think that  after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities for risking their careers taking on an illegal war  and then being GASP right along  they would have the sense to start giving w. and the bastards ruining the country a shot or two. bush seems to get a pretty free run from these guys for as stupid and messed up as he is.<br /><br />gore is fair game  but please  what do the republicans have to do  how bad do they have to f^&k up the country before these guys finally act like maybe they aren't just trying to do the best they can  and that they have done some true screwing up...or maybe just go after rush limbaugh...hes a good target...or even just make fun of condoleeza rice's gap teeth.,negative
C.H.O.M.P.S. is very much like any number of cheesy late 70s Disney family comedys-The Cat from Outer Space or Unidentified Flying Oddball  for instance. Utterly devoid of anything creative  beating the same cliches to death  yet vaguely entertaining in a mindless sort of way. The actors won't win any awards  nor will the director  writer  or FX crew  but in its inoffensive ness and bland predicatability there is some vague entertainment to be had. The idea of the robot dog as security system is so full of holes you could use it as a colander. The incredibly repetative disco soundtrack will stick in your head  so beware.,negative
For a scientifically-engineered super-dog that was supposed to be the answer to petit crime  CHOMPS was a chump.<br /><br />All I ever saw Chomps do was sit  or walk  or run. Or run  then walk  then sit... and then get back up again and stretch  and then walk  and then jog to K-Tel dance hits. And sometimes it had all the answers to the daily Jumbo. But mostly it just sat a lot.<br /><br />All I am saying is: In a Celebrity Death Match  Chomps couldn't take out Mr. Bigglesworth.,negative
"My God  the things that passed for entertainment in this country...<br /><br />This is *not* the Tom and Jerry you may have enjoyed on Saturday Mornings  featuring a hapless cat and a clever mouse. This is a much earlier animation series  featuring a pair of Mutt-and-Jeff clones who get themselves into various scrapes that result in any of the then-typical dancing-skeleton-type gags that made up so much of early animation.<br /><br />This particularly vile outing  apparently originally intended as a vehicle for a pair of actual black stage comedians of the time  has the pair crashing in the ocean while flying to Africa  necessitating black-face make-up  exaggerated negro dialect and Feets, don't fail me now situations.<br /><br />It only shows that in the 70 years between emancipation and this film  the American view of Africans hadn't progressed much. Then again  at least one of them apparently had a pilot's license.",negative
An obscure horror show filmed in the Everglades. Two couples stay overnight in a cabin after being made a little uneasy by the unfriendliness of the locals. Who  or what  are the Blood Stalkers? After awhile they find out. Watch for the character of the village idiot who clucks like a chicken  he certainly is weird.,negative
I was under assumption that this was the cat and mouse duo but it wasn't instead it was something that shouldn't have been made not even for its time. They disguise themselves in the blackface fashion because they fly to Africa and they even act like Stepin Fetchit and all the others rolled into one. There are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics  being a mixed woman I have the right to say this  but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons try Merrie Melodies Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs or Angel Puss you won't find them on DVD because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream  but you can find them on a site as YouTube. I don't recommend little kids seeing this but if you want to see how early America was racist and ignorant these are better suggestions  not to mention this particular cartoon has poor animation  i know it was 1932  but I have seen better for its time.<br /><br />Plane unnecessary. -1 out of 10.,negative
"Tom and Jerry are transporting goods via airplane to Africa. But being white men  they're worried they won't be safe  so they put on blackface to fit in. Once they're wearing it  they adopt black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters. They crash into the ocean and use the wing of the plane as a raft. Before reaching land  they suffer the advances of an over-affectionate octopus and more serious danger from sharks  a swordfish and a whale. Once on land  they're frightened by fantastic creatures  and duck into a cave. Inside it's even worse when they encounter living skeletons in blackface. And upon exiting the cave  things are even worse than that when they are discovered by cannibals.<br /><br />Plane Dumb is an especially sloppy effort from Van Beuren Studios. One example: a lion  unknown to Tom and Jerry  enters the cave before they do. But the animators must have forgotten about it  because the lion never appears again. Another example is the ending that's not an ending: it's just an arbitrary stop.<br /><br />According to a YouTube poster  the cartoon was originally intended to feature the voices AND caricatures of a popular 'Negro' comedy team known as Miller & Lyles. But Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording session was completed, and co-directors John Foster & George Rufle were forced to rework the animation into a 'Tom & Jerry' story.<br /><br />They shouldn't have bothered. The crude animation and poorly-executed gags make the film a loser from beginning to end.",negative
While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon  this is not the cat-and-mouse team but an earlier Mutt-and-Jeff rip-off featuring them going to Africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in. While the dialect humor is mostly lame  there is a brief musical sequence involving black skeletons that was entertaining. I have to ask however  how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times? One of many entries produced by the Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO made a deal with Disney. Only worth seeing if you're an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when.,negative
"Tom & Jerry are visiting Africa and disguise themselves in an Amos-n-Andy fashion. They even act and talk differently  with the standard degrading usage of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks portrayed in many cartoons of the era. Aside from the offensive images  this cartoon just isn't very good. Why were they going to Africa in the first place? Apparently just to provide the audience with another Amos-n-Andy and the additionally overused cannibalistic portrayal of native Africans. The only reason this got a 2 instead of a 1 was there is a decent few seconds involving an octopus.<br /><br />Worth one view  which will still leave you shaking your head wondering how ignorance could prevail...<br /><br />(Note. I consider some cartoons containing such racially stereotypical images very good. It all depends on if there is good content surrounding the cartoon  or if the only reason for the existence of the cartoon is to make fun of those incorrectly portrayed. In other words  if you get rid of Mammy, shuffling feet  the poor grammar  and black-face with giant lips images is there anything left? In the case of Plane Dumb there is not.)",negative
"Dumb is right: Tom and Jerry reach their goal of a non-stop air flight to Africa but then worry about mixing in with the natives. They put on blackface, crash the plane  try to survive on an airplane wing floating in the ocean  and then survive the wild animals once they get on land<br /><br />Having read a few reviews before seeing this  I knew what to expect. It was simply these two guys doing their Amos and Andy/Stepin' Fetchit impressions. Offensive to blacks? Of course  but that's the 1930s for you. Some of their lines were funny  some were stupid. The main fault I had with this cartoon was the audio  as it was often not easy to understand what these two guys were saying.<br /><br />In all  a curiosity piece  but don't let the racism stop you from checking it out. At least it gives you an idea of how times have changed....for the better.",negative
This was not a very good movie  the acting pretty much stunk and the effects were bad most of the time. But there were some funny moments but most of those were not meant to be funny. The most hilarious part of the movie to me was the part were a little kid in wheelchair falls out (thats not the funny part What kind of person do you think I am)anyway the kid falls out and starts screaming for his big brother  well the brother comes running and the way the kid runs is so funny he's all stumbling and really over acting I had to rewind it several times so I could laugh some more. so if your looking for something to rent but just can't seem to find anything check this one out and watch for the running part.,negative
Someone else called this film a fable-horror movie  and I think that fits pretty well. That's the concept at least. A group of teenagers  each with their own vice  catch the eye of a twisted sideshow barker. He decides to teach the teens a lesson by making them part of the freak show. A cool idea  but could have been executed better. The fate for some of the teens is shoved in your face too obviously  while other characters could have been fleshed out more. Also  the ending was a serious let down. No resolution or big twist or anything. <br /><br />But as a low budget horror movie  it's pretty fun to watch. If you're into cheesy spookfests  you should have a laugh watching this one. I think one of it's faults though... that it takes itself too seriously. It's a silly movie  and if it was a little more self-aware when it comes to that  I think it would have been better. But at least there's enough neat carnival themes and b-movie monster makeup to keep you watching.,negative
Sideshow is a good example of a basically interesting idea gone very  very wrong. As far as horror movies go  and especially with the influx of teen movies at the moment  a film based around a bunch of teens attending a mysterious freak show is something you could have a lot of fun with.<br /><br />However  the writer decided to make a very straight  very boring  very plain tale about five teens who become part of the show when enraged midget Abbot Graves transforms them into freaks using some pathetic machine that mutates them into beasts.<br /><br />The five teens are picked off one by one until the last guy is left  his 'punishment' being that he is unable to join his friends and thus 'be alone'. What a load of rubbish! <br /><br />The 'actors' are really poor  this film has no comedy (and it could have been so funny!)  no gore (and it could have been so gory!)  no action and no horror (and it could have had so much of both!) <br /><br />The director has failed in his duty to even try to make this a little interesting to watch. His experience in soft-core has obviously disabled any creativity he may ever have had  as all the shots are the same  with very few edits and little movement. The quality overall is poor.<br /><br />I'm not usually swayed by nudity in movies  but believe me the only high point in this film was a pair of breasts.,negative
OK  so my summary line is a cheap trick. But the movie is full of them and it gets absurdly praised  so...<br /><br />I caught this one on TV (uncut  as TV here shows all movies  that's for you Americans who might say I didn't like it because I saw a cut TV version - fortunately that's only an US thing)  and had no idea about what it was. I switched on  caught the last minutes of a show  and the movie began. Within a minute  I was begging it was a comedy  given the particularly ridiculous clichéd beginning (yes  it's a bad movie-within-the-movie  I know  but what a way to try to keep the viewer interested! I don't even know why I didn't switch channels). And  yes  in fact the movie turned out to be a comedy  albeit an unintentional one.<br /><br />Marina Zudina is pretty enough  but gosh  what a dreadful performance! While casting a foreigner in the role is smart enough (she doesn't talk so bye bye language barrier)  yet  sorry  Marina baby  playing mute doesn't mean impersonating Harpo Marx. Her acting is unintentionally funny in many moments  just look at her when she draws an X in the air while stalked by the killer. He wants to kill you  it's no time to play Zorro. We get plenty of running upstairs stuff passing for tension  as in the worst slashers  and things like pulling a carpet and a bad guy shots the other. Ugh! Will Hollywood ever learn? Yet the best/worst pearl is having a guy electrocuted in a bathtub and... Well  I have never seen anyone being electrocuted to death in a bathtub  but I'm sure you can't see the blue cartoon rays in real life  do you? And how about immediately trusting a mean-looking guy because he SAYS he's a cop  and not asking him to show you his credentials? OK  so he turns out to be a real cop. But still  not asking for the badge makes no sense (plot-wise  we could always think the credentials might be phony or he might be a crooked cop. Screen writing 101). And how about the big twist? Don't tell me you didn't see that coming from 200 miles away...<br /><br />I feel sorry for poor old Alec Guinness and his useless stock footage cameo. Now I think about this  what's the point in giving him a Mystery Guest Star credit... in the END titles? The movie's over  there's no mystery anymore  and everybody and their brother have identified Guinness (even non-movie buffs will recognize the old guy from 'Star Wars'). Yet better off this way  so we can pretend it's not the late great actor.<br /><br />People keep comparing this to  of all people  Hitchcock. I suppose it has to be John Hitchcock the milkman  as the late Sir Alfred would feel embarrassed out of watching this  let alone making it. And this gets a 6.8/10???? It's Bottom 100 material! But then  we're talking a rating system that allows 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' to appear as the third best movie ever made (check Top 100)  so...<br /><br />2/10.,negative
Stay away from this movie. Far away. Phil Fondacaro stars as the demented ringleader of a Freakshow. Every performance is flat and unfeeling  except Fondacaro's. The plot is a simple one  and follows almost every horror movie cliche possible. A group of high-school kids go to a carnival  see a side-show  and get in over their heads.<br /><br />Fans of Fred Olen Ray should be warned  this is not like any of his other films. This one is lacking in all departments (humor  sex  horror  etc.) other F.O. Ray movies excell in.<br /><br />The version I saw also contained a Making-Of documentry  in which the director makes comments like We had a limited budget and with our limited timeline which speaks volumes about how much Charles Band cared about this film. Go rent Droid Runner (Fred Olen Ray) or The Dead Hate the Living (Full Moon) instead. Full Moon should be ashamed of themselves (and that's saying a lot after seeing Killer Eye)<br /><br />Grade: D-,negative
this could have been better but it was alright...it helped me get away from my boredom.I didnt even wanna see it the only reason i wanted to rent it is because Jamie Martz is in it..he is a unknown actor but he is shining and is the highlight of the movie...the ending was so horrible and the acting was good for a b movie...i give it a 4 out of 10,negative
This is absolutely beyond question the worst movie I have ever seen. It is so bad in fact that I plan on renting it again as soon as I can find it. This movie makes 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' look like an Oscar contender. Just LOOKING at the actors makes me want to laugh out loud. I cannot say enough bad things about this movie. It's awfulness aproaches perfection.<br /><br />The plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think). That's as far as I can go ... I am laughing too hard. I know it shouldn't be funny but ..... *LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL*<br /><br />MOVE OVER ED WOOD !!!<br /><br />Regard's *DATo*,negative
I'm Mike Sedlak. I co-wrote the score for this movie. And proud of it. <br /><br />And I love all of the comments. Some have not gone far enough.<br /><br />The movie premiered in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was packed with friends and family. We all clapped.<br /><br />Five days latter  it was pulled from all of the screens in the Bay Area.<br /><br />If anyone is interested hearing some of scene by scene details  which might make the movie even more enjoyable  please let me know.<br /><br />We could start with the shot where Gideon Blake throws the toilet plunger to distract one of the evil henchmen guarding the radio transmitter on the deck of Bud's house. <br /><br />Or how Gideon diffused the bomb in the original version.<br /><br />Didn't help. It still bombed.<br /><br />Bring it on.,negative
I was greatly disappointed by the quality of this documentary. The content is poorly produced  very poor quality video and  especially awful audio. There's extremely little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and virtually no examples of direct connection to later and contemporary electronic music. The interviews of people who knew Bruce Haack are ad-hoc mostly inarticulate mumbo-jumbo. Too much yak and not enough Haack. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and have a higher than average attention span  even for slow and/or difficult subject matter  I fell asleep while watching this documentary and had to review it to see the parts I slept through. If you watch this  make sure that you are set up  before viewing  like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Bruce Haack deserves much better than this. Shame on the producer and director.,negative
I don't understand why so many of the comments here seem to indicate that this is acceptable entertainment. The eye-popping horror of this cinematic monstrosity cannot be overstated. Me and my girlfriend just watched it together  and I'm not sure we'll ever be able to have sex again. I'm not sure what was worse  the scrawny  unattractive cast  their supremely unphotogenic genitals  the rancid attempts at humor  the screeching noises that claimed to be songs...<br /><br />No  I know what was worst of all. The girls in the green leotards  with green facepaint  licking Alice to dry her off  then proposing  in broken childlike speech  that they suckle milk from her breasts. That was the worst.<br /><br />Also  what was with the nurses  and why do they seem to have so much trouble finding each other's vaginas? Why are all the male actors gay? Why does Humpty Dumpty waggle a dildo in the air and pretend that it's his penis? Why did my eyes have to see this? There are no words.,negative
Maybe if you smoked enough weed this would seem funny or would make you nostalgic for how completely unhinged people allowed themselves to be in the early 70's. There's an odd innocence to this movie and the sex is a lot more awkward and playful than the steely pros who do it for the cameras now.<br /><br />The real curio here - and really the only reason to watch this movie - is the appearance of Kristine Debell as Alice. She was a Ford model and it shows. She's got classic  WASP-ish good looks - like a really cute Ivy League sorority girl. So what the hell is she doing in this cheap  cheesy skin flick? From my vantage point she does not appear to be at all on drugs in this movie (which might explain it) and she actually seems incredibly committed to the part. When she sings her first song she really does act like she thinks she's flippin' Julie Andrews or something. I just get the feeling that this girl truly believed this was gonna be her big break or something  instead of the near career killer that it was. Anyway  she is damn cute and you kind of can't believe she would even get naked on screen  much less do a masturbation scene  a couple of oral sex scenes (with men and women) and then do the real deal as a climax to the film (snark). It is also definitely not a body double at all. That is our little Kristine taking one for the team  or for the greater glory of showbiz or something. It's pretty amazing to watch and it is definitely stimulating (ahem) but in a way I kinda wish she hadn't done it. That was a very pretty  talented young girl getting some really bad advice.<br /><br />Anyway  my guess is that Kristine Debell  wherever she is  has long  long since wished this movie would go away. She was very cute and appealing in Meatballs. Almost impossible to believe this is the same girl - but it is.,negative
"Oddly  I have very little to say about The Box so this will be pretty brief. I have never read the Richard Matheson novella Button, Button from which the film is based  but considering what I saw in this adaptation  there couldn't have been much semblance to such a legendary author's work. The Box is about a family who discover a strange contraption on their doorstep that has a button on it. Frank Langella shows up and explains how they will be given one million dollars if they push the button - the only 'catch' is that it will automatically kill someone  somewhere... ??SPOILER?? They push it ??END OF SPOILERS?? That whole concept was interesting on its own  but somehow they managed to extend the movie into some convoluted Stargate knock-off that pads it out until a pretty decent ending with a pretty profound message. While I'm trying to be as 'fair' as possible  I still must say that this was not my cup of tea and it bored me severely. I guess its from the same director as Donnie Darko which I remember liking when I saw it years ago. The Box would've worked well as a short film  but since it was so lifelessly adapted this way  I can't come close to recommending it...",negative
This is a flic that you can safely avoid. childish plot and poor acting from Cameron (she really shouldn't take on these serious roles - they don't suit her)Besides she looks most unglamorous  Lets face it  shes' great in Charlies Angels and She was superb in There's Something about Mary... The Pope wouldn't be a good President of the USA and vice versa  my point being that there are some actors/actresses who are suited to a particular type of character and Cameron is most unsuited for this serious housewife type - there are a dozen other actress' would have done a far better job. The movie itself is rather unbelievable and juvenile in its plot (did I spell Juvinile right??) I noticed a comment from another reviewer who has given The Box a 10 rating  who was derisive in his comments on other reviewers who gave the movie a 1 or 2 rating and couldn't spell. I mean whats spelling got to do with a movie review? Does he mean that persons who spell perfectly could appreciate this movie more that the ones who couldn't? C'mon 'professor.,negative
I found this movie really hard to sit through  my attention kept wandering off the tv. As far as romantic movies go..this one is the worst I've seen. Don't bother with it.,negative
The Box is a film with great potential  but the makers totally misused that potential. The film seemed to take for ever  because of the boring family dinners and scenes about school and job-dialogs between the action. Those scenes could and must be deleted in my opinion to keep up the tensity and thrill. The philosophy of human free will has potential and seems to referring to the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)  but we find ourselves regretfully struck with magic and nosebleeds  were even Harry Potter would flunked his class with!<br /><br />Probably the best part was that moment when Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz)has been shot to death  by her loving and caring husband as an act of human free will. I wonder how Hobbes would react if he could...,negative
How truly sad that this sprung from the same mind as Donnie Darko  possibly one of the best films in this genre. Where do I even begin? I think one of the must infuriating aspects of the film is that we are supposed to be critiquing humanity  and yet we see no humanity in the film. No more than 5 minutes of the film is spend agonizing about the possible death of another human. These are horrible one dimensional cardboard cutouts of human beings. Sadly  that's how they are played with what can only be described as dreadful acting. Is this truly how Kelly sees humanity? Judging from the reaction of viewers  this is a horrible encapsulation of humanity. Why don't the characters in the film ask the questions that all the viewers have? This is not an indictment of humanity. It's an indictment of the straw men that Kelly sets up who bare almost no resemblance to real humans in this situation.<br /><br />To those who say this was a wonderful thought-provoking film  to what are you comparing it? Armageddon? I even saw someone compare this to the works of Kurosawa. How truly deprived must you be to think that this would promote good existential discussion? For the love of all that's good in film! Even Indecent Proposal is ten times the indictment of humanity that this is. There we see people truly agonizing about greed and the human condition. Yes  even Indecent Proposal puts this film to shame for philosophical discussion and yet it gets 5.3 vs 6.0 for this mindless tripe.<br /><br />Rarely have I seen a more pretentious  pontificating  and self aggrandizing  film fall so flatly on its face. This has the depth of a high school film project  and a poor one at that. Truly  that's about the level of the discussion promoted by this film. If you want to see GOOD psychological film making  do yourself a favor and check out Das Experiment. If The Box had lived up even to this one goal  I would have been willing to forgive some of the atrocious acting  gaping plot holes  and sheer nonsensical storyline. Sadly  it can't even do that.<br /><br />The true indictment of humanity is that there are people out there who think this film is a deeply delving introspective look into the human condition. This is not Sartre! This is not even the Cliff Notes version of Sartre! This is a hastily conceived and hack-written 9th grade term paper on Sartre based on some internet message board ramblings. If Sartre were alive  he would sue Kelly for defamation.,negative
"First of all. Should Cameron Diaz ever be allowed to act again? To call that a bad performance would be an insult to bad performances. That was a historically horrific performance. Any small chance that Diaz had at being a serious actress is now completely done after that. Laughably horrible.<br /><br />Two  the movie was extremely boring  and not very thought provoking at all. I can sit around and ponder human nature without having to watch terrible actors  play out a terrible story.<br /><br />Third  there was not a single likable character  and even worse  it seemed like that was done by design. You were not supposed to like  or feel sympathy for any character. It was quite effective. I wanted them all to just die to be honest. Aliens included. Kid included. Everyone was just one big mope in this movie. Everyone literally just moped around  and they called it a movie. You could barely distinguish the zombie employees, with regular people  because they all seemed like zombies.<br /><br />Lastly  nothing really makes sense. From the characters reactions and emotions  to the literal story line  it all just seems random. This is just a really bad movie  disguised and couched as a thinking mans movie, which is meant to be confusing. Give me a break. A bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie was bad.",negative
Don't be greedy sums up the depth of this movie. All the rest of the baloney is big budget window dressing. The movie rotates through hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much. None of the potentially interesting plot tangents are developed yet the trite ones are hashed and rehashed to excess.<br /><br />The charm of DD  as others have pointed out  was in the schizophrenia device the humor woven into the fabric of the movie  and most importantly  the acting. There is enough wooden acting in The Box to attract a giant mound of martian termites.<br /><br />The biggest problem with suspending disbelief during this mess is the glaring question  why would a technologically superior power capable of taking over the government need to do any testing at all? Awful failure of a movie.,negative
Cameron Diaz  James Marsden  Frank Langella: that's an all-star power cast but The Box proves once again that it is not a guarantee for a solid movie. The premise sounds promising: a couple gets a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollar. The downside is that someone will die  a person they probably will not know. So What Do You Do ? This gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. After that  the story derails completely. Vague an uninspired plot lines about an alien conspiracy involving the NASA  nothing really is explained here. <br /><br />The Box is a disappointment  could have been so much better. But since it is based on an ultra short story  that explains the continuity errors.,negative
This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably first ever written review of a film I've done of my own accord - not for some class assignment. I think that fact alone says something about this movie... not a good thing! I am no seasoned journalist or critic (though I have seen my fair share of movies)  but I found this particular film so terribly painful to watch  it was necessary for my own peace of mind to vent about the experience. Where better to do it than IMDb? As I forced myself to sit through the movie  physically writhing from the inability to connect-the-dots  I was sure there would be some light at the end of the tunnel - a revelation to explain what in samhe.-.ll was going on. The movie ended and I was as enlightened as dog****. After several rewinds to review certain scenes I still could conclude nothing sensible. I found myself wanting to yell Does this make sense to anybody? I would recommend to not waste your time  but then again if I were you I'd probably want to experience it myself. If that's the case  bring a crossword puzzle or something so you don't get bored.,negative
quite possibly one of (if not the) worst film ever conceived  cast and acted in the history of cinema. Who on God's green earth would ever think to cast Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looked like his mother. God forgive me but I am just being honest. And that was the least of the many problems plaguing this horrible excuse for a film. It was a horrible statement against women but at least if you're gonna blame women for the problems of the world  tell a decent story not one with so many annoying loop holes and pathetic excuses for suspense and thrills. Everybody should get their money back who went to see it in theaters or bought the DVD.,negative
I like to like movies  but I found nothing to like about The Box. I was interested in the 'hook' of the plot  but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow. Anyone who states that they understand this movie is probably faking it so that they can feel like they are a part of something  well I have news for them  the emperor has no clothes.<br /><br />The only undertone in this movie is that women are to blame for original sin  and corrupting mankind. I've heard that story before  and it makes less and less sense every time. It's true that this movie is different than a lot of films currently showing in theatres  but that doesn't make it worth the ticket price.,negative
Now  this movie is the worst i have ever seen!! It is simply a disaster. I think it's really a sick movie  i just wasted my time watching this cheap crap. I can't believe anyone would produce such a disaster. Such a waste of money and time. Nothing to learn from this movie  it's just a hollow sick evil flick. I don't think they could've make it worse  this movie just earned it's title as the king of lowest crap. The acting is a disaster  the meaning...oh well there is no meaning just a sick pain and sorrow introduced by the suffering child in the end of the movie  and the killing of the wife which again was another dumb blow to this movie. Do yourself a favor  if you actually have some self respect  keep away from this awfulness!!!,negative
Couple having financial trouble gets a box delivered to their door. If they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. Do they push the button? <br /><br />This is an odd film based on a Richard Matheson short story has a few chills but mostly is a messy affair. The trouble is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director Richard Kelly didn't know what sort of movie he was making. Is this a straight out horror film with supernatural overtones? At times it seems like it with talk of moral choices  damnation and the afterlife. Is it a science fiction film? Possibly  there are lots of questions about that Mars project. And what are the strange looks that people seem to have as if in some grand conspiracy? Is this Invasion of the Body Snatchers or a demonic take over film? Don't know  maybe. And that's the problem there are lots of questions  most of them intriguing  but there are too many. Little seems to have been explained and when we get to the end of the film things seem more to stop then to conclude (even in an open ended way). I'm all for making a film rich with themes and points but writer Kelly fills his script with simply too many that director Kelly can't handle  or does so in such away that each theme or plot thread gets its ten minutes of screen time and for those minutes it hold court before its cast off the next bit. It made me crazy. (I won't get into the two leads  Cameron Diaz and James Marsden  who aren't very good or more likely don't know what to make of the material which is so ever shifting ) <br /><br />It's a heady mix that doesn't work (there are ultimately too many holes). I got to the end and suddenly realized I had no idea what I just saw. I really didn't like it  but its more in a this isn't good because it just misses sort of a way rather. I'd take a pass or wait for cable where its not going to cost you anything,negative
i thought id check this film out as I'm currently making a film about a mysterious box  therefore it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of a mysterious and unexpected box.<br /><br />before going to the cinema i had a high expectation of this film. with actresses  like Cameron diaz you would expect the acting especially hers to be great. the acting was a sort of let down for the film  the characters accents changed throughout the film it made it unbelievable.<br /><br />the whole idea of a weird box that can make your dreams come true but destroy others is such a brilliant story but i feel the director let it down  this film had potential it could of been a lot lot better than it was.<br /><br />this film had no middle to it. it was too confusing and needed a steady storyline. nobody wants to go into the cinema and come out thinking what have i just watched 'i didn't get it at all ' sometimes it can be exciting and make people want to watch it again  but this film made people want to never ever want to hear of the film again. throughout watching i noticed that half the audience had left before the ending. i feel every single person had been let down watching this film because of the high expectations and how slow parts of the film was.<br /><br />lets put the bad points to one side... i did like however the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. it was unexpected  it reminded me of a horror movie and the way it was put together made me imagine it and how devastating and scary it would of been to be in that position. the lighting and the effects made it look excellent  this scene looked slightly more 1990's than the 1970's that this film is supposed to be.<br /><br />this film was confusing because it had so many different bits to it. parts that you would expect to be sumned up at the end where everything comes clear but it didn't  it totally went against an audiences expectations  even though leaving the film on a cliff hanger  not giving the audience a reason why things happen could work and do really well  but this one didn't  it was a creative  different unusual film i thought  it had potential could of been better  disappointed didn't enjoy it  wouldn't buy it on DVD to be honest.,negative
No  no  no  no  no  no  NO! This is not a film  this is an excuse to show people dancing. This is just not good. Even the dancing is slow and not half as entertaining as the mediocre 'Dirty Dancing'  let alone any other good dance movie.<br /><br />Is it a love story? Is it a musical? Is it a drama? Is it a comedy? It's not that this movie is a bit of all  it's that this movie fails at everything it attempts to be. The film turns out to be even more meaningless as the film progresses.<br /><br />Acting is terrible from all sides  the screenplay is definitely trying to tell us something about relationship but fails miserably.<br /><br />WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When Patrick Stewart enters the scene and you think the film might get better as he brightens up the dull atmosphere. For a second.,negative
First time I ever felt I needed to write a review.<br /><br />I have seen thousands of movies in my life and I like a wide range of movies. I am reasonably opened minded  and can easily say I enjoyed a movie while still saying yeah it was not good but I enjoyed it. I can appreciate the mastery of great movies like The Shaw shank redemption  the godfather  and American history X. I can like good movies in a genre like horror  or comedy  even if the movie might not be that great. I can even enjoy a bad movie that just happens to entertain me (Bloodsport). I also will try to rate movie fairly even if I did not like it. City lights by Charlie Chapin was not a movie I enjoyed  but I can appreciate the acting and story lines for the time.<br /><br />I think some people when they go on this site instead of randomly click a rating  should take a few ideas into account. Try to rate the movie based on how good it actually was. Do not let your personal bias affect the rating. Also look at other moves you rated and compare the movie you are going to rate.<br /><br />This movie was the worst piece of trash I have ever seen. 2 hours of my life where just stolen. The acting was awful  across the board. The scenes where choppy at best. However the real disgrace was the story. The first 20 minutes we actually had a story that tried to make sense and take the viewer from point A to B. However after that it was a nightmare. They kept trying to add new elements but nothing was every explained. Nothing really ever made sense  was steward dead  is he alive  did he hit by lighting  was it really lighting  was it aliens  is he an alien  etc. The ending tied nothing together and really did not answer any questions. The only positive was nobody cared we where just happy to leave the theater.<br /><br />6.5/10??? What is wrong with some of you? I will admit that the 8 of us where so mad about seeing this  we did think what would make it better?  and we decide to tell a few of our friends that this movie was good so they would have to suffer and see this movie. What can I say misery loves company. That is really the only reason I can see for a 6.5 rating.<br /><br />Do not waste your life!,negative
"THE BOX (2009) * Cameron Diaz  James Marsden  Frank Langella  James Rebhorn  Holmes Osborne  Sam Oz Stone  Celia Weston. Truly disappointing adaptation of genre legend Richard Matheson's sci-fi chiller Button, Button by on the wane wunderkind filmmaker Richard Kelly who truly stretches a small  well-crafted piece into a grab-bag 'WTF'-a-thon! Mysterious (and ridiculously maimed!) man  Langella  posits a million dollar offer to 'struggling' couple Diaz and Marsden (both surprisingly vanilla bland to the hilt!): a box with a red-button  that when pushed  will kill some stranger in the world (!) Sure strings are attached but does that really matter here? What does is why in the name of God does Kelly trowel on so much oddness (i.e. nose-bleeds; watery transport systems  that's right  Watery.Transport.Systems) when the tension should be strung as tautly as possible (oh the possibilities). If this sounds like a bad TWILIGHT ZONE episode you are half right (the '80s TV re-boot actually did a decent small-screen adaptation; in fact rent that instead!) One of the year's worst films.",negative
Before you dismiss my post as not getting it  let me say...I'm one of the biggest Richard Kelly and The Twilight Zone fans out there. Donnie Darko is one my all-time favorites and I even thought Southland Tales had it's moments. I'm a HUGE sci-fi fan. I was very excited to see The Box  couldn't wait for it to come out.<br /><br />Having said that...The Box is terrible. Behind Drag Me To Hell  this was the worst movie I've seen in 2009. And it just simply WILL NOT end! Whenever you think you've reached the end  another change in the plot and you're off to more torture. I was actually groaning in the theater by the end of the film...I could hardly take it anymore.<br /><br />The biggest problem with The Box  no matter how you slice it or try to justify it  is that it simply makes little sense. Trust me  I got it  I understood what was going on. But that doesn't mean it makes a lot of sense looking back on it. Take the basics for example. The main couple...Cameron Diaz and James Marsden  playing Norma and Arthur Lewis. Diaz loses her finances at her job  then bemoans to her husband that they are living paycheck to paycheck. Well  sell that f-ing Porsche your husband is driving then!!! They live in a beautiful 2-story house in a nice subdivision. Marsden is working what seems to be a high-paid job at NASA and Diaz is an accomplished teacher. And  yes  Marsden drives an overly expensive car. But they are somehow living paycheck to paycheck?!? No need to press the button  just cut down your high-priced lifestyle a bit! The movie would have worked better if they showed the couple jobless and in serious debt. Instead  they are seemingly desperate for money...all the while living what I would call a luxurious lifestyle. Like I said...you can understand what's going on  yet it still makes little sense! That's a rare combination.<br /><br />There was an awful scene in a library that I feel will go down as one of the worst segments in movie history (terribly acted too by the way). It was idiotic  illogical and out of place. I can't even begin to fully describe it actually  so I will move onto a subplot that involves nose-bleeds and body possession by aliens. (Yes  I'm being serious unfortunately). A kid is in Diaz's class with a wicked and smile on his face (a sinister smile that seemingly goes by completely unnoticed by everyone in authority at the school). He starts asking Diaz personal questions  literally embarrassing her in front of her class. No punishment is given to the kid whatsoever...he didn't even get asked to stay after class for a talk! Then Diaz is at a party...and the same kid is one of the hired help...ironed shirt  apron and all! I don't know many alien-possessed kids (who appear to be in Junior High) that also moonlight as a bus-boy at parties sponsored by teachers and school officials...but we found one here! (See what I mean...you can understand it completely  but it still makes no sense...a rare combo!) Like many things in the movie  the kid comes and goes...no real explanation about him  no ending to his character. Moving on... A lady then approaches Diaz in a grocery store  telling her that experiments are being ran secretly and her family is one of the test subjects. Well...hmmm...if aliens possess the powers where they can take over a body remotely...and the aliens don't want to help Diaz...then who was taking over this lady's body and giving Diaz advice?! Again...The lady was trying to help Diaz...and the aliens weren't interested in helping Diaz...so who the hell was controlling her body?! Never explained. Never talked about again. No nothing!! It goes on and on and on like this for  what seemed to me like  2 weeks. It would not end! I wonder if this movie underwent a massive re-shoot at some point. It was poorly edited. Diaz's accent was there one minute  gone the next. Sub-plots began but never ended. The numerous push-backs of the release date obviously shows the problems the producers had with the finished product. It's truly a train-wreck.<br /><br />Pass on this one...there's no redeeming value in it whatsoever. 3 out of 10  just because I like Diaz and sci-fi! But it probably deserves a 1 out of 10.<br /><br />Thanks for reading! <br /><br />JD,negative
Ha ha. - oh no - what to say about this film? Yes - green eggs and ham makes more sense than this movie. Where does one start? A lot of the good stuff has already been said - so I won't divulge into the same territory. I believe you already have the movie summary - so I won't paraphrase the movie.<br /><br />First - let's start the with good.<br /><br />1). If you like psychological thrillers that make you think (as I do) the first 29 minutes of this film will be for you - this is one of those films that illustrates the question that you always talked about on long car drives when you were kids like (what if you had to chose one family member live  another to die  or  what if you had to die by drowning or fire) This movie is a great concept - bottom line.<br /><br />2) The wardrobe group did a fine job with bringing us back to the 70's. Realistically though  how difficult is that to accomplish? .....Okay  that's about all for the good. Let's talk about the bad.<br /><br />1). This movie feels like a 2 hour Twilight Zone episode. This could easily be 90 minutes. That might have made the movie tolerable.<br /><br />2). Do you remember in the movie From Dusk til Dawn?. The movie started out interesting  then halfway through the movie it just took a degrading turn? Yep - same thing here. I would venture to say that the writers started with a concept  then had no idea what to do with it. I've gotten deeper thought provocation out of Transformers 2.<br /><br />3). Yes - we get the dilemma in the film. We understand the philosophical undertones and Utilitarian approach - but the story jumped around way too much  didn't elaborate on the current story arc  and took a(forgive me)completely insulting direction.<br /><br />4). The ending didn't make sense. Not at all. None.<br /><br />This movie would make a great term paper in college philosophy 101. If you're board out of your mind  in bed sick  or have ever enjoyed being hit in the face with a pie  and can view this free on-line - by all means  go for it.<br /><br />If you need to pay anything to view this movie  don't waste your time - you're better off watching old Howie Mandel stand-up on You Tube. You will get more philosophical stimulation reorganizing your sock drawer.,negative
Be warned  the next time you see Richard Kelly involved in any production  run away. Fast.<br /><br />Kelly proved to the world after his last movie  Southland Tales  that he is one pretentious director. It was indulgent and convoluted. In The Box  not much has changed.<br /><br />I can picture what his pitch to Warner Bros must have been  and I bet the executives at the studio ate it right up: a full-feature film based on one of Richard Twilight Zone Matheson's old short stories.<br /><br />Big mistake! Do not read any further unless you want this movie COMPLETELY spoiled for you: <br /><br />Norma (Cameron Diaz) pushes the button. <br /><br />Turns out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien using his body as a vessel to conduct experiments in which the fate of mankind rests. His face is scarred because he was struck by Alien lightening  which killed him  but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing. Obviously since Norma pushes the button  knowing full well that someone may die  she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else's life instead of her own. In the end she and her husband (James Marsden) choose to kill Norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind.<br /><br />Kelly dances around his film's message  trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is. Obviously  any person with a brain is saying at the beginning  What if I was the person who dies?. Richard Kelly doesn't even let his character's have this normal  HUMAN conversation. In fact  they avoid it all together. They appear to both be educated  working at a prestigious school and also for NASA  so why wouldn't they both have a better ability to LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX???<br /><br />If he had the main characters actually have this conversation  the entire movie could have ended right there! Instead  we have to watch weddings go on forever  NASA and the NSA be complacent to Arlington Stewart taking over these government programs  teleportation to show Marsden life beyond our world so it will be easier to kill his wife  and drone's controlled by Steward which can be anywhere and nowhere  at any time.<br /><br />The most painful part of this movie is the pacing. Nothing really happens. Its a muddled mish-mash of ideas that are laughable.<br /><br />It is insufferable how this film is being marketed. The commercials make it look like Saw and even use the music from those films to sell it. In reality what you get is a slow  dull  laughable (yes  half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects)  and messy film which is neither imaginative  interesting  nor cohesive. At one point  Cameron Diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly  she is back in the NSA's big black car with her husband on the way home. Where did she go? Why did they take her? Do we really care? Not anymore you won't.<br /><br />By the end you really won't care what happens to any of the characters. You will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end. Go see anything else that's playing. Don't waste your time  or money.,negative
I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme  with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces. I find neither of these kind of reviews helpful  and so I do not give this film the awful review I am about to  lightly. The film is art-house science-fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot  but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved. I like films which challenge the viewer and I do not need to be spoon-fed a plot  and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow. No - the film is just terrible. As the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on Cameron Diaz's wooden acting and a faltering plot-line. Avoid.,negative
In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden). One night a box is placed on the doorstep of their home and the following morning they cut open the box to reveal a button device that must be opened with a key. By the late afternoon  a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If they don't press it  nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal. The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties. Arthur  who is currently working for NASA  fails to be accepted into a new job he applies for and Norma  who is a teacher  learns that her faculty funding is being cut.<br /><br />One's enjoyment for this bizarre sci-fi thriller  based on the short story Button Button by Richard Matheson  will be determined by how far they are willing to take this ludicrous premise. The opening of the film is particularly problematic in grounding itself in a sense of realism with the household. Richard Kelly's previous film Donnie Darko cleverly used the condition of schizophrenia to justify its excursion into paranormal activity and parallel universes. Without the dream-like state of that far superior film  The Box and the very thought of a device that can kill anyone in the world  is entirely implausible. That Norma would also accept someone into her house that has almost the same scarring as Two-Face from The Dark Knight and believe this offer  seems equally contrived.<br /><br />If this sounds unlikely so far  what follows is even more absurd  involving a conspiracy about someone who was struck by lightning  the possibility of alien life or some other Godly being influencing these situations. Scenes involving gateways opening up in public libraries  random nose bleeds and mindless drones stalking the Lewis family  become almost unintentionally comical in their absurdity. To a point  the film could be called intriguing purely to see where it is going. Kelly is occasionally clever in his ability to hold our attention through many of the films contrivances. In one scene Norma is teaching a class and then is asked by a strange boy about her foot. He taunts her about it as she is missing four of her toes. Later  at a rehearsal dinner for a wedding that Norma and Arthur are attending  this same student appears as a waiter and seems to be stalking them. Yet the eventual justification for these all of these oddities is wrapped up in a highly contrived sci-fi revelation that many will find implausible and difficult to swallow.<br /><br />What is most disappointing about the film is that once the button is pressed surprisingly early on  many of the moral implications that were initially promised are diminished for much of pictures duration. The ending  which won't be spoilt here  resurfaces these moral questions again in the hope of echoing that of a Greek tragedy. While the resemblances can be seen  by this point  given the unlikelihood of so much of the film and the uneven performances  there is little reason to care. Cameron Diaz's Southern accent might be unnecessary but it is surprisingly Langella who is the most disappointing in the film  with a very unsubtly written role  as the mysterious scarred man  who seems to be hiding a military base that would make Dr. Evil proud. It really is just a shadow of his towering performance in Frost/Nixon. There is not a lot for many of the other actors in the film to do; in particular both Norma and Arthur could not be regarded as characters but mouthpieces for Kelly's pastiche of ideas. Underdeveloped and brief conversations  such as where Norma sympathises with Arlington over their deformities and also when Norma and Arthur question whether they really know each other in case the button kills either of them  highlights this.<br /><br />Since 2001  Richard Kelly has failed to make a film that has lived up to the quality and the imagination of Donnie Darko. Though this film might be intriguing for a little while  it is too absurd and implausible to be fully enjoyed and it would certainly not warrant multiple viewings given the film's rather illogical revelations. Science fiction fans might be able to appreciate it somewhat more and draw their own conclusions  but what Kelly is really trying to say beneath the surface remains cryptic. The Box is one film this year that should have been shelved.,negative
"A box with a button provides a couple with the opportunity to be financially free  but the cost is the life of someone they've never met. This is a very tedious film to watch. Richard Kelly  who wrote and directed it  decided to make a film without any payoff. You are taken on a ride of slow build ups  one after the other with minor revelations at best. At certain moments  I thought to myself  this will have major significance at the end  but nothing does. The film just leaves one thinking  This story could have been told in 30 minutes, without all the stretched out nonsense. I will hope you avoid this god-awful film and maintain your sanity by doing so.",negative
"Set in 1976 for no apparent reason other than to keep the set dressers busy  'The Box' was directed by Richard Kelly ('Donnie Darko')  and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis  a young couple who are supposedly struggling financially even though they both have successful careers--she as a high school teacher  he as an optical specialist at NASA's Langley  Virginia  Research Center. They have one child  Walter (Sam Oz Stone).<br /><br />One day the Lewises find a parcel on their doorstep  containing a black box with a big red button. There is a note from a 'Mr. Steward' indicating that he will return at 5:00 PM to explain about the box.<br /><br />The mysterious Arlington Steward  played by Frank Langella  shows up at the appointed time  nattily attired in an elegant Savile Row suit. He is polite but businesslike  however his most noticeable feature is his face  half of which appears to have been blown off and improperly attended to. Langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie  however he is unfortunately upstaged by his own makeup  which resembles that of Harvey 'Two Face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart) from Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight.' It's like the elephant in the room: one can try to ignore it  but it's more than a little distracting.<br /><br />Steward explains that he will return in 24 hours to collect the button. If  during that time  they decide to unlock and push the button  he will give them $1 million cash. The only catch--and it's a big one--is that somewhere a stranger will die. It might be across town  it might be on another continent  however Steward assures them the victim will be someone unknown to them. As a show of good faith  he leaves them with a crisp $100 bill  theirs to keep whether they push the button or not.<br /><br />Arthur and Norma are skeptical  believing the whole thing to be a scam or an elaborate hoax  however it isn't long before they begin to wonder what would happen if they did push the button? Would they really get a million dollars? Would somebody really die? Weary of the speculation  Norma slaps the button. Nothing happens. However  their initial relief gives way to alarm when Steward shows up the next day with a briefcase full of cash. They decide to call the whole thing off  however Steward tells them it's too late. You've already pushed the button, he explains. As Steward's limo pulls away  Arthur notes the license number  which he later discovers is registered to the NSA (National Security Agency).<br /><br />At this point the film begins to veer deeply into unfollowable territory as the secondary characters start springing nosebleeds and flashing peace signs. Meanwhile  the town becomes invaded by pudgy  slack-jawed geeks in bad shirts who start following Arthur around like an advance scouting party for a race of zombie alien nerds. Arthur eventually becomes trapped by the menacing bookworms in the library (?)  where Steward's spinsterish wife shows up--whom we haven't seen till now--and informs Arthur that in order to get out of the library he must step into one of three vertical columns of cheesy-looking digital water effects. 'What happens if I choose the wrong one?'  Arthur asks  seeming far less baffled than he ought to be under the circumstances  and certainly far less baffled than the audience is by this time. 'Eternal damnation ' the spinster says ominously.<br /><br />Arthur steps into the middle column of digital liquid effects  and after a brief absence suddenly appears  still in his water cocoon  hovering over Norma's bed. When she wakes up and sees him  the water bubble bursts and Arthur tumbles onto the bed in a shower of water which  oddly enough  continues to drip from the overhead water pipes just out of camera range while a sodden Marsden and Diaz flop around on the bed.<br /><br />It's confusing  I know.<br /><br />We eventually learn that Steward was once the public relations officer for the NSA  until he was struck by a lightning bolt that destroyed part of his face. He was pronounced dead  but later came back to life  having been transformed into a sort of superman who now serves 'the ones who make the lightning ' and whose powers have enabled him to take over the CIA  the NSA  and NASA all by himself.<br /><br />And what is the point of all this nattering rubbish? Apparently  Steward's mission is to subject humans to a kind of biblical character test (e.g.  the 'Binding of Isaac')  to determine whether humanity is worth saving. If enough people pass the button test by refusing to push it  Steward's god-like overlords will spare the race. Unfortunately  those people who do push the button  such as Norma and Arthur  must be punished for their moral spinelessness  to which end they are subjected to a series of dreary 'Lady or the Tiger' ordeals that play out like one of those 'Saw movies ' except without the entertaining gore or the benefit of a coherent plot.<br /><br />'The Box' represents the sort of pointless mental masturbation that freshman philosophy students like to blather on about after a few beers. Richard Kelly's tedious exercise in existentialist pettifoggery eventually collapses under the weight of its own incomprehensibility; the tortured melange of insupportable ideas eventually congeals  as with the mixing together of too many colors  into a meandering gray goo of a film as insipid as one of those narcotizing in-flight movies the plot of which suffers no more or less from having been interrupted by a leisurely nap.<br /><br />There is a point in 'The Box' where Arthur  who is a technically-minded guy  becomes curious about how the button works. Opening up the unit  he is disappointed to find nothing inside.<br /><br />Having seen The Box  I know exactly how he feels.",negative
This must be the first movie I've rented and not seen to the end. Complete garbage! The acting  the plot  set and wardrobe looked like it came from a porno movie with a plot. Not even a B move.,negative
Without being really the worst science fiction film ever made  or the worst I have seen  'Time Under Fire' is still much under average. The premises and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad  it starts as a X-Files story  combining Bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel. Pretty soon elements of other genres (too many) mix together  but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a TV series. Soon  'Time Under Fire' quickly degenerates into a series of clichés  not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow. Acting is bad  and the rhetoric lines in the script do not help at all.,negative
Where do I begin? The story was so bad  it must have been written in a high school film club! The acting was so wooden I felt sorry for the actors! One actor even reminded me of what a deer must look like when staring into a car's headlights! Another actor has this constant look of being constipated! But it was the dialog that takes the cake! <br /><br />Our hero says to his captors - all holding submachine guns - if you lay a finger on a female prisoner you will be dead. Moments later  the strongest guard  built like a truck  and the only women prisoner go at it. When our fearless leader  who has this very annoying raspy gangster voice catches wind of this transgression  he calmly walks up to the guard  while machine guns are trained on him  and in a split-second snaps this giant guy's neck like he was breaking a tooth pick! He then gets back in line while all the villains with their machine guns do absolutely nothing  but essentially yell at him!<br /><br />I could go on and on! This movie is camp gem; and if you have any sense of humor  it's guaranteed to make you laugh so hard your eyes will tear!,negative
A sprawling  overambitious  plotless comedy that has no dramatic center. It was probably intended to have an epic vision and a surrealistic flair (at least in some episodes)  but the separate stories are never elevated into a meaningful whole  and the laughs are few and far between. Amusing ending  though. (*1/2),negative
Drab  dreary and a total waste of my time. The plot is incomprehensible (so don't think about it too much). The acting is odd and wooden - I would have sworn that they were all professional body builders trying their luck at acting  but that might be an insult to body builders. There are no interesting special effects to redeem this disaster  but lots of fires  explosions  a gratuitous sex scene  etc. The only thing that caught my attention was that it takes place after a war between the US and Iraq that somehow goes nuclear...hmmm. Is Roger Corman psychic? Let's hope that Iraq was just a lucky choice for Corman and that the rest of his scenario doesn't come true. <br /><br />,negative
who's responsible for these behind the scenes things? who are these actors? did they crawl out from beneath rocks? 'yuks  lots of yuks!' no. no yuks for me. only loathing and shame that i am a human being. i have to avert my eyes from the set  it's so embarrassing. in fact  i changed the channel.<br /><br />i've always had a problem with robin williams' non-stop 'i forgot my lithium today' rantings  but at least he's funny once in a blue moon. watching someone who isn't funny at all impersonating robin williams is like having each tooth in your head pulled slowly and sadistically  without novocaine  for all eternity.<br /><br />please stop making these absolutely horrifying TV movies. please.,negative
Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotypical role as a mountain man (probably the Ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite coon dog. However  the dog appears to be drowning when Hunnicutt jumps in after him. It becomes obvious pretty soon that despite Hunnicutt and his dog roaming about after leaving the water that they both died in the water--as no one responds when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his and the dog's death. Yet  oddly  Hunnicutt is REALLY slow on the uptake and it takes him a while to understand they are talking about him! I think this was actually done as padding  as there really wasn't enough material to fill the half hour time slot.<br /><br />Later  in the surprise twist  he comes upon Heaven--or at least his concept of the place. He's invited in  but since they won't allow dogs  he has other ideas! Overall  reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value! With no twists or irony  this episode is a bit dull--not Twilight Zone-y enough for my tastes.,negative
As a South African  living in South Africa again after a 32 year stay in the UK  I am sorry to say that this movie is a huge disappointment. The three main problems I had with the movie was a) why Swank and Ejiofor - an American and a Nigerian - to play the leads. This country is bursting with talent and has no need of imports... b) Gillian Slovo has been trading off her Struggle credentials for years now. She's a very mediocre writer and even her novel doesn't stand up the flaccid direction of Mr Hooper... and c) Hilary Swank again  such a great actor  as proved in Million Dollar Baby (but that's Eastwood too)  here dressed in the contemporary New York style whilst roaming freely around the poverty of the Karoo. Where was the consideration and sensitivity needed by the costumer and director? Yes  the film is ultimately moving - how could it not be? - but the overall mood at the conclusion is one of tremendous letdown. Heart's in the right place but needs a pace maker.,negative
Don't see this movie! It's... repulsive! The start is indeed very good  but in the middle everything falls and I really regret spending 80 crowns (about 11 dollars) on the ticket! Peter Dalle should consider this as his last chance to gain peoples interest. AWFUL picture! The only bright spot is the splendid work of Robert Gustavsson  Lena Nyman and Gösta Ekman.<br /><br />Hope you take my advise... The picture is rubbish.,negative
If I could give this movie a negative rating I would. The humor is the cruelest I have ever seen in a film. Horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. There are 2 plots  neither of which supports half of a film. Where is the depth others see in this movie? That no good deed goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done. The acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying. If you think that the 3 Stooges are too nice to each other  if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a Bowie knife is a real thigh slapper  if you thought Schindler's List was hilarious  then this movie is for you.,negative
Set in 1945  Skenbart follows a failed Swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to Berlin. Unfortunately for everyone around him  he's a walking disaster  causing mayhem everywhere he goes. The train also holds a man and his mistress scheming to murder the man's wife (who's also on the train)  a soldier on his way home  two gay elderly gentlemen  an angry train conductor  two nuns  a bunch of refugees  and even more people.<br /><br />Meant as a mix of noir-ish thriller (which it does quite well - at least to begin with)  and comedy  the film fails with both. It doesn't sit right as the film changes tone with every new scene. And as the train races towards its final destination  the film turns more and more bizarre  ending on a truly surreal note.<br /><br />The good bits are wasted in a myriad of pointless plots and characters. Skenbart is packed with famous Swedish actors  no matter how small the part is. It feels like the filmmakers rang everyone they've ever worked with and offered them a part in the film. Too bad that the performances are just as bad as the script (act your lines - don't read them!).<br /><br />The comedy is more or less slapstick  with the same jokes repeated over and over. The pace is incredibly slow at times (quite often  actually) with on scene in particular dragging on for about ten minutes for no good reason. The screenwriter also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue. The film looks great though  in moody B&W  but it's wasted on such inept film-making in every other department. [1/10],negative
Outside Sweden you are not expected have seen this movie. Happy you. The cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the Swedish movie history. And still.. <br /><br />Seems like Peter Dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is totally misused in this movie  trying to copy a younger Gösta Ekman. Ekman  by the way  is the only actor fulfilling the expectations. <br /><br />Credit that can be given is for the photo  splendid idea using black and white. Music is OK.<br /><br />But over-all it's a waste of god actors and the time of the audience.,negative
I had this movie given to me  and have to admit  I am glad that I did not pay money for it.<br /><br />The back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle  with 2 women trying to seduce her. But the reality in this movie is far from that.<br /><br />In reality  the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters. There was absolutely nothing in this that I found interesting at all.<br /><br />Even movies like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which the box tries to compare this movie to) were riveting  because of the unexpected turns and suspense.<br /><br />But Jaded has none of this. It concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them. And the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true.<br /><br />While it does show that same sex rape is possible  it is not a movie worth watching.<br /><br />If at all possible  pass this movie up at all costs.,negative
Okay  so it was never going to change the world  and it bombed at the box office  but Honky Tonk Freeway is one of those films I fell in love with as a child (the BBC showed it a few times during the 1980s and I happened to have a high quality VHS tape in the machine - lucky  that!) and watched endlessly. I watched the DVD last night and sadly  time has not been kind to this would-be blockbuster. Either that or I've just grown out of this kind of broad  dopey humour. Come on  when Schlesinger is so desperate for laughs he gives us close-ups of novelty underpants with 'amusing' slogans  what can you say about the cast or screenplay?<br /><br />Certainly  it's ambitious  interesting  unusual and sprawling  but it's never once laugh-out-loud funny. I'd describe it as a children's film with some 'adult' overtones - you can safely let your youngsters watch this  despite the 15 certificate. They won't get the drug references  so don't worry about it. I had a pleasant surprise when I realized I'd forgotten just how catchy both the title song and the song-writing truck driver's 'Everybody's Going Faster  Faster' song were  not to mention the town of Ticlaw's patriotic anthem. The whole cast give commendable performances  the photography is crisp and captures the mood of the various locations perfectly  and there's a real time capsule feeling about the fashions  the cars  the gadgets (especially the dashboard-mounted drum machine)  the interiors and the pop-culture references - I was more than a little surprised to hear the nutty bum in the bank loudly telling everyone I'm OJ Simpson!  particularly now Simpson's legal tangles have overshadowed his sporting achievements. The snag is  there's almost no plot to speak of  it's way too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to elicit many genuine laughs. I wish I'd left this one as a pleasant memory.,negative
Jaded offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and ask the question when is rape not rape?. Unfortunately the flick seems to suffer from bad direction as it slogs through legal minutia while trying to weave some kind of story with a handful of foul mouthed and poorly portrayed characters only to end abruptly. Jaded is lame stuff only for the bleary-eyed couch potato in the mood for some dark drama.,negative
Hard to imagine what they were thinking of when they made this movie (i.e.  the writers  directors  producers  actors  editors  etc.). Christopher Plummer  veteran of 129 movies  frolics along among scores of other actors with apparently no more motivation than to collect a paycheck. I guess there is nothing wrong with that  but once they are paid that doesn't mean anyone has to watch it.<br /><br />It bugs me that there are actually good reviews for this movie here at imdb. Art? If you want to see art go to an art gallery  don't watch this movie. Comedy? Watch a re-run of the Flintstones  about the same plot with less time wasted.<br /><br />Dabney Coleman gives his usual performance  for better or worse. And some of the young actors may have gotten some good experience from doing this movie. But Plummer???? It was embarrassing to watch his performance  in fact I was positively transfixed on him throughout the movie  knowing this was Plummer of Sound of Music fame! I see from his bio that he called Sound of Music sound of mucus  so guess he didn't like it as much as the 100's of millions who liked him in it.<br /><br />I wonder if today he was asked  how do you rate Sound of Music compared to Where the Heart Is  what would he say.....?<br /><br />Probably something like Where the Money Is....,negative
I'm a Boorman fan  but this is arguably his least successful film. Comedy has never been his strong suit  and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done. Still  it's almost worth seeing for Boorman's eye for talent: this is one of Uma Thurman's first starring roles  and as always she is ravishing to watch. (On a sad side note  Boorman wrote the script with his daughter  Telsche  who died a couple years ago.),negative
I say this. If you want to see art  you go to an art gallery. If you want to see a movie  you go to a theater. Trying to intertwine art and film proves disastrous in Where the Heart Is. An interesting cast is totally wasted in this embarrassment. You like Dabney Coleman  see Short Time. You like Crispin Glover  see Bartleby. You like Uma Thurman  see Kill Bill. Above all  if you like Christopher Plummer  see The Silent Partner  because his character here  is a terrible embarrassment. In fact this entire production is an embarrassment. Sure the human artwork is intriguing for a few minutes  so make a short  but do not subject an audience to pointless nonsense  masquerading as filmed entertainment. - MERK,negative
After seeing this piece of crap you will know why the limeys drive on the left side of the street...this movie is an absolute NO-BRAINER! The jokes (if this is the right word for it...) are mostly sub-standard (about 98%) and do miss any punch-line at all. Save the money and get drunk. You might enjoy this movie being totally wasted  perhaps!,negative
it really is terrible  from start to finish you'll sit and watch this ridiculous idiot  thinking hes cool when he's really not  rubbish plot line  terrible acting and complete waste of time and money  do NOT bother.,negative
I like Ali G's show  I believe the guy has comedic instinct  but hasn't (yet) developed it to a talent.<br /><br />The movie is a little worse than I was expecting. I don't find Ali-G offensive  just stupid. Jokes for 5-year olds  some good  some terrible.<br /><br />If you want to watch a movie that seems offensive  but is actually funny  see Tom Green's 'Freddy Got Fingered'.<br /><br />2/10,negative
I had already heard of Ali G in Madonna's music video Music. I always think he's funny. (In fact  he really is.) Just last year I always thought of buying a VCD of Ali G Indahouse. That's why some months later  I bought it cheap and I started watching it.<br /><br />But the movie surprised me. My older brother and I were expecting it to be a great laugh-out comedy. It turns out that Indahouse is just a stupid piece of garbage. It was really really bad. It also contains explicit sexuality content and very crude humor. It also didn't made me laugh  even just a big smile. We definitely hate that movie. Oh by the way  I have plans to sell it.<br /><br />Ali G was really different in his movie compared to his TV shows-- in such a negative way. Maybe he wasn't really well-focused and enough serious to make this flick. Just because there's some sex scenes in it doesn't mean it's freaking hilarious (because sometimes  too much isn't that laughable anymore). For the first time ever  I was disappointed at him. That really made me sad rather and happy.<br /><br />I gave this movie 1 over 10. Actually  I really want to give it a 0 rating. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my entire life. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wanna watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or horrible.,negative
Don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny. It was a complete disaster  and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Ali G is only funny on Channel 4's Ali G Show. After watching his performance  all i can say is He is not made for Movies. With a Daft script  or more like no storyline  there's nothing to keep you entertained. Full of annoying  unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way. At the end of the film  Ali G gives a speech. He mentions  if you hated this film  tell people it was good. Not even the speech could save the movie  He probably knew its gonna be a stinker. I would of given this a 0/10  but the minimum start is 1. Overall  Don't even waste your time on this rubbish.,negative
Bean  Kevin & Perry  UK TV creations that have made successful transitions onto the BIG screen. Now its Ali G's turn and I m afraid to say this is not one of them!<br /><br />Ali has always been obscene but funny with it. This film was extremley sick and not funny at all. Scenes involving bestiality  gay sex and paedophilia should not be portrayed for entertainment's sake.<br /><br />Ali G In Da House is rubbish and deserves making very little money.<br /><br />1 out 10,negative
STMD! is not a terrible movie  but it IS quite forgettable. The lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest  so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain. Special effects are imaginative  but obvious. The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there  of course  along with the archetypical teenagers  but the whole movie just doesn't gel. What was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor.<br /><br />I can't really recommend that you use your time watching this movie. I often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor  but these are sadly lacking in this film.,negative
If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen  Borat and Ali G then Ali G is immeasurably better. I'ts no master piece  but it's a film at least. Borat is complete garbage and I do not understand how it rated better then Ali G.<br /><br />I cannot put my finger on it  there something wrong with the Ali G script: half of the jokes are as if written by a 15 years old  not by an adult scriptwriter. And a number of jokes including Mr Cohen's lower body are quite tasteless. <br /><br />But the film actually comes together as a comedy and there are some valid jokes too that are funny: such as how Ali G becomes a member of government for doing something scandalous and stupid in the public (sadly true in today's western society: people get careers for doing stupid things in public)  also Ali's advice about immigrant policy and some others. <br /><br />Ali G overall remains a sympathetic character  even though a kind of mentally underdeveloped for his age. But it's OK to watch it's quite funny.<br /><br />But never ever watch Borat  it's awful and makes every intelligent movielover sick.,negative
My god how bad this is. Who is this impostor pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. It replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour.<br /><br />This was obviously an attempt to get him known in the States before he released his show there on HBO.<br /><br />One commentator here pleads that we not judge the movie on the merits of the show due to the difference in the mediums. While it is true that the standard format of the show could never have been transferred to the big screen Mr Sacha Baron Cohen could have ensured the smart use of his comic style in a more conventional movie storyline. Instead we have this mess  which in all honesty has nothing at all to do with Ali G except for the packaging.<br /><br />Terribly disappointing. Go seek out the DVD's of Innit  Aiiii  or Bling Bling for some real Ali G.,negative
Ali G was funny at first. His interviews were fresh and original. The idea of a mock gangster wearing OTT clothes and using street wise lingo was appealing at first.<br /><br />But this film is just a rehash of old jokes  the humour was mainly childish and revolved around the male sex organ for the most part. The film claimed good actors like Charles Dance  but their talents were wasted as they played silly 2-d characters. It is not 'terrible' but isn't really funny at all a second time. It could be said that the movie was Ali G's last bastion of comedy. After that he ran out of steam.,negative
I have absolutely no idea why I watched Ali G Indahouse except for the fact that Salon seemed to think a crime was committed by not nominating Sacha Baron Cohen for a Emmy for his work on Da Ali G Show. It is a sure bet that I will never watch that show as there was absolutely nothing funny about the movie. Comedy? Torture was more like it. It was just about the stupidest thing I every watched. I will admit that I was captivated by Rhona Mitra. I had not seen her in anything. She wasn't on The Practice during the time I was watching  so I guess I will have to check out Boston Legal one of these evenings to see how she does in something that may be worth watching.,negative
MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS For about the last four years I've been a keen fan of Ali G. Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent guy and  in my view  his best creation is Borat who's as funny as Hell and quite shameless in what he does and says to people.<br /><br />Anyway  to the movie. I didn't bother paying money to see this in the cinema; I suppose because I didn't expect a lot but when I hired the DVD recently  I found the whole thing pretty sad. The best part of Ali's taking the mickey out of others was largely missing and the script an plot was pretty damned awful; hooking all the car batteries together to blow a safe - REALLY!!?? <br /><br />This movie goes to show I think that some things can run for too long and definitely don't translate to the big screen. The movie also had that syrupy sweet ending that I've come to expect from British films. Where have all the good British movie making ideals gone to? That said  there were the odd very funny moments such as the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with HM the Q with the Shaven haven - RESPECT remark.<br /><br />So  in summary  I am an Ali G and Borat fan and I have enjoyed many of his interviews (notably the one with Anita Roddick of the Body Shop) but this movie fell really flat with me. If there's to be another movie  I hope it's a whole lot better than this lot of old tripe.<br /><br />Weasel100 <br /><br />Canberra  Australia,negative
When I went to see this film  let's not say that I had high expectations. But merely that I had a faint hope that this full length feature would have at least some of the hilarity and wit of TV's Da Ali G Show.<br /><br />But as one might expect  this cannot translate from a half hour TV show to a 90 minute film. The movie had no appeal what so ever  and resorted entirely to toilet and juvenile sexual humour. Basicaly  I should have ditched it halfway through but was silly enough to think it might somehow improve by the end  how wrong I was. I loved the show but hated the movie. This movie is only for those who find fellatio by canines amusing...,negative
I'm not a big fan of musicals  although this technically might not qualify as a musical. But I thought I would give it a chance as I love war movies. It was mediocre at best.<br /><br />Hudson seems totally out of kilter in this role. It just didn't work for me. Julie Andrews probably played her part as best as she could  but I just find it hard to buy her as a conniving  deceptive spy. Sorry  I know that is classic stereotyping on my part. But I have to say I think this is Julie at her most beautiful and feminine looking. I always thought of her as more matronly  but then surely that's a result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. No doubt they were desperately trying to get her out of that typecasting in this role. She was quite beguiling in appearance here  but I still didn't buy her as a spy.<br /><br />I couldn't keep my focus through the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and having conversations with those in my room (which I usually never do - I'm always shushing everybody). So that tells you how little it held my attention. Don't waste your time!,negative
Even before this film it is clear to see that Ali G has become the exact character he set out to parody. I am not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen's character anyway but was curious to see how a man of so little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund a near 1 and a half hour feature film out of a 3 minute joke. <br /><br />A paper-thin plot is just a torrent of penis and marijuana jokes and I must admit I did cringe when I saw such respected thespians as Charles Dance and Michael Gambon stoop so low for employment. Saying that I must admit (even if I am quite ashamed to) that I did raise a titter on more than one occasion  and however bad this film was it was never boring  and never once did I consider switching it off (mainly due to the gorgeous Rhona Mitra). Saying that  only watch this film if you are a teenage lad aged between 14 to 17 and you find dick jokes hilarious.,negative
First off  let me say I wasted Halloween movie night by watching this garbage. Second  let me inform you that the current DVD available by Shriek Show is not uncut  so you gore hounds will be very upset. Third  that one scene is the highlight of the film and since it's been cut  well  you see where I'm going.<br /><br />I know a lot of horror fans dig this movie. It is atmospheric  shot in the woods with some very nice scenery  waterfalls and such. But after the opening kill  which has a very brutal shot of a machete being jammed through a hunter's crotch  you get no real brutal kills after that. And  with a slasher movie  you sort of want that. At least  I do. The director and co. do nothing new with the killer in the woods idea  several of this type of movie were all made right around the same time in the very early eighties. The only thing this has going for it is that you don't hate the actors as much as you might in other films. They are sort of likable. The kids have a reason for being there: one of them owns a deed to some property on the mountain. But what is not explained is why his family has property there. There is no cabin or house  so why buy property in East Jesus  especially if you aren't a hunter or whatnot? Well  I'm sure some people do buy land for camping purposes  but that just seems unusual. Anyway  two squealing backwoods inbreds show up and start stalking the campers and picking them off one by one. And  as I said before  you get pretty much nothing in the way of decent deaths after the machete kill in the beginning. The ending has a sort of off the wall kill by Connie  but even that isn't enough to save this from being almost equal with the completely forgettable film  The Forest  which is mind-numbing.<br /><br />If Shriek Show had been able to get a real uncut print  then this review might have been a little more forgiving  but this is the day and age of uncut/unrated DVD releases of old obscure films for cine-hounds like me. When you slight us  you get the crud review. Sadly  the presence of the great fatherly George Kennedy is the only highlight of this movie to set it apart from the other garden variety trash that was churned out back in the day.,negative
Now I understand that this took two months to shoot. Really? I'm pretty certain my crew could do it in less than a week. This movie sucked so bad I couldn't even pay close attention. Just more proof that boob bearing women can't always save you from horrible writing  acting and direction. Now I understand it was a no budget endeavor  but there is also no continuity and no real reason to not to turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign news in a language you don't understand. Oh  there are a few decent looking females showing the goods. Still  there aren't enough sexy women alive to warrant watching this travesty perpetrated on the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. I trooped it out though with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you may want to use it after this hack job. Lastly  the individual (moron) who left a comment before mine thought this was a great movie and LOVED it. Just more proof that siblings shouldn't pro-create. Ow  BURN!!! - Captain J,negative
OK  yes I know I'm a Philistine  and I have no knowledge of  nor love for opera. I readily admit that I might feel differently about this film if I did. But I don't. So  for those of you like me  skip this one unless you want to look at the pretty (sometimes unclothed) girls. For what it's worth  I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (who I didn't recognize) was the best of the lot.,negative
This is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on TV for far far too long. Everything gets tired and the jokes start getting repeated over and over again. OK  from the start  the first couple of series were quite good. You had an Entertainment Manager (Simon Cadel) being pursued by his deputy played by Ruth Madoc  a cleaning lady wanting to become a yellow coat  an alcoholic child-hating Punch and Judy man  a bent Jockey  and a stand up comedian. As said earlier  it started well but went on way too long. Once Simon Cadel left it went downhill fast  you were getting dire story lines  and a new entertainments manager who Ruth Madoc (again) threw herself at. When a comedy is all filmed in one place there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be cracked. Unfortunately this went on so long every joke was cracked 3 or 4 times over. If this comedy had been stopped after 2 series it would have gone down as an all time classic. As it is  it will be largely remembered for the dreadful last few series.,negative
Unlike the other spaghetti Westerns  this one has characters that almost make sense  and can be identified to some degree. It still has the goofy gunplay of other spaghettis Westerns. A spaghetti  by the way  is another word for a Western with no plot  no characters you can care about  and goofy gunplay that doesn't make a bit of sense for the era  and relying on great music to make audiences feel something. This one is more lighthearted  like the ones that Bud Spencer and Terence Hill made together. They  too  were superior to the junk made by Eastwood and others  which sado-masochists make their friends watch  if they get a chance. It looks like everyone had a lot of fun making the movie  too. It was good to see a giant actor like Gilbert Roland  who wasn't even mentioned on the movie rental box  yet who was clearly the biggest name. His character was very enjoyable. There is a three way standoff at the end  which is much superior to the one it spoofs (The Good the Bad and the Ugly)  simply because the characters are at least a bit likable and a bit identifiable. Not a good movie  but has a bit of fun to it.,negative
"ANY GUN CAN PLAY (2 outta 5 stars) Totally routine spaghetti western starring that guy who used to play Kookie on 77 Sunset Strip. The plot is some convoluted nonsense about some stolen gold coins and various gunmen of dubious motivation trying to track it down. This is one of those lighthearted westerns... which means lots of labored attempts at comedy... and some really atrocious music during most of the action sequences (you can tell this isn't Ennio Morricone's work). George Hilton plays a bounty hunter called Stranger... but he doesn't leave much of an impression... he just doesn't have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero  who are able to do a lot with a sparsely-written character. The ending is a complete homage/parody of the ending of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly... though it's barely amusing enough to be considered a parody. The highlight of the movie is the first 5 minutes... which features actors patterned after Clint Eastwood  Lee Van Cleef and someone else (Is he supposed to be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? It's not very clear...) who are confronted by Stranger. It's an amusing in-joke for fans of Sergio Leone fans and spaghetti western aficionados... but I imagine no one else would see the point.",negative
Undoubtedly  the least among the Spaghetti Westerns I've been watching lately: basically a low-brow rip-off of Leone's THE GOOD  THE BAD AND THE UGLY (1966) with three disparate characters outwitting one another (and occasionally forming shaky alliances) in their search for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin rated it a BOMB; while it's harmless enough  it's also totally routine and  fatally  the three main roles are stereotypes  that is to say  uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee with ideas regarding his consignment being transported by train; Gilbert Roland is the legendary but ageing Mexican bandit (his frequent lapses into Spanish when excited are quite corny!) who  apparently  is still irresistible to women; George Hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter tries too hard to emulate Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name figure. Director Castellari - whom I saw at the Italian B-movie retrospective held during the 2004 Venice Film Festival  where he came off as the most pompous of the cult movie directors present! - shows little genuine feeling for the Western (on the strength of two above-average Franco Nero efforts in the genre  I ordered his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976]...I'm keeping my fingers crossed now!) and the film's tongue-in-cheek approach is equally lamentable.,negative
The film begins with a dandy gunfight  where three bandits are quickly gunned down by a bounty hunter--a bounty hunter who bears more than just a superficial to the Man With No Name from the Clint Eastwood trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS  FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE and THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY).<br /><br />Immediately after  you see this man in a gold train filled with Union soldiers. Naturally  the shipment is attacked and the soldiers all fight like blind guys  so they are quickly neutralized. However  in a twist  one of the bandits cheats the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and rides away with the gold. Soon  Roland catches up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden. But  just at that moment  the army turns up and kills the traitor....bummer. However  the Man With No Name wannabe thinks Roland knows about the treasure and perhaps a medallion given to Roland by the traitor holds the key. A strange banker  also is thrown into the mix. All three want the gold and all three seem pretty macho.<br /><br />Overall  this is not a particularly distinguished Western. Much of it is the plot  some of it is that George Hilton (a Uruguayan despite the American sounding name) isn't as interesting as Eastwood or some of the other premier Spaghetti Western stars but most of it is because the soundtrack simply sucks. So often the music doesn't even come close to matching the acting and it seems almost randomly added. Plus  it just isn't very good stuff as well. This clearly isn't the work of Ennio Morricone--music master of the Spaghetti genre.<br /><br />Overall  just a time passer--and not a particularly good one to boot.,negative
Lately  I've been watching a lot of westerns from the 1930s to the present. There are some great low budget spaghetti westerns from the late 1960s and early 1970s. This movie had all the elements of a decent western: a good story with talented actors and everything else. Although  it's a spoof of this genre  and for me the way it was done just didn't work and made for a disappointing movie.<br /><br />This movie can easily be divided into two parts.<br /><br />The first part is great; it has a great opening scene and an interesting story develops of a bounty hunter (a.k.a. the stranger) going after a bandit who is going after a large bank shipment guarded  in part  by a banker. Over the course of the movie these three characters form shifting alliances in an attempt to get the money. There are subtle comic nods to the contrivances of earlier films from this genre  but the comedy doesn't disrupt the overall story.<br /><br />The second half of the film is where the comedy goes over-the-top and essentially ruins the movie. The turning point is right at the part where the barmaid causally scolds the dwarf to stop shooting the customers as she goes about waiting on other patrons seemingly oblivious to the four dead bodies laying about the place. From this point onward the movie shifts from a decent spaghetti western with comic undertones to a stupid-silly spoof.<br /><br />There are three horrible fist-fight scenes (one at the river  one in the market and one at the baths) that follow in rapid succession as if one wasn't bad enough. The fighting is so fake it's ridiculous  and since the sound is out-of-sync with the picture it makes it even worse. In the market fight scene the banker bounces about the place on hidden trampolines and twirls around on poles like he is in the circus; it's clownish. Although  the worst part of these fight scenes is the music; it's this light-hearted  sprightly mix more suited for a square dance or a cheesy episode of 'Hee-Haw'. These scenes practically derail the main story.<br /><br />Overall  this movie was disappointing because it had a lot of potential as a decent western  but the comic turns just mucked it up. If you want to see a good western spoof then see 'Blazing Saddles'. If you want to see a good spaghetti western  then avoid this movie.,negative
There's considerable amount of money behind this production  so the look of it is very good. It includes some interesting appearances by Gilbert Roland  Eddie Burns  and a brief cameo at the beginning by Christopher Lee. There are a few exciting gunfights  and a humorous bit or two - the satire on Django  the Man with No Name  and Sabata is amusing  especially when they are given the names of failed presidents of the Mexico revolution.<br /><br />The trouble is  there isn't any purpose in satirizing the Spaghetti Western as is attempted here. The key element in the Spaghettis is IRONY  which easily blends into comedy; in fact the source of all Spaghetti's is Kurosawa's Yojimbo  which is universally recognized as one of the great black comedies of all time  and most Spaghettis easily slipped over the edge into real comedy of a very sophisticated variety. Perhaps the best evidence of this is found in the Trinity films  which are both openly Spaghettis and openly slap-stick comedy. So why bother satirizing a genre that - by its very nature - satirizes itself? Consequently  I found the whole enterprise essentially unconvincing. None of these characters were people I would ever care about  the story was generically cliché  and the production values only reflected the money involved  not the passion of the director. Over all  a banal and futile effort to cash in on the phenomenon it mocks.,negative
I honestly don't know where to begin when reviewing a movie as pathetic as Ernest Goes to Africa. Aside from two or three good laughs dispersed throughout the film  there is nothing positive about this hour-and-a-half waste of time and life. It is incredible that someone was able to round up a group of people willing to act  film  and edit this piece of trash  and even more incredible that this is the eighth installment in the Ernest series.<br /><br />During the opening credits of the movie  we see Ernest posing next to various African objects  such as wooden masks and the heads of African animals  making faces and gestures that would probably make most 3rd graders laugh. This opening scene gives the viewer a taste of Ernest's frequent attempts at humor  and demonstrates how his comedy falls flat 95% of the time.<br /><br />The first thing that really hit me about this movie is how bad the acting is. Everyone in the film is a typical C-movie actor  but Linda Kash stands out as especially terrible. She is the epitome of overacting; all of her lines are delivered with shockingly inhuman enthusiasm that you'd find only in a middle school play. Most high school theater students probably could have replaced these actors and delivered a more powerful performance. Jim Varney at least displays some comedic ability every now and then  but for the majority of the movie he just acts like a complete retard  trying to be humorous by making stupid faces and speaking in different voices.<br /><br />Ernest Goes to Africa begins in Africa  where an archaeologist has stolen two priceless gems from an African tribe. The gems then make their way back to the United States  where an unidentified man is seen running from several henchmen through a flea market. He hides them in a bucket of two for a dollar items  and then runs from the scene. Ernest is looking for a gift to buy for Rene  a waitress he likes  so he goes to the flea market and of course buys the priceless gems. He later takes them back to his house  paints them  and glues them together to make a yo-yo. He gives the yo-yo to Rene and she explains that they can never be together because he is just an average shmoe  and she wants a man of adventure. Rene and Ernest are tracked down by the henchmen  and are then brought to Africa to be kept as prisoners.<br /><br />Most of the movie really doesn't make sense. Once Ernest is in Africa  he falls out of the truck that they are carrying him in and lands in a river. In the next scene  we see him as a Hindu servant named Hey You. His skin is dark and he is wearing a loin cloth. At first  I thought Jim Varney was playing another role in the film in addition to Ernest  but I immediately recognized Ernest's idiocy once Hey You began to speak.<br /><br />Another scene that sticks out in my mind as being completely ridiculous is the car chase scene in the African wilderness. Rene and Ernest have taken an ostrich farmer's truck and are being chased by the henchmen. Driving at about twenty miles per hour on a fairly straight road  both henchmen are shooting at Ernest  who is in the back of the ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest  on the other hand  is throwing ostrich eggs at the henchmen and their driver. The henchmen never hit Ernest once during the five minute chase  but Ernest is able to fend them off by hitting them and their driver in the face  making their car swerve off the road and explode in a giant column of smoke. I should also add that Ernest is slingshotting the eggs  two at a time  from a large bra.<br /><br />The set design is also incredibly poor in this movie. There is a large portion of the film in which Rene and Ernest are walking in Africa  trying to find civilization. During their hike  we see them walking through fields and jungles  which probably could have been shot anywhere in the United States. The fields are simply plain grassy fields  with no indication whatsoever of being anywhere near Africa (they could have at least digitally added some African trees in the background)  and the jungles look like the woods of rural Connecticut with papier mâchè skulls  vines  and thorns hanging from trees. According to IMDb.com  the film was actually shot in South Africa  but I still wouldn't believe that at all.<br /><br />The movie goes on and on  Ernest joke after Ernest joke. The rest of the movie doesn't really make any sense either; the African tribesmen all speak English for some reason  and Ernest is later challenged to a Battle of Truth by the lead henchman  who is suddenly dressed in an outfit that resembles that of a ninja  yet also somewhat resembles that of a bondage submissive. The henchman has a table of axes  swords  knives  and maces before him  while Ernest has a table with a sandwich  a teddy bear  and a few other worthless items. However  Ernest wins the battle and somehow ends up saving the day.<br /><br />Overall  this movie is painful to watch. I couldn't handle it in one sitting; I had to stop halfway through and do something productive for a few hours to compensate for the brain cells lost while trying to appreciate Varney's humor. They should really put a Surgeon's General Warning on the box to let people know that they will in fact be slightly more retarded upon finishing this movie. I would have to say that out of all the movies I have ever seen  none comes close to being as pitiable as Ernest Goes to Africa.,negative
OK  so one night me and some friends decided to get really stoned and watch a movie. Unfortunately for us  we chose 'Ernest Goes to Africa.' I have never laughed so hard in my entire life. This movie is beyond bad. I have literally pooped out better films than 'Ernest Goes to Africa.' (I poop films) <br /><br />The highlight of this movie  for me at least  was the opening sequence  when Ernest is making silly faces. When they showed him with a head the size of a peanut  I lost it. Perhaps I found this so funny because at that point I was the most high. Perhaps you are right.<br /><br />If I had to guess what George W. Bush's favorite movie is  I would guess 'Ernest Goes to Africa.' Never before have I seen a movie rely more on 1950's stereotypes of people of color. There were times when words escaped me and I just stared in awe.<br /><br />As I was watching this  I couldn't help but wonder  is this movie meant for children? Do literate adults actually watch this? How could there possibly be a whole franchise of 'Ernest' movies? Is this really my life? Is this real? <br /><br />I hated this movie.,negative
Having first read the novel  I don't mind for the purposes of filming  how differently it is scripted  as long as it adheres to  or at least includes  the plot. For reasons known only to Hollywood  important parts of the story are completely ignored  and a different story line added. The reason this novel passed the test of time  is  no doubt  due to the interweaving of both the characters  and plot  as a whole. To interfere with this structure  is to destroy the intricate balance of the story line  and therefore the intension of the story teller. Although a matter of opinion  the casting of this film leaves a lot to be desired. Characters  described as very fat  should  at least  be made to look portly  to allow for the character to have credibility. The days of slavery can't be over  or surely  actors of this calibre would have been in revolt  at such a travesty of the story. The face of Marian Halcolme is described as being manly in appearance ... Tara Fitzgerald's very feminine appearance doesn't ring true. Again Laura Fairly is described as being 'fair'  if not 'ethereal'  so  with dark hair  she does not quite fit the impression gleaned from the novel. ....Badly done  Hollywood!<br /><br />J. Hunter,negative
This is supposed to be based on Wilkie Collins' _The_Woman_In_White_  but the only resemblance it bore to that story were the characters' names  the time period  and the settings. If they were going to change the story so thoroughly  I don't understand why they needed to keep up the pretense that it came from Wilkie Collins. Go read the book. It's much better.,negative
Seeing the title of this movie Stupid Teenagers Must Die made me believe this was a spoof of some kind. I discovered later on the original title was Blood and Guts. Both titles are misleading  though. This is not a spoof  neither a serious splatter movie. This is something in between  failing in both areas. A group of teenagers is attending a séance at a spooky house and then the killing starts. Sounds over familiar  doesn't it. Well  this movies adds nothing whatsoever to the endless stream of similar movies. And it is badly made. Because of the lack of light the entire film is grainy. Now this effect can be highly effective  but it isn't in this case. The young cast isn't acting too badly  but the director has no clue as what to do with actors. In numerous scenes the actors are clearly waiting for directions  but these are given too late. It could also be an editor's mistake  of course. The characters are unrealistic and the story line just stinks. The sound is terrible at times: conversations are undecipherable  but when talking loudly or screaming the actors are very loud indeed.<br /><br />This is not the worst horror movie I have ever seen  but it still is a bad one. For me a 3 out of 10.,negative
An awful travesty of the Greek resistance. Senorita Cruz badly miscast as a Cephalonian Greek girl (there are plenty of attractive good English speaking Greek actresses so why pick a Spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an English actor as her father  supposedly a Greek doctor!? Many of the supporting cast are well known actors and actresses from Greek theatre and TV series. The only foreign actor  to my knowledge  who has successfully portrayed a Greek was Anthony Quinn (as the Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba the Greek  as the plutocratic shipowner in the Greek Tycoon and as a Greek colonel in the Guns of Navarone.<br /><br />There is some historical truth reflected in the film. People who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not harsh  unlike the Germans who succeeded them. Also Mussolini's forces  as hinted in the movie  had been defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian campaign. After the Germans intervened in the Balkans they allowed the Italian military to occupy certain parts of Greece  so the refusal of the local government to surrender to Italian forces  rather than to the Germans. as portrayed in the film is quite plausible  although I am not certain this actually happened.,negative
In 4 words  Captain Corelli's Mandolin was completely out of tune with the book. The novel provided sufficient character background to understand the relationships and personal challenges the characters needed to overcome; the script writer chose to ignore the details. In ignoring them (e.g. the priest's role initially as a buffoon  but later as a spiritual leader  the fiancee's inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel  the bomb experts advice to Corelli and his eventual ironic demise)  the story and characters fall flat.<br /><br />This was the first movie that I've ever walked out of midway through. Interesting cinematography  great actors do not MAKE a film; the story does.,negative
I give it a 2  because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece  otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage came into with his first lines  I thought he was just kidding. Cage as an Italian ?? I'm sorry  but very wrong actor who's acting is also BAD  not to mention his Italiano accent. The story is very loose  it might have been good  but with other actors and obviously with other screenplay. The camera is great  photography also but why the hell did you cast Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz for the role. Please don't get me wrong  I don't have anything against Cage  he has some really great movies  but he obviously isn't for every role. It's really a pity that the cast wasn't better set  because the story has potential.,negative
1st watched 3/17/2002 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Mario Pinzauti): Silly  sex-filled master & slave having too many intimate relations movie. This movie seemed to care more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story around the sex. Laughable dubbing of the original Italian language in the version I watched with ridiculous ending where the attempt is made to give an anti-slave statement(or should I say one line). What a waste of time for everyone who watches this trash.,negative
Italian rip off of Mandingo and The Drum is a badly dubbed Italian life on the plantation yarn. Lots of people who don't look like they belong in the American South wear badly tailored costumes and wander around locations that look nothing like the American south. The plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman  the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows. The film promises hot steamy sex and lots of twisted violence but nothing ever really comes of any of it  its all tease. Its all probably racially insensitive  I couldn't notice since its artistically bankrupt. The final twist is at best laughable. A major turkey.,negative
Trading on the success of the 1975 hit  this film is a cheaply made story of a plantation where Massa gets down with the slave women  and the Missus gets down with the big black stud  and with massa'a son also. In fact  there is so much getting down going on  that I really don't know why anyone bothered to get dressed.<br /><br />So  if you want to see white women rolling their naked bodies all over tied up slaves  or you just like a movie with tits on display every five minutes  then this one is for you.<br /><br />There is a funny/sad story in here  but it only comes at the very end so as to not interfere with all the hot sweaty sex going on on the plantation.,negative
The Italians are undeniable masters in the questionable art of ripping off and imitating movies. What they do is take an innovative  money-making and foreign concept  maintain the basic plot and just add a whole lot of action  sleaze and political incorrectness. But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a reputedly notorious film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy? Well then  I guess  you simply disregard everything in terms of story-building or stylishness and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful slavery-saga Mandingo  released one year earlier  but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title  you shouldn't expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth  character drawings  unsettling atmosphere or thought-provoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships. MandingA is pure and simply a sexploitation effort where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes  in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already. The characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards  which is of course to expect when you're dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in South America. The elderly and supremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower (who probably also won a couple of Moustache-of-the-Year awards) who exploits and extendedly whips the slaves working for him. His mistress  who if I understood correctly is also his cousin (?)  is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to copulate with crucified slaves. When the plantation owner's son returns from Europe  after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted running time  the plot slightly begin to develop itself at last. The handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times (even in front of the slaves  supposedly to demonstrate how their masters do it) but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preacher's daughter. His romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger  and she plots a horribly cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever. Hey  I just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes Mandinga sound like an interesting film! Well  it's NOT and I apologize if I raised anyone's anticipations. It's an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through  but if the themes appeal to you  then definitely check out the aforementioned Mandingo. Much rather than sick exploitation  that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film  with real actors  great music and impressive filming locations. Mandinga has nothing  absolutely nothing to offer.,negative
This was a mish mash of a film that started out going nowhere  got lost on the way then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is FINALLY introduced. There were so many ugly  mutton-chopped guys in this film  I lost track of who was the owner and who were the overseers. I have a theory about the casting though; all the bad guys were played by ugly actors (and one ugly actress) and all the good guys/victims were played by beautiful actors. Indeed the actors who played the ultimate victims  the slaves  were gorgeous as was the innocent priest's daughter  while the plantation owner  his minipulative mistress and his overseers were pretty hard on the eyes. On purpose? You make the call.<br /><br />I hung in there till the end and some others might be able to make it as well. If you just want to look at bare breasts  there are plenty of them here and if you have a slave/master fetish then you'll love this film. Otherwise  watch it once  vomit  shower and never speak of it to anyone.,negative
I have no idea how anyone can give this movie high marks. I didn't rent it thinking it was the next great horror flick  the next great horror spoof  or the next great low-budget horror spoof. Obviously  this isn't meant to scare  but one fatal flaw with the production entirely sapped the joy out of the viewing experience. The sound editing was horrible. I had to work the volume control the entire movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even a low-budget spoof - when you're either turning the volume up or down  or trying to anticipate the next time you have to do so. The regular dialogue is very low  and all screams  noises  etc.  are VERY loud. We're not talking about toggling between 5 and 7 on the volume control  finding a happy medium at 6. We're talking toggling between 2 and 9 on the volume where it is virtually impossible to leave the volume alone. Again  this movie might be a decent example of what it is meant to be  but you're going to be spending so much time adjusting your volume control that you'll never have the chance to enjoy it.,negative
When I first looked at the back of the cover of this film  it seemed like me and my friends could be looking forward to 82 memorable minutes. And it certainly was memorable. Puckoon was the kind of movie where you keep asking yourself how this was possible. How it was possible that it was released on DVD at all. Out of all of the movies available at the video rental store that night...we might just have picked the worst. And yes  they had Tomb Raider. Absolutely nothing in this movie amused me even slightly. Who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story by suggestions from the main character? Out of all the stupid things you can totally ruin a movie with  this is now my favourite. The character Foggerty  the village idiot  played by Nickolas Grace is the most annoying character since they started making movies in color. If there is one single movie that you definately not should see this year  please let it be Puckoon  cause I don't think it can be any worse. I still wonder if this just might have been the worst way I have spent my money  and take my word for that I have made many lousy purchases over the years.,negative
technically  this movie would have had it all: decent actors  a nice landscape  no obvious sights of a lack of budget  a celebrity like richard attenborough. the plot summary also sounded promising  suggesting a satire on silly bureaucracy and common people outwitting it.<br /><br />however  it never delivers. the plot is simply too illogical. throughout the whole movie  not one person does a single sensible thing. mad politicians  ridiculous soldiers  brain-dead villagers - all just hustle from one incredible situation to the next. what they all do never makes sense in a context beyond the current scene.<br /><br />of course  this kind of movie has to be absurd and exaggerated. however  it's also supposed to have at least one instance to point out the madness behind splitting a city in the middle. actually  there are (at least) two attempts  which unfortunately fail: the main character  who doesn't seem to have a clue about what's happening to him  and the writer  who occasionally cracks jokes from the off that might be considered funny by an audience consisting solely of 12 year olds.<br /><br />what i found most impressing is that the movie tries to be funny all the time  but didn't made me laugh once. i've seen several bad funny movies  but until yet every single one of them featured at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so in this sense  puckoon is really remarkable.<br /><br />if you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot  check out brazil. don't waste your time on puckoon.,negative
Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen  and a huge influence on my life.<br /><br />This movie is limp and awful  and does his memory no credit. The script is cluttered and preserves too many lines from the book intact (the leg jokes here are incomprehensible). The actors' performances are uniformly ineffective  a great cast wasted  and the lead  Sean Hughes  delivers Milligan's belligerent hostilities in a plaintive whine  which misses the point completely.<br /><br />The gentle pacing is a killer as well. Farce should accelerate towards the end. The Goon Shows often did  the novel Puckoon definitely did  but this film  if anything  slows down just when you want the various elements to smash together in a final climax.<br /><br />Milligan narrated an abridged audio recording of Puckoon in 1980  with T.P. McKenna  Dermot Kelly  Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. Now  that's funny. Ten minutes of that is funnier than this whole film. I believe the LP was transferred to CD  but don't know if it's still in print.<br /><br />There is a movie of Adolf Hitler: My Part in his Downfall with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It too is a godawful mess  but it's funnier than this thing.<br /><br />It's possible that Milligan's spirit is too rambunctious for the screen. The other reviewers here are indulging in politeness and wishful thinking. This film fumbles virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint.,negative
Okay  now I am pretty sure that my summary got your attention and my commenting that Zazu Pitts is Satan is not without some basis. Let me explain. The film at first appears to be a dandy B-movie about an evil organization called the Crooked Circle and their vow of revenge in the form of murder on a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes. While this is very odd (especially the idea of a club of private citizens who solve crimes) and COULD have been interesting  this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of familiar supporting actors. Why? Well because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie whining just like Olive Oyl with a bad toothache!! While murders are being committed  people are being kidnapped or whatever  you can always count on Zazu whining at full volume--almost like someone's obnoxious 3 year-old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her! At the same time  she's NOT an integral part of the film but received top billing. Why she is even there is beyond me--I assume it's just to whine and yell. As a result  I found the movie practically unwatchable and it was completely ruined. Now you probably know why I referred to this actress of dubious talent as Satan! I'm sure that when the actors in this film saw the final product  they  too  felt pretty much the same way I did about her horrible overacting and amateurish performance.<br /><br />This film is in the public domain and can be found for free download on the internet. I can see why.,negative
Even those of us who like cute animal pictures --- and I abhor them ---would be hard pressed to find any merit in this abysmally bad travesty of a film. Perhaps inspired by 101 Dalmatians with its smart and loyal dogs  its dumb and devious humans and its absurdly happy and predictable ending  the alternate title 101 Turkeys springs to mind. That would just about cover everyone involved in its unfortunate production. I dismissed it as some inane Hollywood perversion of British customs before learning  to my horror  that it actually is a Canadian film  done in Victoria BC  that phony British theme park of a town  while sucking tax dollars out of Ottawa ON  that equally phony pit of Canadian mediocrity. Let me count the ways it is bad. The dizzy plot? The asinine script? The dismal performances and sophomoric direction? The cloyingly clever animals? The endless clichés and predictable slapstick? On second thought  neither I nor those browsing the IMDb have time for a complete catalogue of its failings. Yet were I to detail its merits  this space would remain blank. Trust me  it is bad; a signal monument in the vast pantheon of truly terrible (Canadian) cinema. If you have seen it already  my condolences. If you have not  stay away from it as you would SARS or bubonic plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Don't even let your children see it lest their tiny minds be warped by the even tinier minds of those who financed  fabricated and filmed this frightful folly. Perhaps tonight  when I retire  I will have a nightmare with ghastly fanged beasts springing from the bed table as I flee in frantic flight. I hope so. It will be a far far better thing I do than watch this beastly banal boondoggle. But then  I might dream that I had to watch it a second time and the sheer terror and cold sweat of that makes me want to stay up all night  trembling at the very possibility of seeing it again even as a bad dream. I might even find something worthwhile to watch in its stead. Maybe Godzilla or Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes Perhaps the instruction video for my built in vacuum cleaner.,negative
The Duke is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where an old Duke (John Neville) dies and to avoid his large property and the vast riches to be taken from him after death by 2 devious aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie Heyman); he passes his Dukeship down to his dog. The dog's best friend  an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper) whose parents die becomes orphaned by the former Duke due to him being her great uncle. A young chef named Florian arrives  with him and Charlotte instantly connecting creating a romantic sub-plot which in its own way  acts as the under tone for the main plot line being the activities of Hubert  The 'Duke' and his many activities and love interests with other dogs. All this is watched over by James Doohan who plays a Butler who is determined to try and serve his old Duke by doing his best to serve his new master  Hubert. Doohan acts as the older character there to comfort and advise the younger ones whilst he over looks and performs various ridiculous tasks under his new master. A fine comedic performance mixed with elements of drama to end the career of a fine and influential actor.<br /><br />Though from the technical viewpoint  I dislike this film as I only watched upon discovering James Doohan's role. Though the plot is good  elements of the writing and directing have to be obscured. Ignoring the absurdity of a Doggie Duke  I personally dislike the over use of comedic and outrageous jokes upon the 'bad' characters due to their ludicrousness. The dependence on hygiene related humour as you like is much too apparent and general silliness of many characters doesn't appeal to me. The director  Phillip Spink uses mid-long shots too often with either an overdubbed voice or affecting the overall sound quality. Plus  the acting of Muirhead and Heyman  whilst good at the dramatic and romantic sequences  fall drastically short fulfilling the wholesale requirements regarding the role.<br /><br />But  as a mature movie fan  I find it easy to be over critical of a simple family film designed to make you laugh. I can admit I found certain bits funny and other bits touching along with a plot that may be far-fetched  but has definite connections. I do not recommend this film to mature movie fans but I do highly recommend it to Dog lovers  families who wish to enjoy a funny film for their child and James Doohan fans who wish to see 'Scotty' in his final role.,negative
I had the misfortune of seeing this crapulous effort on television a few years ago. Suffice it to say Michael Gross phones in his performance  and Hasselhoff is the least convincing thief/psycho...EVER! If you have a couple of hours to kill  watch it and prepare to laugh.,negative
Nothing special to see here  the animation has being outdated and the plot is a typical futuristic era. This film has an original story  but if it doesn't have an original plot or characters  so in my opinion it's not worth seeing. I'm not saying that the movie was bad  it was just a typical anime story and I thought I watched this movie like a thousand times. So if you are looking for something original see another thing.,negative
Sylvester the cat stowaway upon a ship that Tweety bird happens to be on with his owner Granny. Oh I don't even have enough words to convey how much I disdain both the Tweety and Granny characters. They simply are not funny to me and made this short quite the chore to sit through indeed. Sylvester is a great character on his own  but there's only so much he can do when confronted by the sheer awfulness of that accursed bid and senile old witch of a Granny. This animated short can be found on disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and features an optional commentary by Micheal Barrier.<br /><br />My Grade: D+,negative
Opening with some blatantly reused footage from 'Kit for Cat'  'Tweety's S.O.S' fails to live up to that classic cartoon. Instead  we get an example of Friz Freleng's Tweety and Sylvester series at its most generic. Unlike Chuck Jones's Road Runner series  which strived to introduce new jokes to the same setting  Freleng's series seemed happy enough to recycle jokes as long as the characters were in a different place. 'Tweety's S.O.S'  then  basically amounts to this time let's put 'em on a boat. It's not an entirely weak cartoon. There are a few good jokes  mostly involving Granny's glasses  but they are outweighed by gags you can see coming a mile off (the seasickness routine) and it all builds to another of those endings where someone else other than Tweety says I tawt I taw a putty tat  a joke that worked well once but has diminishing returns. 'Tweety's S.O.S' will probably please children who enjoy virtually any cartoon but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags it's definitely one to avoid.,negative
I happened to catch this movie on late night TV. I saw the opening credits and thought this looks good. Well I was very wrong. While not excruciatingly bad (it had some funny and tender moments)it lacked any sense of cohesion.<br /><br />It started off well enough with Kathy Bates'character having a midlife crisis of sorts when her husband leaves her and her singing idol is murdered. But Kathy has played these disaffected women so well before - think Fried Green Tomatoes. The problem wasn't Kathy  it was the clueless screenplay that wandered all over the place. It was as if the writers must have been thinking what will we do next. The script also felt very contrived.<br /><br />Some others who have posted comments on this movie have wondered why it didn't receive a cinematic release. The main reason I think would have been to avoid embarrassment and the critics would have murdered it.<br /><br />Having said all that I thought the small woman who played Maudie was fantastic and stole the movie  not to mention how beautiful she is.,negative
Widow hires a psychopath as a handyman. Sloppy film noir thriller which doesn't make much of its tension promising set-up. (3/10),negative
This movie was produced by the biggest producer in Costa Rica. Although their authors brag about it as a the biggest movie in Costa Rica ever made and their actors even dare to say that they didn't get an Oscar Nomination due to it's political relevance with oil (-he he  right) ...Well  this is all a lie. This movie was supposedly based on a book written by Carlos Salazar Herrera about a love triangle (super cliché soap opera-like subject) and it secondary story is about an oil problem on the Atlantic Coast of Costa Rica with an American oil company who wanted to explore oil deposits on the region  but at the end it never was approved by the government. Now  it may have some nice footage about the beaches  but that's it; nothing bigger than that... it is all in the camera. Most of the actors are lousy  except for two or three. The rest lack of sense of what acting means: they overact most of the time. The story is completely common and cliché  worthy of a cheap Mexican soap opera as I said.. because the crew advertised it as a protest movie about oil  but 80% of the movie is based on a stupid love triangle. The script is nothing impressing  it is very simple and the dialogs are not very thought. It has also got some editing problem on a couple of scene changes... but besides that is pretty decent. The director did an alright job  I mean  he is not like an Oliver Stone but he did his job with the resources he had handy. I would like to question him why instead of using Costarican actor he spent most of the money on foreign ones.. I mean after all they bragged about being an 100% Costarican Production... that's what you at least expect. Final the end is is not well done  there are flaws and details that don't match or are useless. Besides being the most elaborated movie in all Costarican history  I think it's mediocre. You can make way more interesting and better pictures with less cash. Never heard of Pi? Anyway  if you are curious about Costa Rican or Central American movies  this one will do  but you are definitively not missing anything.,negative
I have just seen Caribe a couple of nights ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival held here in Dallas  and I must express my discontent. The opening caption tries to tell us that the film is a portrayal of the current invasion of South American countries (Costa Rica  in this particular case) by North American oil companies  and the negative effects  both economic and environmental  of this invasion. The main characters are a married couple who live a simple  pleasant life maintaining a banana farm. Right away  a woman arrives and announces that she is the wife's half-sister. I'm not going to go into specifics about this (and to be honest  I don't feel that I'm spoiling anything with this review)  yet another key point is that the company to whom they distribute their bananas drops them due to budget demands in a poor economy. So  the main conflict that is supposed to be addressed in the movie is of the husband between the rock and the hard place  trying to preserve his livelihood. On one hand  the Reynolds oil company has basically offered him employment and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the town to allow the company to begin drilling in their town (compromising his standing with the community and the community itself). On the other hand  he is faced with being dead broke  but on the side of his community  protesting the drilling. Given the length of this film  it would have been ample time to explore the issues just described  but it just doesn't happen  and I'll tell you why. You will notice that this film has won a couple of awards so far  one for direction and an audience award. I'm not going to pick apart Esteban's direction  it wasn't bad or good enough for me to be all that passionate about writing anything. The audience award was at a film festival in Spain  and for it to gain an audience award  I'd have to imagine that Spanish people just dig soap operas. In fact  Central and South America dig soap operas as well  I know that much. I assume that Esteban was either aiming to take advantage of this or that he himself digs soap operas  because that is what unfolds over the course of this film  so much to the point that it kicks the whole oil company plot to the side  almost as if they imagined halfway through the making of this film that it had become tiresome  because it seems like at least three of the supporting characters have had their back story and character development severely compromised to make room for more sex and crying scenes. The only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters  and at no point do you actually get to find out who the hell he is. It's almost as if they cut his screen time just short of taking him out of the film entirely. From time to time  they toy with the oil against community plot  but these are digressions at best. What we see a lot more of are scenes of passion  jealousy  betrayal  adultery  etc. These themes saturate the story to such a degree that the oil company 'sub'plot becomes unnecessary. It's almost as if this was a stunt to legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) by throwing in a little political relevance. Nevertheless  the film gets so caught up in the romance that it ultimately doesn't know what to do with itself  resulting in an ending so tacked on that you're left wondering what it is that you've been waiting around for  or if there was ever anything to begin with. Here are two things that I think could have saved this movie: either cut out the half-sister or cut out the oil company. It's obvious which one of the two they were more interested in. Or  perhaps if Caribe had been an hour longer  they could have worked this all out. Regardless  I'd have been fine with a straight-up soap opera and I think that the subject of oil companies exploiting foreign nations is in dire need of addressing by the film community. Caribe is both and neither. These two angles could have worked together had they been balanced accordingly  but with a romantic plot running around in circles and taking up almost twice as much time as necessary at the expense of an oil plot that's barely been established to begin with  both sides suffer. Best of all  the romance plot is never even resolved. I'd like to say I'd watch this movie again to see what I've missed  but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is. As far as I'm concerned  it wouldn't matter if I saw Caribe ten more times. I've missed it because it is simply not there.,negative
This movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that Perrugorria have done. <br /><br />It looks like a commercial from beginning to end. The ¨director¨spent the whole time on a tripod  it doesn't have pace  rhythm. It's illogical. what a mess. You can tell what's gonna happen since the first 15 minutes  and the ending...Wow<br /><br />------spoiler-------<br /><br />Jesus Christ  how the hell Perrugorria got shot? Are you serious? Worst scene of someone getting shot ever!<br /><br />------end of spoiler-----<br /><br />Bad directing  bad script  bad acting...Really bad overall. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. It's a waste of money and time.,negative
Mom begins at night in the middle of nowhere  at what looks like a wooden building in the desert. A pick-up truck pulls up & an angry Father chucks his slutty daughter Virginia Monroe (Claudia Christian) out & leaves her there  but she isn't alone as the shadowy figure of Nestor Duvalier (Brion James) watches her from a short distance. Virginia tries to make conversation but as she grinds a cigarette out under her Leopard print  thigh high  high heeled boots Nestor grabs her by her throat & drags her off into the darkness. Nestor then rips her top open  turns into a monster & starts to eat her innards. Virginia is the latest victim of a serial killer that have Lieutenant Carlo Hendrix (Art Evans) & the LAPD baffled  or at least that's the message a local TV news reporter named Clay Dwyer (Mark Thomas MIller) is telling his viewers. Clay is happily living with his pregnant girlfriend Alice (Mary Beth McDonough) & therefore his Mother Emily (Jeanne Bates) has a spare room going which she decides to rent out to the 'blind' dark sunglass wearing Nestor. Unfortunately for Emily she accidentally knocks Nestor's sunglasses off which reveal he has strange coloured eyes  Nestor then turns into a monster again & bites Emily turning her into a flesh-eating monster just like himself. Nestor takes Emily out to train her  they find a suitable homeless bum (Rory VanSaint)  murder him & eat his guts but Emily's son Clay has witnessed the whole thing & he must choose between doing what is right & his love for his Mother who now just happens to be a grotesque bloodsucking & flesh-eating monster!<br /><br />Edited  written & directed by Patrick Rand I thought Mom was a pretty awful film. Looking at some of the other comments on the IMDb & the genre listing it has been given it appears many seem to think that Mom is a comedy horror. Well I can tell you now that I didn't see any comedic elements in Mom at all because there aren't any  unless they are very subtle. The only thing that I can assume is that people see comedy in the actual situation which Mom presents  that being an old lady turning into a flesh-eating monster & the predictable problems & emotional angst that it causes to her son who finds out. There are no jokes (apart from naming a prostitute Beverly Hills (Stella Stevens))  slapstick humour or anything even remotely funny in the film itself & as far as I could see it is played totally straight throughout it's 90 minute run time. So with there being no comedy in Mom that must mean there's lots of horror right? Wrong  Mom sucks & is painfully slow to watch especially after the first thirty odd minutes which consist of Nestor turning into a monster a couple of times  biting Emily  showing her how to hunt for food & Clay finding out. Until this point Mom was moving at a fairly decent pace  had some OK special make-up effects & had me interested  unfortunately Mom runs for another hour which is basically the emotional crap suffered by Emily's Son  the eventual breakdown of his marriage & him being torn between love for his Mother & the fact that she's a flesh-eating monster. This part of the film is incredibly slow  boring & as dull as dishwater even having the nerve to resort to a clichéd role-reversal scenario where Clay tells his Mom to go to her room & stay there locking the door behind her  telling her off & putting bars over her window so she can't escape her room. Mom's script totally ignores the monsters origins & ask's us to just accept that this thing exists without giving a single reason why we should  no matter how silly an explanation might have been I think some background to the monster would have helped. Technically Mom is bland & cheap looking  although I can't say it's badly made it's very average stuff all the way with nothing that particularly impresses or anything with which I could make fun of to pass the time. The special make-up effect's on the monster are OK but their used in very quick flashes  blink & you'll miss them. Don't be fooled by any fancy video box artwork like I was  the monster is only in it three times maximum & all of those are within the pacey first thirty minutes. There isn't much gore either  a severed arm  some brief intestine eating  a burnt body & a drill in someone's arm is all we get. The acting is OK but please Mr. Brion James what is that dodgy accent all about!? At least James had the good sense to know he was in crap & sensibly opted to be killed off early on in the proceedings  everyone else are nobodies expect the black Lieutenant who was also a black police officer in Fright Night (1985) but you may recognise him from Die Hard 2 (1990)  he made Mom & Die Hard 2 in the same year?! Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Overall there is nothing by which I can really recommend Mom as a horror film & it certainly isn't a comedy as far as I'm concerned. Very poor  very disappointing & yet again I've been conned by fancy video-box artwork with lots of stills of cool looking monsters. Definitely one to avoid.,negative
Lame B-horror that takes itself too damn seriously considering its subject matter concerns an aging old dear who has been turned into a creature of the night by a lodger who has come to rent a room from her. When said lodger is killed off  Mom has to go out to feed on her own and that causes some family strain and also garners some attention from the authorities.<br /><br />My main complaint is that this film should have brought THE FUNNY. It failed to do so although it did have some mild gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to keep the B-movie crowd happy. I've seen worse but I wouldn't give this one a rec--4.5/10.,negative
This is probably the most uninvolving film I've ever seen. I watched it because I have a soft spot for Leon (everything else Besson has done has been just awful  in my opinion  with the exception of the script for Wasabi) and Jean Reno. It's a testament to just how bad this film is that Reno  one of the most charismatic and effortlessly affable actors (admittedly he's just starting out here) can't make this film  or the moments in which he is on screen  watchable.<br /><br />It's all very film-schooly: black and white  no dialogue  people doing things for no apparent reason  people chasing each other while in turn being chased by a shaky camera. And  predictably  none of it is entertaining.<br /><br />It's not a French Mad Max as some people have claimed (actually  I think they mean Mad Max 2) - that is a superficial comparison based only on the fact that both films have a post-apocalyptic setting  and is just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. Mad Max 2 was pulsating  Mad Max 2 was exciting  Mad Max 2 was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of these.<br /><br />I know it's supposed to be cool to like arty black-and-white French films and equally cool to say you saw something in them that other people did not (or you managed to sit through it without feeling drowsy)  which is why I wouldn't trust anyone who claims to like Le Dernier Combat  because I see nothing of worth in it whatsoever; it asks for so much and gives nothing back. I found myself drifting from it after about five minutes and it never did anything to regain my full attention. Anyone who can sit through it undistracted isn't human  or  at the very most  is psychotic. (Actually  they're probably just trying to seem cool).,negative
Every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense  anticipation and allure to the plot. This story falls completely flat in this area. There is no conflict - at least none that would inhibit the eventual joining of the two lead characters  and so suspense is flat  there is no anticipation  and there really is no allure at all.<br /><br />The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is representative of friendship at best  and with the talent of these two particular actors  I was quite surprised. During the movie  I expected them more to play a game of checkers and chat about the weather than see any moving passion.<br /><br />While I'm a fan of both actors  I do believe that the casting in this movie was off - or  perhaps the direction was off-base and it impacted their deliveries. The writing was very weak  which also might have impacted the performances; most certainly  the script could have used some help from some Harlequin writers who have real experience putting the heat in romance.<br /><br />This movie may be worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon  but only after it's on the cheap shelf.<br /><br />(Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).,negative
This movie is the final straw. As two dedicated fans of the romantic comedy  this movie has finally made us realise that nothing good has come out of this genre since Love Actually. There was nothing good about the film whatsoever. It was an affront to love  death and everything in between. Including horses and beaches. There was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. This movie took the spark out of Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane cannot act to save her life. She was unconvincing in her laugh  cry  and dance. And she needs a better haircut. There is no reason to watch this movie. Save yourself. The romantic comedy is officially dead.,negative
I can't believe the high marks people have given this film on this site. The writing is incredibly bad with people coming in at just the right time and revealing exactly what the heroine is doing to try to escape. (Don't you just hate it when that happens?). And the acting is so very  very bad that you may get a splinter in your eye from all the scenery being chewed.<br /><br />A nut is holding her hostage  children are outside the open screen  so she whimpers for help instead of screaming when only a moment ago she was brave enough to be smashing windows to yell to these same children.<br /><br />She's finally free and alone in the house. Her chance to go for help  so what does she do? Wanders around the house and lies down. She's in the basement  locked away. So what does she do? Takes a little nap. Come on! Most of the movie is the nut wandering away and finding her sitting there snoozing when he wakes her up. Four times! What? If the writer is too bored to actually write a real plot why should we be paying attention? I think the key here is that it was originally a play for the radio  so they filled in with the heroine just sitting around rather than pretending to be screen writers and actually writing any action.<br /><br />And the ending is horrendous.<br /><br />The whole movie is completely implausible  horribly written and almost comically acted. Beware this movie at all costs!,negative
We thought this was one of the worst movies ever. I had to volunteer to watch the end. The romance was not believable; the characters were not developed; the love affair made hardly any sense; it was miscast; and scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like the ADAMS FAMILY GOES ON VACATION...just creepy  gypsy and cheesy; and the OUTERBANKS does not look typically like those houses on the surf; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it was not theirs. Also..it was not realistic. hurrricanes give you plenty of notice to batten down the hatches.<br /><br />Also the friend was superfluous; and did not match the story What did the civil war have to do with the outerbanks anyway? I also have to mention the wardrobe...did D. Lane have to have a scarf/pashmina/shawl on in every scene? It was overdone. She looked good enough to not have to hide things; without making them obvious like with light slacks.<br /><br />Lastly I am concerned with the impact on our landfills when everyone has to dispose of this stupid  and I mean STUPID movie!!!! Don't fall for the hype on this one!!!!!! We did. Not even watchable.,negative
*Warning: 1 tiny inconsequential spoiler* You're right. This was no Bridges of Madison County. As soon as the lonely woman and Richard Gere checked into the big empty hotel  it was a foregone conclusion something kind of fun would happen. The question is: how will it come about? The answer is some stupid connect-the-dots story not worth sitting through. In one supposed bonding experience  they get drunk and clean out the cupboard of old cans.(That was my spoiler.) And the next day they put them back. LOL It wasn't compelling AT ALL. I'm an old married lady like the one in the movie and MY friendships are more interesting than HER romance with Richard Gere. LOL . . . It did have that advantage. You walk away and go  oh brother . . . even I could have written something more believable than that. I guess my life isn't quite as dull as I thought it was if I can scoff at a romance with Richard Gere. LOL! And that friend inherited that totally contemporary  probably computer-generated mansion  resting half in the ocean  from her GRANDMOTHER who built it AFTER THE CIVIL WAR??? Maybe her grandmother is Oprah and this was WAY after the Civil War? And yes  WHERE WAS THE EMAIL? What alternative universe do these people live in? I never want to see another movie that pretends we don't have email  and facebook and texting. And OK  maybe these people have a horrible aversion to delivering news over the phone  but don't ask me to believe anyone in this age of instant communication that someone just drops into your life without calling first.,negative
"Not quite a bomb? The only thing missing was the enriched uranium. Actually the script may have worked if the lead roles had been cast with younger actors  but the dramatics of an aging Diane Lane acting as if she was a teenager (or even a twenty-something) was too much to stomach. Every time she (Adrienne) would jump into the arms of Richard Gere and then pull both heels up behind her  you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face as he was probably thinking  Oh, my aching back...this babe sure doesn't weight 125 lbs. anymore! Anyway  both characters were distinctly unlikeable  especially Richard Gere's: a self absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) that was on some kind of soul quest after a botched operation left him with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm). Then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what happened. Dr. Flanner is on his way to meet said angry husband (at the husband's request) when he meets up with Adrienne. She is recently split from her unfaithful husband (shock) and is helping out a friend by watching her beach-front cottage rental. Of course  that's where Dr. Flanner ends up staying and they both end up falling MADLY in love (especially after she finds out he is a rich doctor AND a plastic surgeon). In between romantic interludes and a nauseating song/dance routine that Lane (Adrienne) performs while listening to an old LP (no CD's?)  they both try to figure how their lives got so totally screwed up. Dr. Flanner was also not much of a father and has a son (who is also a Dr.) who resents him for not being there for him while he was growing up. (Naturally Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than raising an impetuous  distracting boy.) To make a long (predictable) story short  Adrienne helps Dr. Flanner face his inner demons as well as confront said angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table (after going in for a routine cyst removal of the face). Dr. Flanner is FINALLY able to tell the husband (played excruciatingly sympathetic by Scott Glenn) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it was all the fault of that danged anesthesiologist. I told him she was too old for that much juice! Glenn's character (Robert Torrelson) appears to accept Dr. Flanner's apology. It's hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good Dr. at all or thinking about some acreage that he needs to plow. Ever more circumspect  Dr. Flanner then decides he needs to visit his son (who is now practicing medicine pro-bono in a third world country) to mend their relationship. Unfortunately  that means he must temporarily bid adieu to Adrienne. Of course  while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu  he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to Adrienne (who nearly swoons like a school girl every time she gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye. Evidently  apologizing to Robert Torrelson for his wife's death was the second hardest thing. In the end he gets killed in a freak mud slide (poetic justice as in mud pack?) and she is left with just the memories of what could have been...hopefully no more Gere/Lane sequels!",negative
I had high hopes for this film  even though I had not read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together--should be good already. But the film does not deliver on the promise. I kept waiting for more depth to the characters and there wasn't. I have no problem with the fact that it only took a weekend for them to fall in love. That can happen. But we never really get to know the characters. I would have liked more focus on them. The film reminded me in places of Bridges of Madison County  and that film was far better. I really felt for the characters in that film  and there was a chemistry (much more passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that there wasn't between Gere and Lane. Each of them are very good actors in his or her own right. Simply not the right movie for them together.,negative
Lonely  disconnected  middle-class housewife in the midst of a divorce seeks solace to reflect on her immediate future. At some sort of bed and breakfast by (well  literally in the sea) the ocean that for some sort of odd reason she subs for the owner. Enter lonely  arrogant Richard Gere. He is a plastic surgeon. He is the only guest at the inn in the sea. Diane Lane is the lonely housewife. You'll never guess these two fall immediately in love. A tropical storm makes them true lovers.<br /><br />The subplots in this melodrama make little or no sense. The locations  photography are fine. Gere remains one of the most over-rated actors in cinema and does not disappoint. Ms. Lane must've needed the money  but phones in her part with grace.,negative
While I am not a woman  I can enjoy a chick flick if its good. This one however is beyond bad. You have the by the book story  girl is getting divorced  boy with issues shows up. BOOM magic happens and his demons are banished as she realizes her life has a new purpose.<br /><br />Now while I can believe that kind of thing might happen  I am not an idiot. It wouldn't happen over a weekend of geriatric rumpy-pumpy  it would take time. Yet here the producers know they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes so they force the changes of the two to happen  I suppose a night of getting hammered and a night of gramps and granny going at it like dogs in heat might be enough if you believed romance novels were the gospel... but most people don't.<br /><br />Now  if that isn't enough... the producers remembered that a chick flick needs to make the viewer cry... well they tried to make you cry with the two senior citizens getting jiggy with it by failed... so how could they hit you again? Why I know  lets kill off one of the characters for no good reason at all except that a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye.... and now lets have the teen daughter magically bond with heart broken mom for no reason besides the fact that it would be nice (completely unreal  but who cares).<br /><br />So there you have it... girl find boy  boy find love  death finds boy and mom cries.... what a movie - NOT.,negative
This is one of the more unromantic movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />Casting: Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore. Diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself. Supporting cast not too memorable.<br /><br />Story: The medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting. The story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about. There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here. <br /><br />The setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive. <br /><br />NOT destined to be a great one to remember.,negative
Here in Australia Nights in Rodanthe is being promoted in the same class as the Notebook. Quite frankly what a lot of rot.<br /><br />This film is a like a recipe. On paper we have all the right ingredients... Richard Gere normally perfect in this genre  Diane Lane an old favourite from Under Tuscan Sun and Unfaithful  ocean side location  solitude and yet the movie sucks. At the session we went to yesterday afternoon a women next to my wife fell asleep and half way through the movie got up and left! The main problem is there is no build up or credibility to the relationship in the first place. And perhaps there are too many long faces and downbeat if you like histories that Gere and Lane's characters bring to the movie. There's hours of those balanced out with perhaps 5 minutes of what we can to see... romance! There's no warmth from Gere's character  Lane looks dreadful at the start of the movie and all washed out. So as the viewer we cannot really connect to the characters.<br /><br />Others here say the book is great. Well be it the screenplay  direction or production someone here has made a real mess of this movie. It's like the scenes and the buildup are a deck of cards except instead of being in the correct order they've just been thrown together all over the place.<br /><br />Very disappointing... save your money for when it hits the video shops and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to the weekly rate.,negative
Frankly  after Cotton club and Unfaithful  it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film  because it is BAD. The acting was bad  the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere. It was well shot  but  then again  it is a big budget movie. It was too predictable  even for a chick flick. I even knew from the beginning that he was going to die in the end  the only thing I didn't know was how. Too politically correct. Very disappointing. The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house  because it is beautiful. But  if you want that  watch National geographic. I love Lane  but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy. As far as Gere goes  he's a good actor  but he had movies like this  so I'm not surprised. An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.,negative
Richard Gere and Diane Lane star in a chick flick romance with the sort of ending I get really angry about...lets just say its not my cup of tea  just like the dime store romances are not my cup of tea.<br /><br />The plot has a doctor stopping at an inn and meeting a woman that he has a deep but brief affair with. He goes off to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life.<br /><br />Well acted and well made the filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line. This is the stuff of dime store romances that makes the women swoon and the men shake their head in disbelief. I wouldn't be so adverse to the film as a mindless romance  except that the film takes a turn in the final reel that is so out of left field as to be completely unbelievable. Why must certain types of movies do stupid things like this? It really ruined it for me.<br /><br />If you like romance give it a shot  though wait for cable.,negative
My husband brought this home from the video store  so I could watch something while stuck home sick. The sort of sick where you could never concentrate on a book  but a sorta silly  light  romantic flick sounds just right (that  and a bowl of chicken soup). Well  he meant well.<br /><br />My first thought (as some others post here also) was that the house MUST be fake...it's not only isolated alone on the beach  but set on moorings into the loose sand  and so close to the ocean that the surf waves go directly under the house! This looks so obviously dangerous (in hurricane country  in THE FALL)  so potentially disastrous that I was sure filmmakers had simply CGI'd the whole thing (or used movie magic to plunk a cute B&B into the surf).<br /><br />But I have to tell you guys  thanks to teh interwebs  I can say that the house  Serendipity is very real  is indeed near Rodanthe and except for some window dressing and shrubs  appears mostly as it does in the film. You can rent it yourself  off season  for $1710 a week (or about $3850 in summer)! Go for it! But...interestingly  the house has severe problems. The second thing that struck me after would be washed away was what about the plumbing/electrical? in that surf?  and sure enough  Serendipity was condemned for a break in the sanitation  caused by overwash from the ocean. (They are rebuilding.)<br /><br />And the house isn't from the Civil War. Not to mention that Viola Davis  playing cliché black best friend (thankless role for a fine actress  last seen in Doubt)  is not remotely old enough that her GRANDMOTHER could have built anything in the Civil War! HELLO! that was 150 years ago! Try great-great-GREAT! (In reality  Serendipity was built in 1988  laughably recently.) <br /><br />The basic film is built on a typical Nicholas Sparks weeper  which means a lot of coincidence and trite predictable happenstance. It is also aimed in a very pandering way towards women -- you know  us women who love B&Bs  fusty antiques and knick-knacks...who dream of romance and guys who look like Richard Gere and dancing in the moonlight. Don't give us plot  or thoughtful character development; just set up some mechanisms and bring on the love scenes!<br /><br />Gere plays a plastic surgeon  who lost a female patient during a routine surgery for a benign cyst on her cheek. Of course  she died of an overdose of ANESTHESIA  so you wonder right away why the surgeon is guilted up and not the anesthesiologist! HELLO! where is that guy? Why is the wrong doctor feeling guilty?<br /><br />Gere has come to pout and confront the woman's husband  and is staying at the remote B&B...who should be there  why the ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE INN...Diane Lane! She's a lonely divorcée  with rotten kids  and an ex-hubby who wants her back. While she's trying to decide about that  the cliché best black friend has her subbing as hostess at the B&B.<br /><br />Now  in the real world  if this set up ever even happened  the doctor would look like Ernest Borgnine...and the lonely divorcée  like Rosie O'Donnell. He'd spend his vacation horndogging 22 year old girls on the beach  while she sulked and thought about going on a diet. But this isn't the real world; I digress.<br /><br />The couple confess all  fall in love  a hurricane hits...they make love  fall in love  he has to go away  he dies and she cries a lot about that. The end.<br /><br />There  I've saved you from it; now you don't have to torture yourself or any male acquaintances (husbands  sons  boyfriends) from sitting through this tripe. Very wearying.<br /><br />Someone else asked why Diane Lane  a perfect tiny woman (whom filmmakers seem to love to cast  because she's just pretty and thin enough that most women would like to look like her  but she's 45ish and not over-the-top  so she isn't threatening) is constantly covered in big tarp-like shawls. This would make sense if she was chubby  but she isn't.<br /><br />Anyways  someone throw a pretty  paisley shawl over this film. So we don't have to watch it. Conclusion: read a book  unless you are too sick. If too sick  go to sleep.,negative
If you read the book before seeing the movie you may be disappointed like I was. The book was great and I was sure after seeing the movie preview that the movie would be great as well  however I felt like I was watching a movie where the director and cast did not even read what these characters where like. The movie is short and they do not really ever make us feel that these people were truly in love and felt like sole mates. Even if the movie did not go in the same direction as the book at least they could of made the romance between these two characters feel more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and they have good chemistry however they just did not develop a long enough storyline for us to see how they longed for each other. The book was true love story and I think this movie could of been a lot better.,negative
"Wow  what an overrated movie this turned out to be! It was supposed to be an extremely suspenseful tale of a crazed killer holding a woman hostage and in terror in her home. Well  I doubt it terrorized audiences in the early '50s and I know it would put today's audiences asleep.<br /><br />Sends shivers down the spine, proclaims the New York Times. No  the only shivers I get is that anyone is left on the planet who believes anything the N.Y. Times prints about anything.<br /><br />Well  it was about a deranged man who held a woman hostage for a short time in her house but the man. Howard Wilton (Robert Ryan) was actually harmless and friendly. In fact  this was one of the nicest roles Ryan ever played! Yes  Wilton was nuts but he never harmed the woman and only wanted a friend to trust.<br /><br />The film even turned boring after awhile with very little going on except a lot of yakking. <br /><br />Beware  my reader.....this sucks.",negative
Let me get this straight:<br /><br />Hotshot plastic surgeon loses a patient on the operating table while removing a cyst from her face and ends up falling in love with recently separated bed and breakfast hostess within about 24 hours of meeting her due to her solid advice on bedside manner.<br /><br />Wow. Move over The Notebook  there's a new kid in town.<br /><br />Where to begin. Well  how about the depth of this relationship? I think we can safely sum up the foundation of this undying love in the following steps:<br /><br />1. Exchange polite pleasantries over a bite of salad. 2. Drink copious amounts of Jack Daniels; play basketball with old food 3. Provide glib  unsolicited advice to each other on your crappy lives. 4. Make love during a hurricane. 5. Devote your lives to each other via airmail.<br /><br />I noticed George C Wolfe has The Hairball and United Kanye West Project in his dossier. Would stick to your genre be too harsh? Enough said. I think most would agree that the best love stories make us cry  or laugh or even hope. But the reason they are able to do that is that  somewhere during the storyline  we really start to care about the characters we're watching on screen. To make us care  there must be time spent developing these characters...their lives  their history  why we're watching them now. Wolfe didn't seem to want to waste our time with such trivialities  and instead provided us with all of about 8 minutes of background information on each character before hurling us into an intense one-on-one interaction between two ACTORS we've all come to adore  but two CHARACTERS we could care less about.<br /><br />For one brief tender moment when Richard Gere exclaims that he doesn't expect her to listen to his problems  and she invites him for dinner  the viewer sees a glimmer - a beginning - of something special between these two characters. But instead of being allowed to enjoy the anticipation and playfulness of what happens next in the wonderful  unpredictable joy that is courtship  we are instead pushed headlong into a love affair between two people we hardly know.<br /><br />Let's face it. We have all heard cheesy one liners in Romantic films. But the reason we cut some slack to Bogart in Casablanca or Nicholson in Something's Gotta Give is because our hearts and minds have been lifted to the heavens and dragged through the mud and back again with these characters  and by the time they deliver the line  we're so deeply involved with their plight  we don't even notice the cheese factor. Since Wolfe doesn't allow us to love or even like our protagonists  all we're left with a fromage sandwich and a few snickers in the audience.<br /><br />Wolfe takes the old Hollywood director's phrase cut to the chase much too literally here. As each stilted one liner is delivered by our cast  the viewer is left wondering if director Wolfe is subliminally saying to the audience: c'mon. it's a Richard Gere romance. just buy in.<br /><br />It is as a result of this stunning lack of character - or relationship - development that the film's climax fails miserably to tug at our hearts. When Gere's character dies  I felt like I was watching the news about someone I didn't know passing away. Or watching a ladies' eights rowing race during the beijing olympics. Just. Didn't. Care.<br /><br />Epic. Fail.,negative
I like all different types of movies  so this is not a bash on romantic movies from a guy who only likes The Matrix etc etc.<br /><br />I just felt it was a lousy movie. I don't feel that there was enough buildup of the characters to fall in love. They were there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major issues in each of their lives  Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and helplessly in love?? It isn't realistic. This movie didn't make me buy into it and feel it emotionally and that is something that you look for in a good plot. Some emotional connection. If someone can relate to them falling in love that quickly  without any true substance   than so be it. You are neither right or wrong. Different strokes for different folks.<br /><br />Another very unbelievable component to the movie was Diane Lane's very rude teenage daughter becoming nice and sympathetic at the end of the movie. Does a teenage girl who is that miserable and aggravated at her mother for not getting back with her cheating husband going to just have a switch turn on and be nice? This movie  in a nutshell  had some big names  but to me  was a major disappointment.,negative
Wow. Not because of the 3-D imagery  which at times was used nicely to provide good deep imagery  but what a lame ending! The end of the movie just seems to implode on itself. This film has got to be one of the goofiest movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to try to explain it. The misogyny of this film is painful as well. If you are looking for a bad 50s sci-fi film to laugh at (aka 'bot fodder)  go for it. Otherwise  look for better films.,negative
In all honesty  I haven't seen this film for many years  but the few times I have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory  as anyone who has seen it will understand. I first saw it as a child at a YMCA Halloween party in the early Sixties  and it scared the hell out of us kids  in a fun way. I remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze. I can't risk giving away the ending  except to say that it was surprising  to say the least. I remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler  followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed. The ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history  and yet oddly moving  in a way. You have to see it for yourself  which is not easy these days. I don't know if it's available on home video or not  but it would still make a great Halloween feature for both kids and adults.,negative
I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life. Date Movie. That was bad. But this...this is just...it's not good. House Party 4 is the worst movie ever. It's as simple as that. It's basically Ferris Bueller with black people in it. Oh  and it's not funny. It's awful. So awful. Chris Stokes may be a superstar on BET  but he's an idiot. He can't write a comedy. Or a horror movie. I like to refer to him as a blacker  lesser-known Uwe Boll. Except Uwe Boll's films are funny awful  if you know what I mean. You can invite some buddies over  pop in Alone In The Dark  and have a great time laughing and eating snacks with your buddies. Chris Stokes is like that  except if you invite friends over to watch House Party 4 with you  no one will be laughing. Not even the biased token black guy or the illiterate jock. I'm serious  I didn't laugh once throughout this whole movie. The acting is terrible  and the movie looks like a bad indie film. What was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? I mean  what the hell? This movie just sucks; don't waste your time with this crap. It's disgusting.,negative
I'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. Even though Marques Houston did appear in HP3  he played a totally different character (he was  eight years older) in this film. Okay...so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinked--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name. And I'm sorry...Kym Whitley is not funny  and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris  Ketty Lester  or DC Curry in the earlier films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion...I have to give this a THUMBS DOWN!! Just naming the film Down to the Last Minute would have been OK. Furthermore  the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film.,negative
Watching this movie  you just have to ask: What were they thinking? There are so many noticeably bad parts of this movie  you might get the feel that its intentionally poor  as some sort of joke.<br /><br />I think the worst part about the film is the directing. There are so many bad uses of camera angles and other cinematic elements in this movie that are laughably bad. The funniest example of this would be in the beginning where the party guests are receiving their invitations by email - The same camera angle is used for each shot (which last an awkward 2 seconds a piece) and the same computer screen with the same desktop/window/program etc appear. It even looks like the thing is shot on the same set each time. The whole sequence was also completely silent  with no music  or sound effects. Overall  it was a poor way to convey the idea that an email was being sent all over town.<br /><br />If you listen closely  you may notice that the music sounds very similar to other movie sound tracks. This is no surprise- most songs  including the one that opens the movie  are in fact slight alterations of scores from other movies (See if you can guess which ones). Also  I noticed that the music is not played by a real orchestra. It sounds like its been written and played through a low end midi keyboard. If you are familiar with the LucasArts SCUM adventure games  the timbre of each instrument sounds like something from the IMUSE engine.<br /><br />Everything else about the movie just plain sucks. The acting is terrible. The script is derivative (Ferris Beuller?). There is no joke in the movie remotely funny  unless you see the whole film as one big joke  being played on a paying audience. Don't rent this. Don't even watch it when it's rerun on comedy central. Just forget this - it's terrible.,negative
I too am a House Party Fan...House Party I is my favorite movie of all times. House Party 4 is a disgrace to all of the HP's and to Kid n Play...This was supposed to be part of a series really..there was nothing about kid n play in this movie or any of the other veterans..yea kid n play was probably too old to be throwing a House Party movie b/c its kind of focused on teens..but kid n play could have at least made a cameo appearance ... you can tell how good it was b/c it didn't even make it to the movie theaters. Immature was in House Party 3 so it made sense for them to carry on the legacy...but they should have represented right...they should have left it at House Party 3. I am 27 years old and I have been watching House Party I since I was 11 when it came out in 1990(16 years ago) and I have been a fan ever since. When I first seen House Party 4 I was like what are they really thinking about...There was nothing familiar about this movie that would compare to the previous 3 movies.. I thought it was a black Ferris Bueller days off.,negative
I saw House Party 1-3 and I loved them but this one wasn't funny at all.First it can't be a House Party movie without Kid n'Play right? This one sucks and it was more like a black version of Ferris Bueller's Day Off than a House Party movie.Second who the heck is John-John?These new character's can't even compare to the ones from the other three movies.Now i know why they put it straight to video.It has horrible music  weak plot  untalented actors and no hilarious jokes at all.My advice watch this movie at night only if you can't get to sleep.They should have ended the series after House Party 3 since Kid'n'Play separated after that one.I hate this one am glad my local video store doesn't have this film and never want to buy it or want to see it on Comedy Central either.Just because Chris Strokes has talent managing an up-and-coming R&B group doesn't mean he has talent directing and producing films am I right or what? Finally  the female characters were all dressed up like cheap two-dollar hookers throughout most of the flick.IMX separated a year after this flick got released probably due to the failure of this film and are all but forgotten nowadays. In simplier terms this movie just plain old sucks!!!!,negative
"I've never saw the first three  but I know they're all better than this...trash. It's about some kid who throws a party. Wow. Sounds amazing(sarcasm). Is it? NOOO! It starts off with a kid laying in bed and he's getting woke up by his mom. So  the kid pretends to be sick so he doesn't have to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house and rounds up some people and throws a party. I didn't laugh at all while watching this trash. I can't imagine someone sitting down and writing down this dialogue thinking Man, dis !@#$ is gunna be big, yo! Makes me wonder if they even had a script for this movie. I watched this knowing it would be bad  but usually watching a bad movie makes me feel good because it gives me something to make fun of. This just disgusted me. TWO THUMBS DOWN!",negative
Artificial melodrama with a screenplay adapted by Mel Dinelli from his play The Man concerns a boarding-house proprietress taking in a troubled handyman who may be homicidal. Despite solid work from Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan (both trying their best)  this tedious yarn isn't very inventive within its one primary set (which quickly becomes visually dull) and underpopulated cast of characters (there is however a smart pooch who senses the worst!). Hokey and humorless  with a stilted direction from Harry Horner (perhaps Lupino should have directed?). Where's all the suspense promised by the ads? Dinelli also served as a co-producer. *1/2 from ****,negative
(Spoilers Ahead!) This same exact plot from this movie has been done before. It has been done in Ferris Bueller's Day Off! Marques Bat Man Houston plays sick. His gullible parents believe him. His sister knows that he's faking  but she still must go to school! She is mad. He has a party with his friends while his parents are away. By the time his parents get home  he is sick again and his parents never found out about the party. I like Immature better when they were in House Party 3 and still immature!,negative
I know it sounds crazy but yes  I am a huge fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it!!). I hated part 3  and then here comes part 4. I was like are you kidding me with this? Kid 'n Play are nowhere to be found in this movie  and that would've been okay  had they not foolishly entitled the movie House Party 4  as if it was in any way  shape  form  or fashion related to its predecessors. Every time this movie comes on late at night on USA  I shoot my TV with a rifle. Quite frankly  it really is just that atrocious. *hurling*<br /><br />As the only remaining fan of Kid 'n Play that will actually admit to being a fan (tee hee hee)  I was appalled. Remember that stupid little boy group Immature? They snuck their way into House Party 3. Okay  fine and well but how can part 4 be just about them and nothing else and it also seems like they're not even the same kids from part 3. *confused!!!!* House Party fans: do yourself a favor and stick to House Party 1 and 2 and Class Act. Beyond that  everything else is ridiculous.,negative
Sometimes it is funny to watch films implode from your couch  but other times it is just horribly painful to both your eyes and your mind. House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare examples of when both your eyes and your mind are pleading with you to turn the film off. This final installment to the House Party series is by far the worst  not just sequel  but film released by Hollywood. It becomes very apparent early on in this feature that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller's Day Off with a passion. I say this because it becomes very clear that Stokes had no trouble lifting the originality of Bueller off John Hughes' hands and choosing to create a film completely void of humor. You would think that by stealing themes and images from a funnier film  your own film would at least be able to generate a giggle or two. With House Party 4  Stokes proved that he does not have what it takes to direct a sequel  much less a Hollywood film. From his confusing and choppy story  the inability to make sense of his characters  and recycled old/tired cliché moments  all Stokes is doing is hitting a bigger nail into the coffin that holds the House Party films. It reminds me of that student that forgets about his project due in an hour and quickly slops together super glue  macaroni  cat hair  chewing gum  and straws and presents it as Hannibal Crossing the Alps. It just looks horrible and you feel embarrassed for the creator.<br /><br />So  where did this film first take the plunge into the realm of comic stupidity? Honestly  I do not think that most places will allow me to speak that long  so instead I would like to hit upon some of the larger topics that hit me the hardest. To begin  I still cannot shake the Ferris Beuller rip-off. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to direct another sequel to House Party and decided to bring in a completely random formula (from a funnier film) and see if he could cut and paste elements from the original series into that formula. That was a huge mistake. When a director tries to do this  what eventually happens is confusion within the audience. We think that we are going in one direction  but instead we head in another one. That is exactly what you can witness in House Party 4. In one instance we have John-John trying to have the biggest party of the decade while also trying to score a record deal (ok  kinda reminds me of the original House Party)  but then we whisk away to this random island where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying  Grandma gets drunk  and some idiotic mind-dulling moments with a supposed killer. Again  we begin somewhat strong  and end chaotic. This is the confusion in which I speak. Director Stokes did not have the ability to keep his hand on either the pulse of humor or the ability to tell a sequential story. He would rather cut corners  keep the jokes cheap  and think that the audiences are idiots than attempt to revive a stone-dead series. One would think that when a director was handed that task of filming another House Party film he would walk into it thinking that he/she would be the one to revive it or bring it back to life  instead Stokes just wanted to get paid.<br /><br />I realize that I am slowly growing older as the days go quickly by  but I do believe I still keep my hand in the younger generation's culture. I listened to rap and R&B growing up  but the group Immature never made it to either my cassette deck or my CD player. Why? I don't think they ever quite had a following  but apparently to director Chris Stokes  it would be beneficial to cast them as leads in his new House Party film. Didn't anyone at any studio realize that this was going to be in the red rather quickly? Or how about the option to have Stokes himself play the comedic car repairman  nothing like a director with no sense of comic timing casting himself as the only source of possible humor. It was one of those few instances when I actually missed Robin Harris  and I never thought I would find myself saying that to any film. Outside of a go-nowhere band playing the lead role  I also thought that the remainder of the cast only continued to suck the life out of this film. Uncle Charles was annoying when he attempted humor. Kim Whitely was completely wasted for her scenes (both literally and figuratively) while  well  everyone else pretty much falls into that category.<br /><br />Where did Chris Stokes spend most of the budget for this film? Not for special guest stars because while this film may have boasted some  there were definitely none present at the unforgettable House Party  nor the possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make one final appearance. House Party 4 followed no preset design  which ultimately ruined this feature from the foundation down. Can anyone explain to me why there was any need to use the escaped murderer who happened to be a licensed taxicab driver routine for humor? Stokes was reaching deep within the bottom of the barrel and only produced more muck instead of substance. For once I can admit to there being no redeeming value to this film. House Party 4 buried the series  and while I do hear that there may be more in the pipeline  I only hope Hollywood realizes that this series has died. Hollywood needs to let this series end  forget about the past and move forward in the future. I think a sequel to Who's the Man? would get them started in the right direction.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****,negative
A long time ago  way back in the early '80s  a late-night TV show Fridays came to ABC  trying to steal the limelight away from NBC's badly-listing Saturday Night Live. It didn't but it did introduce some repugnant sketches and semi-talented comedians to the world. Like Mark Blankenfield  for example.<br /><br />Which  in a roundabout way  brings us to Jekyll and Hyde... Together Again. Which is repugnant in ways all its own.<br /><br />Blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee cushions going off after Communion. And about as tasteful  too. This is just his drugged-out druggist character he played on the ill-fated Fridays show stretched out to feature length. And if you didn't like him there  why are you reading this review?<br /><br />Any time it takes more than one or two writers to write a movie  that's a bad sign. Then when it goes for dunder-headed jokes that would get you thrown off every improv stage in the Western hemisphere and replaces gags with gross-out  things can only get worse.<br /><br />A comic take on a Robert Louis Stevenson story? About as good an idea as making a sitcom out of Poe's Fall of the House of Usher.<br /><br />Aside from a few (VERY few) gags that give a slight grin  this whole film is an exercise in waste - wasted actors  wasted film  wasted opportunities.<br /><br />No wonder they showed original author Stevenson turning in his grave. What more observant a review could they give themselves?<br /><br />No stars. No  not even for Armstrong  who should have known better. <br /><br />Hyde from this one.,negative
"I did not quite get Barnens O  it is one of the weirdest ones I have watched. The soundtrack was quite unusual as well  written and performed by Jean Michel Jarre - it makes the movie weirder than it was. I have to admit that I was almost going to change it and watch another one instead at times the movie seemed plain dumb to me  or boring  or confusing. There are quite a few sexual references in that movie  trough they too are kind of messed up . Probably the only phrase that I will remember out of it is going to be When you are alone, you can control things  and I will show them - or something like that .The boy in that movie was obsessed with the idea of not growing up  the last summer as a child he thought once  and he sure lived it to the max. So if you have few hours to spare you can watch this movie  but you won't miss much if you don't.",negative
I didn't really care for this. Had they gotten rid of the comedy/slapstick and focused on the dramatic/philosophical aspects of the script  this might have been worthwhile.<br /><br />The more the film went on  the less I liked the protagonist/mailman. He does have interesting things to say  but he's also a hypocritical  insecure jerk.<br /><br />3/10,negative
I don't know what the makers of this film were trying to either accomplish or say  but they badly failed at whatever it was. Unless of course the object was to totally confuse the viewer. I watched this movie simply because Drew Barrymore was in it  and it turned out that she had a smaller than small cameo in it. The whole idea of having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet up with all sorts of wackos is utterly ridiculous.,negative
I'm not going to say too much as this movie isn't worth the effort. To put it simply the movie absolutely sucked! This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The storyline was stupid  you couldn't follow what was happening  the characters were so annoying especially the main guy. I wanted someone to kill that kid and put him and the movie out of it's misery.<br /><br />Very  very bad.,negative
Some movies are off-beat  but enjoyable  but many movies are just mind-numbingly weird. Motorama fits not-so-nicely in the latter category. Many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense  but those two things can only take a movie so far  and Motorama simply doesn't have any other merits to its credit.<br /><br />Motorama delights itself on plot improbabilities. Its main character  Gus  is a cussing 10-year old on a roadtrip across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces to win $500 million. When interacting with adult figures  none of them seem to notice or be concerned with the fact that he's 10 years old. At first it's incredibly funny  but it quickly becomes just too unbelievable  especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so unfazed by a lot of the disturbing (to someone that age) imagery going on around him. Gus has no depth  and  as an anti-hero who has no problem causing misery for others to get his game pieces  it's hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters trouble.<br /><br />That trouble is provided by a slew of guest appearances  each mistreating Gus in more and more strange ways. Besides making the already worn-out plot even more unbelievable and less enjoyable  the characters share Gus' lack of depth and are equally unmemorable. The character's actions can get a little interesting  but the actors themselves don't add anything to them  thus negating the whole point of getting big names (they could've been played by anyone and the character would've been the same). These guest appearances seem to have been signed more for marquee value than anything else.<br /><br />Motorama should be interesting - it's a unique idea  but there's too little semblance of sense in the script for it to work. Incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti-hero and the viewer don't  as the movie quickly moves from incident to incident  in the hope that something will eventually make the audience feel sorry or understanding for Gus. That never happens  as by doing so nothing is allowed to connect  it just jerks back and forth as if on a conveyor belt  one incident after another. With a story so nonsensical it ceases to be enjoyable  and a main character who never evolves to care for himself or anyone else on a higher level  Motorama has little to offer except a brat sneaking around and trying to get rich. Why should we care about that?,negative
The only reason this movie is not given a 1 (awful) vote is that the acting of both Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan is superb. Ida Lupino who is lovely  as usual  becomes increasingly distraught as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman. Robert Ryan is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character  guided only by his disturbed mind  changes from one minute to the next. Seemingly simple and docile  suddenly he becomes clever and threatening. Ms. Lupino's character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along. She could not manage to get out of her of her own house: windows didn't open  both front and back doors locked and unlocked from the inside with a key. You could not have designed a worse fire-trap if you tried. She did not take the precaution of having even one extra key. Nor could she figure out how to summon help from nearby neighbors or get out of her own basement while she was locked in and out of sight of her captor. I don't know what war her husband was killed in  but if it was World War II  the furnishings in her house  the styles of the clothes  especially the children and the telephone company repairman's car are clearly anachronistic. I recommend watching this movie just to see what oddities you can find.,negative
This oddity contains Bunuel-like touches  but doesn't sustain one's interest. A 10 year old roams a bizarro America in a stolen Mustang  while the usual cult movie suspects (Dick Miller  Mary Woronov  Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. Like his AFTER HOURS and VAMPIRE'S KISS  the screenwriter delights in making you squirm. I remained unaffected  due to the broad acting. You know you're in for it when Meat Loaf and Flea give the most appealing perfs. (And what did this kid's screen test look like? He's insufferable.) Recommended to the dozen or so fans of SONNY BOY ('87).,negative
Sigh. I'm baffled when I see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot. I saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards. It was mildly annoying to see it swiping the Grinch Who Stole Christmas heart gag along with the narration  the set design seen many times before  the whole weak Tim Burton-ish style  and the story that goes nowhere. And we got the joke about shooting the crows with the 45 the first time  alright?<br /><br />But I guess what's really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa 1999 called LENORE  THE CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge! As any quick internet search will reveal. I mean  what is this? This is what they base a Hollywood contract on and opens doors in Canada for a filmmaker? Give your head a shake as Don Cherry might say.,negative
You may like Tim Burton's fantasies  but not in a commercial-like show off lasting 8 minutes. It demonstrates good technical points without real creativity or some established narrative pace.,negative

Give your head a shake as Don Cherry might say.,negative
The movie uses motifs that could be plagiarized from Wait Until Dark (1967)  a much better movie by Terence Young  starring Audrey Hepburn. Dead Silent is a pale paraphrase. There is nothing new here -- the hidden object in the doll  the bad men wanting it  the bad guy posing as a good guy. The disability  though  has shifted : Audrey Hepburn couldn't see  the child in DS cannot speak. But both stories hinge on the handicap. Where Wait Until Dark built up unbearable suspense  Dead Silent lets you guess the outcome  the story being such a stereotype.,negative
"Julia Kerbridge (Catherine Mary Stewart) is working hard to become a doctor. Suddenly, Julia finds herself the guardian of her young niece, Amanda, after her parents are found murdered. Julia has a new neighbor, the mysterious Kevin Finney (Rob Lowe). Her hectic life comes crashing down when it becomes apparent that the young Amanda holds the key to a terrible secret. For she too is now the target of the killers. Julia must discover whether Kevin is friend or foe, and unlock the sinister mystery before the murderer strikes again, according to the DVD sleeve synopsis.<br /><br />This thriller quietly falls apart at the seams  but it is interesting some of the time. Stalker Sean Devine's background telephone scene (outside the police station) and Mr. Lowe's violin (restaurant) are tensely played. But  early on  it's difficult not to miss the fact that one of the supposedly sophisticated killers purposely twists his foot in some red paint at the murder scene. Unfortunately  this is not an intricate plot point; and  there are worse story stumbles afoot. Overall Dead Silent is not a bad way to spend some time  if there is nothing better on  or you're into Lowe and his co-stars.<br /><br />**** Dead Silent (1999) Roger Cardinal ~ Catherine Mary Stewart  Rob Lowe  Arlen Aguayo-Stewart  Larry Day",negative
Rob Lowe must have eaten up the entire budget  but I can't fault him for running with the money. Even he would have to agree  there was nothing good about this movie. Filming  editing  direction  dialogue  sets  makeup  writing  casting (especially the young girl and imposter child psychiatrist)  and the story all were just the worst. I have never seen such a horrible movie. Pass this one up for any other rental selection  or find yourself shouting out vile comments at the TV. Dead Silent should be silenced for all time.,negative
The first 4 episodes of season 6 are just to throw up  to predictable and the worst scenario i've seen. Won't and hopefully i din't buy it. Also seen in seasons back that episodes about space they did  suck even more. All i want to say to the people who make this is: don't do whole episode about space  because they suck. The point is that season 6 sucks even more than the seasons before. Gets worse from season to season. I got so disappointed and frustrated watching first 4 episodes of season 6 that i just had to write this. Only people who are brain washed can watch this crap. Seems that people writing the scenario are getting out of ideas for a long time. Think that my 2 year old nephew had a better idea for the episode than these people do.,negative
people  get a clue! I mean  the writers dont have one  so I would expect you to...this show is SUCH a pale imitation of the '60 show that you can laugh at it! and the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects  and is in B&W fer Chrissakes! Yet the mood and the writing on the old show is MILES ahead of this drivel. Get HiP kids! if 98 Degrees or Brittany told you to watch it  you would! You know it! Just bypass them and tell all your friends you were 'IN' with the 'scene' BEFORE it became too cool!,negative
o dear god i suffered having to watch this film FOUR times in my sisters house and was it dreadful a story of sex and guns and very cheap unexplained acting unless you are at gunpoint being told to watch this avoid it Ja Rule just proved he cannot act Ving Rhames also gave the most dreadful acting ever in any of his films there was not one part of this film made me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotion i would be surprised people actually enjoyed this i have seem some dreadful films in my life but this would be in my five worst films ever the music in it wasn't good and the storyline i think was made up by a couple of guys who ordered a pizza and just sat down wrote ten bullet points and then made it into a film absolutely dreadful,negative
Beware  My Lovely (1952) Dir: Harry Horner <br /><br />Production: The Filmmakers/RKO Radio Pictures<br /><br />Credulity-straining thriller from the pioneering producer team of Collier Young and Ida Lupino  aka The Filmmakers (with Lupino pitching in with some uncredited direction). <br /><br />Robert Ryan is the 'peril' and Ida Lupino is the 'woman' in this entry in the 'woman in peril' style film. Ryan plays Howard Wilton  a tightly-wound psychotic handyman drifter (noooo  Ryan? I know  hard to believe). Lupino is the lonely war widow  Helen Gordon  who hires Howard to do some work around her house. Things go downhill from there as Howard makes Helen a prisoner in her own home. <br /><br />Howard has a nasty secret  not that he could reveal it. You see  consciousness is a real challenge for him. Maintaining it  that is. He has an unfortunate habit of coming to and finding his employers dead. This is part of the film's problem. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is nearly impossible to believe that he's been free to roam from town to town unobstructed  even in the year 1918 (when the film is set). He can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. His violent  threatening  anti-social tendencies are set off by the smallest and most common of things (a young girl flirting  inadequacies involving the war  due to his being rejected for service). I don't know how he even made it past the interview with Helen. There are other implausibilities. If you were locked in your house with a madman  but nonetheless left on your own for periods of time  couldn't you figure out a way to escape? <br /><br />Ryan  I think  is defeated by the material. It feels like he's overplaying his hand. His series of tics and spasms and the tightly coiled bursts of dementia all have a been-there  done-that robotic feel to them. At this point in his career he'd probably played this character  to some degree  ten times and it shows. We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (I didn't) through shown bits of humanity  like him being stopped in his tracks by a music box and his relating to a group of children who won't judge him. Lupino just has to act frazzled and in distress  which she is more than capable of and does. <br /><br />The picture had one thing going for it; what would be the eventual resolution of the conflict? So naturally there was a disappointing ending that was abrupt and ineffective. <br /><br />Of slight interest was a recurring motif where the camera would catch Howard's reflection (in mirrors  water  Christmas tree decorations). This indicated something going on  or about to go on  in his head. Horner (1953's Vicki)  who made his reputation in production design  does a fine job of making the house feel like a prison. Credit too  the always reliable RKO art department for the work on the house. In the end  sub-standard work from the principals  who all have much better films to their credit. <br /><br />*½ out of 4,negative
It is difficult to rate a writer/director's first effort. After all  it is one more movie than I have written or directed. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting  but suffered from an uneven flow.<br /><br />After all  the idea that a man (Ja Rule) has to choose between the thug life and going straight is common  and even falling in love with the daughter (Tatyana Ali) of the man you killed has been done. Doing it again demands something that is original  and originality is lacking in this film.<br /><br />I was drawn by the inclusion of so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Trues Lies  Wayne's World)  Pam Grier (Jackie Brown)  Frank Langella (Dracula  Good Night and Good Luck)  and Ving Rhames (Rosewood  Dawn of the Dead). They did not disappoint in their performances  but they had little to work with.<br /><br />Direct to video is becoming more and more common  but that doesn't mean it has to be a waste of time. Maybe the sophomore effort of Hunter will be more enjoyable.,negative
"Why did I buy this movie on DVD?  Well the short answer would be: I really don't know. As for the longer version  it pretty much comes down to the fact that I genuinely like Tatyana Ali and she plays Alicia in this.<br /><br />Now does Tatyana Ali give a genuinely good effort in this movie? I must say that it is one of the better  and she is shaping up to be a rather decent actress. I am very much looking forward to see her in action  when better material will be available.<br /><br />This being said  this movie was terrible - and my score is given based on this: 1 star for not being the worst movie I've seen  1 star for the performance of Tatyana Ali  and 1 star for not thinking that it only deserves 2 stars  there are worse movies for that.<br /><br />Ja Rule should stick to rapping  not my favourite rapper to say the least  but some seem to like him - and if he is contained there  I would be delighted not to see him contaminate the acting scene.<br /><br />Ving Rhames: Ah man  Marcellus Wallace what are you doing here - you used to be cool man. Just because Michael Caine is a fiercely brilliant actor  who has been in so many terrible flicks as well as good  you don't have to copy him Ving.<br /><br />The rest of the semi big names in the cast: It's OK  there are bills to be paid  and we all have to do things we're not proud of time to time.<br /><br />The movie itself. It so massively flawed  it's pretty difficult to know where to start. It's more like a bunch of scenes thrown in together  as were the director to say we need to tell this, and we need to tell that. There is a story  unfortunately there is nothing surprising about or within it. To say the least  the plot changes in the story were overly obvious and it was therefore predictable what was going to happen all the time.<br /><br />To sum up in one word: Reallynotgood",negative
I'm usually a fan of art and foreign films  but when I saw this one my reaction was it must be called experimental because it makes no sense. The action is static  while at the same time it bounces from one location to another. There aren't enough titles to make it clear who is who and what their relationships are. Apparently the main point was to show that in the face of murder  adultery and generally weird and dissolute behavior  the cure offered by the powers that be is to banish a totally innocent black man.,negative
"This experimental silent film  made in Switzerland by an independent British film company  is chiefly remembered as Paul Robeson's first film. It's very artistic  with shots often seeming meaningless to the story  which is difficult to understand anyway because of the lack of enough inter-titles. From what I gathered  Robeson's wife  Adah  is in an inter-racial love affair with a white man called Thorne. It doesn't bother the cigar-chomping owner of the bar/hotel where Thorne lives (and she seems to be having a lesbian relationship with a barmaid)  but an old lady expresses the town's point of view in an inter-title: If I had my way, we wouldn't allow negroes in here. Thorne is also called nigger lover by someone in the bar. Adah tries a reconciliation with Pete (Robeson)  but eventually leaves him. Thorne's wife  Astrid  goes off the deep end  brandishes a knife  cuts Thorne's arm and cheek  and somehow dies. Thorne must have been accused of murder because we learn he was acquitted. As for Pete  he gets a letter from the mayor telling him it is best for everyone that he leave town. So the film is more about racism than anything  but in an up note  the owner tells Pete The sad thing is, they think they're right. That's the way we are. The meaning of the title is a mystery. It may refer to Adah being light-skinned (a borderline negro) or to the borderline behavior of of the main characters.",negative
This film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life  especially love which he has not had a taste of for 5 years.<br /><br />It basically is a film featuring a man with very poor social skills  and he says wrong things all the time. The plot is hollow and contrived. The main character  James  is lonely  but this theme of loneliness is not adequately explored. It is more like an empty statement which other subplots stem from. Sadness and disappointment after being dumped are superficial. There is a serious lack of emotions in the film.<br /><br />It is not funny as a comedy either. There are some funny one liners but that is it. It lacks the happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with happy mood. I don't find I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With funny.,negative
This is absolutely awful. It's everywhere & nowhere & doesn't have any sort of point. I have never understood what is good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is so above this drivel she must have been personal friends w/people involved because there is no way she would have read any part of this so-called script & thought  Yeah I wanna do that! Most movies I can find at least one or two things that are redeemable or funny. There is ZERO of that in this. It's extremely dumb. There really isn't any other word to describe this. This is quite possibly the biggest waste of money on making of film that I have seen in a long time. Skip this at all cost  you'll be glad you did.,negative
How i deserved to watch this crap??? Worst ever. The acting was awful  when i read that this was a comedy i expected at least to smile  once - or twice  but.... If you are wiling to loose hour and a half of your lives  this is the right movie. I recommend just look in a wall or something  anything else but watch this film. Yoy can even watch a documentary (if you are a guy) about pregnant women  i guarantee it will be more entertaining :)The actor in this one (i forgot his name) is not that bad  and i am surprised how hi accepted the role. Anyway I want someone to eat cheese with is the right film if you want to punish someone.,negative
this film has no plot  no good acting  to be honest it has nothing  the same songs play over and over awful acting and if you can actually sit there and watch the whole thing and enjoy it there is something wrong with you. I wish i could give this 0 out of 10 but i cant so it has to be a 1 which is generous! ice-t isn't even a good rapper and even worse at acting  every bit of the film is rubbish  i got this film on DVD without knowing what it was for the price of £1.99 and thought that i had picked up a bargain  i then looked at the IMDb rating and didn't take it into consideration but after watching it found out that the DVD i had bought was a complete waste of time  money and electricity. if you have this film there are two things you can do sell it to someone who doesn't know about it or burn it!,negative
Great ensemble cast but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag. One feels not fulfilled at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion  closure  or at least an ironic twist.<br /><br />It had that familiar Curb feel without dare I say it  Larry as the annoying polar opposite. The music was there  the 'show about nothing' scenes pop up  but without any common thread or suspense - it falters as a solo project that ran out of budget.<br /><br />Spoilers: The movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice pudding. Is cheese a better selling title than rice pudding? He prefers just any junk food  regardless of the sell by date. Maybe I want someone to eat 'cheese-dogs' or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes together.<br /><br />Marty: this is just not funny and overdone. People just don't care about a 'show' within a show. A coffee book table about coffee books was funnier.<br /><br />Unless you are big fans of the cast  save your time and eat some cheese. It doesn't even have to be with anyone.,negative
"As a recent convert to Curb Your Enthusiasm  which prompted my viewing of all season's episodes  I expected more  much more from Jeff's efforts.<br /><br />When I view a film offering a slice of an average 'Joe's' life I need reasons to be interested  to care  to feel and believe. And with Jeff Garlin at the helm I also expected a bevy of shining comedic moments. This film failed me time and again.<br /><br />Jeff plays a living with mom  plump sad sack who is a social disaster. He has not had a relationships  real or even casual  for many years. He appears to be mostly unemployed and  as noted  shacks with his mommy dearest. Can things get worse? Sure. In short order he gets sacked by everyone around him including Silverman  Second City (his comedy workshop) and his agent. All reinforce his 'loser' status. Silverman's 'fatty' experiment was as cruel as it was absurd. His obsession with the role of Marty, as the means of his career's salvation  also hits a big dead end.<br /><br />While the film's final moments offer a glimpse of better things to come the cinematic 'journey ' albeit with occasional golden glimmers  was sadly lacking.",negative
When they announced this movie for TNT I was excited. A Travesty from Donald Westlake's Enough was one of my all time favorite stories. After I watched it I was not all that thrilled. Recently I had the chance to watch it a second time with my aunt  and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it much either  and she'd never read the book). In this movie they managed to sap all the charm from the book and turn it into dull mush. A big part of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him fine in other films  but he played (Terry/Carey) Thorpe as a stammering  incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes a lot of valium for his nerves  but remains outwardly collected at almost all times which is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a big part of the story (other than a 2 second glimpse at the embassy)  where Thorpe solves not 1 but 4 homicides for the police. This is important not just because it's funny  but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the movie Fred's betrayal in the end is not nearly as affecting  because they don't seem all that close. In the book they become pretty good friends especially on Fred's side  which makes it all the more ironic that he is he one that arranges Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit from casting  I love Adam Arkin but he was not a cheerful  happy to be alive upbeat sort of Detective  character traits which book Fred possesses which makes it more obviously out of character for him to mess with evidence and thus more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were pretty close to the book  and James Cromwell was great despite not looking much like Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene which was entirely added for the film was much less interesting than the police finding Edgarson's body after Thorpe ships it to Seattle and blaming the death on the mob. Kit was okay although she was mostly rewritten  and it would have been nice to see her die as she did get slightly annoying. I don't mind changes to books to make movies  I know they are necessary because of length and difficulty  but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this movie had been funnier or smarter instead of duller.,negative
this film is an undisguised attempt to appeal to a younger demographic of fourteen to 24 yr olds'  and an insult to all of them. i refuse to believe that that age group is that vapid as to be entertained by this unnecessary remake. early in the film one of the characters proclaims  i am surrounded by idiots. this is the defining moment in the film  which goes steadily down from there. full of clichés  red-herring scares and unexplained events  the film is also full of characters who are not exactly brainiacs  a formula all too familiar in dumb horror movies. and that crappy it's so dark i cant see scenes stolen from Chainsaw Massacre but merely annoying  not building any tension  nor horror. it's difficult to film in the dark  and sometimes darkness is a great vehicle in a film that's suppose to have tension. but my own feeling was that the less you see in this case  the better. maybe he didn't want to wait until morning because he didn't care  other than it might cost him more money to do night scenes well  or he doesn't know how. who knows? unless you have never seen a horror film in your life  or you are two or three years old  every aspect of this film is predictable and done before. warning: Paris Hilton is in this movie. enough said. all in all a blasé slasher film which begs the question  where the h*ll is the wax?it was treated like a lost leader. if you're bored as possible and all other rentals are out or you're just in the mood for a bad horror film  which isn't really scary or you'd like to see Paris have a pole smash through her head  go ahead and take a chance. it's not the worst movie i've ever seen  but if this is what the producers of this film thinks a younger audience wants  i pray that they are deluded. a profit-driven film with no attempt to achieve any kind of art nor respect for the genre. you know  smart characters make for a scarier movie. i believe this is Collet-Serra's debut as a director  besides commercials and music videos. he has another one coming out in 2006 called Goal 2. hopefully his goal is to make a better film.,negative
Ignore the extreme votes about House of Wax  in no way is it either a 1 or a 10. I will try to be of help to anyone thinking about seeing House of Wax or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie look very promising  which is what trailers are supposed to do. There is only one thing for sure with trailers  if the producers can't cobble together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer  it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck-fest. But a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good  it does not give you much idea about the total package. Here a little research can be valuable. <br /><br />House of Wax stars Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than to either her fellow Canadian Sarah Polley or her lookalike Rose McGowen)  and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as Jaume  in his feature debut. These are not good signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of Production Designer Grace Walken  who was responsible for the look of Ghost Ship. Once again Walken's work is worth seeing  so much so that it looks like 90% of the movie's $30 million budget went to production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film (finger cut off  lips glued shut  tied up  and lots of wading around in assorted gooey stuff). By-the-bye  Cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in The Girl Next Door  about one big pig-out away from having a major weight problem.<br /><br />Which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew. And judging from the what was on the screen  this might actually be true. It looks like everyone else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit. Unfortunately  whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the pay disparity  the contributions of all these inexperienced/incompetent volunteers amount to less than zero.<br /><br />Inexperienced Steven Window's DP work was about as awful as you are likely to see and working in league with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert Pearl Harbor here) they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group. Rather than linger over and showcase the sets  Window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky-zooming-bobbing camera work. Negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting  an ADD-like camera  and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when the movie's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets.<br /><br />Chan Hayes did the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity. One saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody (insert Van Helsing here). The murders are played for laughs  too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six. The audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar  although her earlier half-baked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film. Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guy.<br /><br />The good scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax  a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill  conjoined twins  and a lot of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets to bathe in). All this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural Florida although from the many hills it sure looks like Paul Hogan's country (attention location scouts-the gulf coast is not noted for it's rolling terrain). The screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins  but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed. Since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere  you wonder why it wasn't also cut to reduce the boredom factor.<br /><br />What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid-production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic-even with the existing cast. What was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax. Because it is a photographic medium  modern film is intrinsically naturalistic  almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality. Here they had a ready-made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting  the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close. Of course they would have had to find a visionary Director and DP to bring the thing off successfully  but everything else was already in place for this to happen.,negative
"The third film based on Charles Belden's play entitled Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933) targets generation X-tasy. Twin screenwriters  Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes  spend more time developing the main characters than other slasher movies--a promising start. Their condition guarantees an authentic point of view. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not much of a stretch for the world's favorite heiress. She peruses In Style, stripteases boys  chats on a cell  and frets over an ill-conceived pregnancy. Her regular routine has been altered beyond repair. Hilton reached the peak of her performance--not so hot--during the 1 Night in Paris (2004) parody. While the pimp-my-ride is in motion  she zealously looks for lip balm in her boyfriend's (Robert Ri'chard) lap. Finally  the actress atones for using the N word on the sex tape. Director Jaume Collet-Serra molds his take on the twin thing contrary to the theme of the past. Each exhibited opposite characteristics back then  whereas a pair of either good or bad can come out the womb today. However  the latter does not rule out the former. Childbirth constitutes the luck of the draw. Spectators can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) a contemporary Quasimodo. Granted  the recluses share some similarities such as artistry  disfigurement  submissiveness  and murder. Yet  one small variable between the two makes all the difference. Vincent is even uglier on the inside than he is on the out. Collet-Serra's House of Wax pays homage to actor Vincent Price from the first remake in 1953. The film leaves obvious van Gogh puns to the imagination of the audience. Still  the choice to split the antagonist in two eliminates a vibrant twist at the end. Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod's unmasking receives runner-up  but the most terrifying one in horror movie history belongs to Lon Chaney in Phantom of the Opera (1925). As far as the new contender is concerned  the aftermath of separation surgery downplays the effect. A surgeon should know operating on Siamese twins scars them--physically and psychologically. Their father needs to call a couple colleagues--Dr. Phil to consult and Dr. McNamara to nip/tuck. Despite what the trailers said  Wax is not forever. In fact  you can rid yourself of it by burning it.",negative
A horrible  horrible  horrible film. I saw the original when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares into my teens. When I found out a remake was on the way  I groaned. WHY OH WHY remake a good film? Well  we can thank Dark Castle for buggering yet another classic horror film. This time they've replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore  slower than slow pacing  and yawn-inspired characters. Someone previously said that s/he was surprised that Paris Hilton can act. Uh  were you watching the film? She plays a prissy little tramp. Sounds like typecasting to me. Half of the people in the audience actually CHEERED when she died! That tells you why people are seeing this film. If that's your only reason  then find a better one  because like a black hole this thing will suck out more of your life than you'll want. Had I been alone  I would have left 10 minutes into the boring exposition. This thing is like a moron's guide to crap film-making: In bred Southern git  stupid but attractive leads  knives a plenty  gore a plenty  stock menacing truck  I could go on. After watching this film  I began to really appreciate Jeepers Creepers  and I thought that film sucked. Save yourself and avoid this crapfest at every cost.,negative
Is this a game FMV or a movie? In all honesty  I watched this one out of choice-less-ness. It is a very big waste of time and money.<br /><br />It seems HK movies are heading in the opposite direction of the rest of the world.<br /><br />Try to put more effort and money into a production and make us want to watch  rather than something you want us to watch.<br /><br />The graphics are so horrible than they looked like something out of the early to mid-90s low resolution games (in comparison to today's).<br /><br />The way they made this movie is almost exactly what they did in the 90s' Wing Commander game  namely the third installment of the series. Stop regressing and make us Asian look so bad at this compared to the big guns in Hollywood.<br /><br />Sure! They have big budgets and better actors. But we have some of the oldest histories  the myths and the legends  the best technophiles and possibly the largest computer graphic talent base in the world! So what went so very very wrong? Did you start using the same old companies that have been working with you for so many films?! Please stop wasting our time and money. This is the reason why HK movies are heading downhill so rapidly. Didn't you claim to be the Hollywood of the Orient? Guess not.,negative
It borrowed scenes from LOTR  Matrix  Star Wars  etc. The humor is so dry  contrived  and corny  that you can't help but laugh occasionally at its inanity and the fact that you are watching it. Exactly what you'd expect from an HK comedy. The average person would enter with an IQ of 100 and leave with less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious omission from this movie. The humor would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the Cantonese original. The graphics are poor compared to its Hollywood counterparts. There is overdependence on low quality CG. My biggest complaint is its ending. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in the Journey to the West (JW)  that this alternate explanation does not work well with story line. Despite its many flaws this movie has far more entertainment value than the other movie Nicholas Tse starred in--The Promise.,negative
First there was Tsui Hark's Zu Warriors (2001)  which is visually ground-breaking  but much lacking in the acting and writing departments  now this movie  which is visually almost as good as Zu (though no longer ground-breaking)  but is even worse in the acting and writing departments. It's really sad that there seems to be an almost complete lack of acting and writing talents in the HK movie industry. I guess you need to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogs in the movie really are. It's like some delinquent kids talking in the street  it's that bad. To make it worse  the actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent kids  and can't act even if their life depend on it. I understand that this movie is supposed to be a comedy aimed at the younger generation in HK  but has HK youths really become so brain-dead that they can't appreciate anything but such juvenile and vulgar acting/writing? If that's the case  it makes me ashamed to be from HK.<br /><br />I wish HK movie makers will learn some lessons from directors like Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee  and finally make a movie that's both visually stunning as well as competent and mature in the acting and writing departments. And stop using young singers/idols/heartthrobs as actors because they can't act however many fans they may have in HK!,negative
I quite enjoyed The Wrecking Crew (1999)  which was the last of the three films in this series (the first being Urban Menace (1999) which I've yet to see). I know it was baaaaad  but the three leads did a pretty decent job  all things considered.<br /><br />This  however  was truly atrocious. Ice-T was dreadful  and he's the producer! Can't say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who apparently never learnt how to spell)  but his performance was one of the worst I've ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />Miss Jones did pretty well in her small role  though she later went on to make some atrocious  racist jokes on her radio show after the SE Asian tsunami (plus other occasions sadly). Way to go  girl...<br /><br />No-one else comes out with any credit. Strangely  TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (who are both pretty bad here) are far better in The Wrecking Crew  which was made  along with Urban Menace  at the same time as Corrupt. How that works  I don't know.<br /><br />I'm going to try the Ice-T commentary now  to see whether he apologises for the film  or tries to make us think it's a great piece of film-making.,negative
"It's like someone took a fantasy-type video game and put it in a blender  and the resulting scene mishmash is what we have to sit through.<br /><br />Now let me go on record by saying how much I love Chinese fantasy films. From the fun and silly  to those focusing on martial arts  to the more dramatic and romantic typesit's a genre I very much enjoy. Films like A Chinese Odyssey: Pandora's Box and A Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella (both of which were written and/or directed by Jeffrey Lau); The Bride with White Hair; Butterfly & Sword; Green Snake; A Chinese Ghost Story; Swordman II; Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; and others. Which is why I was looking forward to A Chinese Tall Story. One of the film's characters is the Monkey King (aka Sun Wukong)  an extremely well-known character in Chinese mythology  first told in the stories of the Journey to the West, the epic adventure written about 500 years ago. (The story of the Monkey King and his disciples is also the focus of the Chinese Odyssey films  amongst many others). Other familiar characters that appear in the film are Zhu Wuneng (the pig character) and Sha Wujing.<br /><br />So how does it all go wrong? Well  let's take an example familiar to Western audiences. How about the Robin Hood mythology? A well known story from ye olden days. Let's say that our Robin Hood film starred Wesley Snipes as Robin Hood  and Haley Joel Osment as Friar Tuck. Maid Marian is none other than Rosie Perez. Let's give Sir Robin an Uzi as well  because you never know when you might have to waste the Sheriff of Nottingham. They might need rocket packs also  and while we're at it  give them a tactical nuclear weapon because that sure could come in handy. If you think this sounds like a really neat retelling of the Robin Hood tale  then A Chinese Tall Story is the movie for you! As I indicated above  this movie is a jumbled mess. In the first 30 minutes  we are introduced not only to Sun Wukong  Zhu Wuneng  and Sha Wujing  but also to the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist)  kidnapped children  a millennium bug demon (which shoots laser beams)  an underground Tree God  a lizard imp tribe  an angelic girl in an intergalactic egg  the Lord Chancellor Tortoise  a Sea Dragon King  a ever-morphing magic golden staff  a chatterbox imp girl  wormholes in space  and the Four Heavenly Knights. All this wouldn't be too bad--the tales and myths passed down over the years certainly do have all sorts of fantastical elements. But I guarantee you the Chinese mythology does not include much of the stuff we get subjected to in the last half of the film. (Helpful advice to the filmmakers: Just because your computer effects guys CAN come up with cool looking spaceships and depictions of intergalactic war  does not mean they SHOULD).<br /><br />You know your Chinese mythology movie is on the wrong track when the director asks (and I am not making this upit's a direct quote from the commentary) I asked the composer whether or not we can have a more rock-and-roll type music when she transforms into some kind of android-like thing. Is there a story hidden in here somewhere? Yes. Yes  there is. Most of the adventure follows Tripitaka (played by Nicholas TseGen-X Cops, Time and Tide, My Schoolmate the Barbarian) and Meiyan  the lizard imp girl (played by Charlene Choi and a computer). Choi is the best thing going in this film. You may know her as half of the Canto-pop group Twins and from other films such as The Twins Effect (a fun flick) and Just One Look (a surprisingly good drama/romance/comedy). Poor Choi  being a lizard imp and all  is hardly recognizable with her warts  snagged out teeth  doughy nose  and hunched back. That is until the computers get a hold of and beautify her  which somehow makes it worse. Tse is passable  but all of the supporting actors were abysmal. A couple of recognizable faces in bit parts are wasted.<br /><br />At one point I was debating with myself if A Chinese Tall Story was a spoof. I was almost able to convince myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by a very pretty Fan Bing-Bing) got out and lit up a Marlboro (!) while talking with Tripitaka who was practicing martial arts dressed in a Spider-Man costume (!!). But it is not a spoof. Of course there is the typical Hong Kong silliness  but the movie takes itself seriously enough  with enough scenes of romance and pathos (scored with a sledghammering of violins and evocative cellos) and rousing action and adventure.<br /><br />You might think that you could watch this on a Netflix rental and it wouldn't cost you anything. (Oh  but it'll cost you  all right).<br /><br />Is there anything good to say? Sure. The colors are vibrant (they are the best thing about this movie). And the filmmakers certainly were trying very hard. Too bad all that effort went into a movie that is not much more than a bad video game.",negative
"I was watching the beginning of this on a Friday  mid-day  while working at computer at home  relaxing a bit after a hectic week  and cleaning-up some files and answering some communications. Got interrupted a couple of times  so had trouble getting all the details straight (although it's hardly a work of Hitchcock proportions  where missing a detail can through the whole story off-kilter)  and besides it was not exactly an engrossing piece of work.<br /><br />So during a commercial  read the only prior comment here (by mgconlan-1)  and pretty much can agree with its details.<br /><br />Not quite in the category of a film so awful it is fascinatingly good, but I'd like to catch on tape when run again (rather than seeing it as aired)  so I can fast forward as needed and see the parts which I missed this first time.<br /><br />Give it a 3* because of the attractiveness of the four primary characters.",negative
I do not know what some of these filmmakers are thinking  by making the same type of clichéd film over and over  where the bad guys (bad girls in this case) win. Weak acting and very predictable. Nothing original about it. This same movie has been made over and over again- not different from GOODBYE LOVER (1989)  SLOW BURN (2005)  or at least ten other movies with the exact same storyline and ending. There are a lot of holes in the movie too. It is as if they ran out of money and just stopped filming. Or perhaps they ran out of ideas. But do not waste your time with this one. It will only leave you upset by having wasted your time watching it.,negative
I saw this movie considering this as a normal Hollywood movie but then came to know that its a Movie made for TV channel.On my DVD cover out of 2 critics comments one of the critic stephen farber from moviline reveiwed it as A best movie of the Year..<br /><br />All the character were simple and decent performances except the Brain's character which never gets scope which director wanted to keeps mystery till end.. there was suspense till end but when you see the end that lady Police Officer and main culprit had a Lesbian affair seems to be totally stupid idea.God knows what happens to DAVE the male lead character..<br /><br />The other Critic from Mr. Brown's Movies said that Shocking and Effective but doesn't quite live up to all the Hype... which i saw after watching the Movie .for which i was partially aggree...i should have read this first before taking the movie..,negative
All I can say is  this movie is made for the Lifetime Channel on TV  which means no solid characters  no particular style  weak acting all kinds of suggested sex but no-breasts and tushs (because boy  that would just catapult the film into the depths of sleaze wouldn't it?) but the heavily simulated sex  well  that's OK. <br /><br />When watching these films I have to ask myself  when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers ever grow up? I think these companies are actually way behind the times. They really have no clue what the younger generation is in tune with and if they knew they would demand we change. The whole point of many American TV channels like these seems mostly to regurgitate the same sanitized  diluded garbage over and over like a generic movie assembly line. I guess it works for them... or at least it has. Not sure about the future though. <br /><br />Don't bore yourself to death like I did. Seek out some real TV movies on HBO  Showtime  IFC  Starz  etc. Any channel that puts effort into their work and doesn't have to ask a priest what they can or cannot show.,negative
"The Lifetime channel aired this in October but I only got around to watching it now. It's the old eternal triangle again  small-town Connecticut boy Dave Ford (Matt Long) has a quick fling with his best friend's girlfriend  Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui)  on the eve of his departure for law school in New York  thinks about her for the next five years while he isn't doing contracts and briefs  runs into her again when he returns home after the death of his father on the eve of a big exam five years later  and gets involved with her romantically again. But director and co-writer Matthew Cole Weiss goes way over the top  framing the whole thing in flashback as Dave confesses to murdering Emily  her husband and another one of her lovers in front of (here comes the spoiler) a Lesbian cop who's also a flame of Emily's. Weiss overdoes the flanging effect by which Dave gets to see chunks of his previous life flash before his eyes even before he's actually dead  cutting those in even while Dave and Emily are having sex and thereby ruining the soft-core porn shots that give even some otherwise pretty lame Lifetime movies at least a bit of audience appeal. I couldn't help but flash back myself to James M. Cain and how much better he wrote women like this in his classic thrillers (all adapted into hit movies) The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double Indemnity and Mildred Pierce. It also doesn't help that the film ends with the bad guys (the bad girls  actually) triumphant and the decent  if naïve and stupid  hero seemingly on his way to the lethal injection table  or that the actors playing the people Dave and Emily are cheating on are both better looking than they are. Incidentally  though this film went straight to cable in the U.S. there were some blank spots on the soundtrack indicating where swear words were blipped  so I presume this got a theatrical release somewhere in the world.",negative
Saw this as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they got better movies than this  because this film failed to deliver on any of the hopes that audience may have entertained  from the fantasy of seeing James Franco without his shirt  down to more simple wishes  such as decent acting  coherent direction  character development  or actual production values. Plagued by film school effects such as freeze frames to show moments of emotional distress  and obvious influences ranging from My Own Private Idaho to Terminator 2  this film failed on almost every level to engage the audience. After the first twenty minutes of valiantly trying to take it seriously  the audience collectively threw up it's hands and just started to enjoy the inherent crappiness of the film. I could be upset that I paid nine bucks to see it  and it was two hours I'll never get back  but on the other hand  it was an entertaining two hours I'll never get back. This would have been a classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.,negative
A quick  funny coming-of-age matinée romp appealing to the underdog aldolescent in us all. It functions  in effect  as a vehicle for Justin Long who has subsequently erupted onto our screens in the fourth Die Hard via PC vs Mac ads  Dodgeball and The Break Up. He's funny  earnest and young - a big career ahead.<br /><br />A town's worth of college wannabes find a fake website Bartelby (Long) has set up to delude his judgemental parents and descend on the 'college' like it were a short notice Facebook party. Lewis Black summises the anarchic philosophy as a stand-in Dean - Long's delinquent friends provide support for the subterfuge and consequent appeal to grander traditions of education and friendship (Adam Herschman deserves special mention for his never-flagging slapstick contribution). Well executed  feelgood and instantly forgettable. 4/10,negative
I wasn't so impressed with this film  finding it quite tiresome and plain. The plot line was interesting  a kid creating his own college and enrolling hundreds of kids  but the laughs were few and far between. The jokes weren't really funny and i didn't bust a gut at any of the scenes. The characters weren't intriguing and I didn't feel for any of them  even the dawky  fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group. It was a good first watch  but it didn't blow me away and its not one that I would recommend. Comparing it to other films in the same genre  ie  American Pie is just cruel  because there is a film which was laugh-a-plenty. This ACCEPTED failed to raise a smile!,negative
Inane  awful farce basically about a young man who refuses to conform or better uses non-conformity to attain his objectives-fool his parents into thinking that he is attending a college. Truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied to. After viewing this junk  you will see why.<br /><br />What a ridiculous name- South Hampton Institute of Technology. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the initials of this school of nonsense. Problem with these type of films is that in the end  the non-conformist becomes the accepted mode.<br /><br />Let's step back to the world of reality and call this film what it really is- excessive manipulative junk!,negative
I see absolutely nothing funny---even remotely funny---in this stupid movie. An unrealistic  silly  ridiculous idea--just completely ridiculous. Hard to believe that the main character  who seems so articulate  intelligent and imaginative  would not be accepted to any college. Even more difficult to believe is that no one shut the place down. The actors portrayed characters straight out of Characterville. We have seen their lot many a time over in many films. Nothing new here. I found it on late night TV  and since there was really nothing else on  I watched the whole boring  stupid film. What a total waste. Maybe if you are a teenager  you may find it amusing. Films are made for an immature mind  so teens  go for it. The rest  no way.,negative
The most positive points in this film were the credits (text style) and some moments in Ice-T's acting. The story-line; two rival gangs having to fight it out  with the sub-plots of betrayal  power and change are well worn plots but in this case painful(very) to wade through. The decrepit scenery  which added slight believability in places  and questionable lighting  constantly distracted from any interest/identification with the characters (the shine off of the actress's forehead/nose was blinding  not to mention other scenes with the same problem.) Not even half way into the film I wanted to know more about how and why it came about as opposed to what was going on on screen. A disappointment if you have seen Ice-T in other roles. Kudos to other actors/actresses who seemed to get into their roles despite the weak direction; Corrupt's side kick and the other restaurant worker.,negative
"Let me start by saying that there's really no reason to watch this movie. I only sat through it because I was trying to kill some time before going to work.<br /><br />Basically  it's your typical sophomoric comedy aimed at the teenage set. There's nothing remarkable about it other than the complete ridiculousness of the story  not to mention that there are plot holes big enough to sail a Carnival cruise-liner through. Obviously this isn't supposed to be a realistic movie  it's supposed to be funny. Sadly  it mostly fails on that count as well. I must admit that I laughed a few times  but mainly in a holy sh*t, I can't believe how stupid this is kind of way.<br /><br />If you never see this movie you're not missing a thing.",negative
Seriously  I don't understand how Justin Long is becoming increasingly popular. He either has the best agent in Hollywood  or recently sold his soul to Satan. He is almost unbearable to watch on screen  he has little to no charisma  and terrible comedic timing. The only film that he has attempted to anchor that I've remotely enjoyed was Waiting... and that is almost solely because I've worked in a restaurant. But I digress. Aside from it's terrible lead  this film has loads of other debits. I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy  but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence  and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive. Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too  as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained  which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow. The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim). His one liners were funny on occasion  but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable. If you just want to completely turn your brain off (or better yet  don't have one) then maybe you'd enjoy this  but I can't recommend it at all.,negative
this movie was downright awful. most of the comedic scenes seem stale and trite  and possibly the funniest scene in the movie had already been given away in previews. the entire premise of the movie is so unbelievable and ridiculous its hard to really get into it. the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters. its not just the fact that the movies so hard to swallow  but its how they keep forcing it down your throat expecting you to dumb down and accept it. the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict. boy somehow gets rejected from every school he applied to(i suppose he completely forgot about attending community college) and decides to create his own school for fellow rejects. all goes well for awhile until the validity of his school comes into question. all the while the dorky character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into falling for him with his witty sarcasm  which apparently is a skill only he possesses. then comes the final struggle with the students somehow all bonding together and fighting for the survival of the school. of course the main character then persuades the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some inspirational speech. this movie would have been more fun to watch if i was under the age of 16 and still ignorant of all college matters and issues.,negative
"Synopsis: Kid is not accepted into any colleges. He creates a college where he and his friends can party by using their parent's tuition money. <br /><br />Wow. A Paean to ignorance. <br /><br />If you believe that we're all OK  man  then this movie is for you. Furthermore  you must understand that:<br /><br />1. Kids have it all inside them--they just need to let it out.<br /><br />2. Teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with. <br /><br />3. Someone else should pay for you to follow your passion. <br /><br />4. 300 teenagers can live together in harmony  as long as you take away those restrictive rules. <br /><br />5. Extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. <br /><br />6. If the Board of Education allows you to open a charter school with nontraditional teaching techniques, it's because they have your best interests at heart. (Not that they are willing to let go of low-functioning students who will end up working fast food anyways.) <br /><br />This movie is one in the college comedy genre  i.e. Animal House. It follows the pattern pretty closely. What's new here though  is a complete attack on higher education  not a parody of the bad elements. It's missing the sympathetic insider  a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life. <br /><br />This lack of balance will doom this film to the back rows of Blockbuster. It is so one sided  that I wondered if it was an ironic self-referential take on the whole genre--for about one minute. The movie has no deep meaning  no layers  no introspection. It's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally. And what is natural is what the name of the school is: S***. <br /><br />(Never thought I'd say this: Go see something with Will Farrell instead. His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)",negative
The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal fairs in My Giant is to say that this movie is to his career as Ishtar was to Warren Beaty's - it didn't ruin it  but it slowed it down.......a lot. Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play opposite a kid 2) never play opposite an animal 3) never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you  is as innocent as a kid and acts like an animal.<br /><br />What is this story? A comedy? I guess  but I didn't laugh  except at the scenes where Crystal is on his own and not burdened with his (what-is-her-role-in-this-movie) ex-wife or the afore-mentioned Giant. Did I mention there's also a kid in this film? Well  forget about him. The son is brought in to make us feel sorry for Crystal  and we do  but for the actor  not the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you don't believe me  watch him in old episodes of Soap or Saturday Night Live. Go rent City Slicker or Running Scared or When Harry Met Sally.<br /><br />Giant is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum.<br /><br />,negative
This is one of the most predictable movies I have ever seen. And this supposed to be funny..... Boring  boring  boring. Find the fast forward button at your remote and use it... I can`t say I laughed once  and the only good feeling this movie gave me was relief when it ended.,negative
I'm still laughing- Not! I'm still asking my myself what the point was. I barely got a chuckle  this movie sucks. It tries to be charming and touching  but it turns out stupid. I do not recommend it.,negative
David Bryce's comments nearby are exceptionally well written and informative as almost say everything I feel about DARLING LILI. This massive musical is so peculiar and over blown  over produced and must have caused ruptures at Paramount in 1970. It cost 22 million dollars! That is simply irresponsible. DARLING LILI must have been greenlit from a board meeting that said hey we got that Pink Panther guy and that Sound Of Music gal... lets get this too and handed over a blank cheque. The result is a hybrid of GIGI  ZEPPELIN  HALF A SIXPENCE  some MGM 40s song and dance numbers of a style (daisies and boaters!) so hopelessly old fashioned as to be like musical porridge  and MATA HARI dramatics. The production is colossal  lush  breathtaking to view  but the rest: the ridiculous romance  Julie looking befuddled  Hudson already dead  the mistimed comedy  and the astoundingly boring songs deaden this spectacular film into being irritating. LILI is like a twee 1940s mega musical with some vulgar bits to spice it up. STAR! released the year before sadly crashed and now is being finally appreciated for the excellent film is genuinely is... and Andrews looks sublime  mature  especially in the last half hour......but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY frilly and I believe really killed off the mega musical binge of the 60s..... and made Andrews look like Poppins again... which I believe was not Edwards intention. Paramount must have collectively fainted when they saw this: and with another $20 million festering in CATCH 22  and $12 million in ON A CLEAR DAY and $25 million in PAINT YOUR WAGON....they had a financial abyss of CLEOPATRA proportions with $77 million tied into 4 films with very uncertain futures. Maybe they should have asked seer Daisy Gamble from ON A CLEAR DAY ......LILI was very popular on immediate first release in Australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months but it failed once out in the subs and the sticks and only ever surfaced after that on one night stands with ON A CLEAR DAY as a Sunday night double. Thank god Paramount had their simple $1million (yes  ONE MILLION DOLLAR) film LOVE STORY and that $4 million dollar gangster pic THE GODFATHER also ready to recover all the $77 million in just the next two years....for just $5m.... incredible!,negative
I saw this movie a while ago and I was looking forward to it. My biggest problem was having seen the trailer I was expecting a very stylish marshal arts movie with plenty of action and maybe a bit of plot to think about along the way. I was sorely disappointed as it would seem that once you have seen the trailer there is nothing else worth watching (if what you are expecting is as described above). My girlfriend at the time gave up half way through and whilst I continued to watch in the hope that something interesting might happen... nothing did. I found no attachment or real interest in any of the characters. I would say just don't bother unless you have a few hours of your life that you don't really care about losing.,negative
Since this show was changed from TSS (the screen savers) to AOTS (attack of the show)it has gone down hill. TSS with Yoshi and Kevin Rose Alex... etc. Made the show awesome  then they got fired from TSS for an unknown reason. When the show switched to AOTS  it became less about computers  and more about gaming and magazines. It also promoted bands that nobody had heard of  or cared about. Finally I couldn't watch it anymore once Kevin Rose left. He kept it interesting  but he went off to do his own thing  which is good. Kevin Rose now has several online pod casts  and shows  etc on the REV 3 network. Check it out. REV3.com I think  you can get to it by going to www.systm.org. If you want a real tech show rather than aots  then go watch Kevin Roses shows or listen to the tWit podcast.<br /><br />J<,negative
This show is what happened to The Screen Savers after G4 got its hands on it  taking it from a useful source of computer-related information to a show that had as its high point the shoving of a miniature web server up someone's posterior.<br /><br />As G4's ratings plummeted  they moved away from their original target audience  gamers  to generic hormone-driven young men  adding eye candy to the staff and a sex advice segment. Now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust. I look forward to the show's  and the network's  overwhelmingly overdue and well-deserved demise.,negative
As a flagship show  Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic of the larger fall of G4 TV; it is a show (and a station) that has fallen so far that it parades sex to try and cover its glaring faults. Its predecessor  The Screen Savers  was a venue for troubleshooting technology problems and scouting out the latest and greatest in technology. It was a nice show with a likable staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments the crew could put to together.<br /><br />The acquisition of TechTV by G4 bothered some longtime fans of the station  but early returns were actually promising. The emphasis on gaming was a nice addition and I really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of E3 and other big entertainment events.<br /><br />Unfortunately  AOTS now stands as but a shell of its former self. Those overseeing the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and toward anything that might elicit drool from young adult men. The result is that AOTS spends as much time parading Olivia Munn or touting the adult film industry as it does covering games. It is so bad it is practically unwatchable.<br /><br />While some may get puerile joy out of this sort of thing  those who genuinely enjoy gaming may wonder where the good coverage went. Equally troubling  young gamers who might tune into G4 thinking their getting gaming - that active gaming group between 10-15 - are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience. On a channel like HBO or Cinemax  things like that are expected. On G4  it's tragic.<br /><br />At least SpikeTV  another male-aimed channel  has good programming like CSI. AOTS  and G4  has very little good left to offer.<br /><br />Too bad  really.,negative
I'm the type of guy who loves hood movies from New Jack City to Baby Boy to Killa Season  from the b grade to the Hollywood. but this movie was something different. i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable. but some bits were just weird. well the acting wasn't to good  compared to Silkk The Shockers performance in Hot Boyz (quite good) and Ice-T in new Jack and SVU (great). the scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills the wanna be Jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both Ice-T and the other dude  this kills the Jamaican  however Ice-T is unharmed  very similar to Ice's other movie Urban Menace (which stars both of these actors) were Snoops character is supernatural  however after this there is nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh-WITH OUT BLOOD. and when MJ confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend Benny was weird  Benny isn't introduced in this movie and the scene isn't in the film. it does hold weight to the fact why Corrupt wants to kill MJ but is still makes u scratch your head. wen Jody writes a letter to Miss Jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn't mention what happen 2 other main characters MJ and Lisa. the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto-which plagues the lives of Latinos and Blacks word wide-was a good part of the film  even though the clip of the projects was re-used thousands of times. and the scene where Miles kills the Latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running into my Latino brothers car would of killed him. the movie was similar to the film Urban Menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team. it was OK tho. but me being from poverty i love hood films  however if u don't love em like i do Don't WATCH IT. only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with 100 dollars  and my love of the genre.<br /><br />Nathaniel Purez,negative
This meandering tale of mob revenge is simply not very interesting  even with Ed McMahon in a ripe role as the chief heavy. Jim Brown kicks ass effectively  Gloria Hendry proves again that she can bring life to even the poorest roles  and Brock Peters is decent as The Cop Who Plays By the Book. It's still dull and badly constructed  and even the print shown on cable is now emasculated of its original James Brown score.,negative
I rented this movie primarily because it had Meg Ryan in it  and I was disappointed to see that her role is really a mere supporting one. Not only is she not on screen much  but nothing her character does is essential to the plot. Her character could be written out of the story without changing it much.,negative
D.O.A. is a non-thrilling thriller from directors Rocky Morton and Annabel<br /><br />Jankel. The acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad. This movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence<br /><br />are. For example  someone is shot near a window. We then see from outside<br /><br />the building what looks like that person jumped. I laughed my head off when this happened. This movie tries hard  but ultimately fails. Only watch this movie<br /><br />when you have no other choice.<br /><br />My Critique: **<br /><br />Rating: [R]<br /><br />Rating Reasons: Violence and language.*<br /><br />*There was no rating reason available due to its age.,negative
This review contains a partial spoiler.<br /><br />Shallow from the outset  'D.O.A.' at least starts as if it might be a slick  entertaining piece of nonsense like Fincher's 'The Game'. It's central character(Dennis Quaid) suffers from a nightmarish sequence of events that appear to be setting up a twisted and cunning thriller. But the plot rattles along at too great a pace  leading to a dramatic twist not half way through  when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days to live. And this  simply  is too big a twist to add casually to a story. Once this has happened  the film's only chance of success is if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its principal  indeed  its only subject matter: but 'D.O.A.' continues as if this was just a normal revelation like any other you might usually encounter in a thriller. The problem is two-fold: firstly  Quaid's actions don't convince as what someone is his situation would be likely to do; and secondly  even if they did convince  it's hard to care about what happens next when the most significant point of plot has already been prematurely resolved. The rest of the film is pretty standard fare for a film of this sort  but made more tedious than usual by the character's slightly-treated predicament  which logically dwarfs the events the film is interested in. Dennis Quaid  in the lead role  doesn't convince either as a burnt out professor or as a man who is destined to die: Meg Ryan is  as often  ditzy and annoying. Another negative feature is the ugly 80s soundtrack. Watch 'The Game' instead  which from similar roots remains tight and character-driven  whereas 'D.O.A.' drifts into developments that only undermine its own premise. As the premise is itself quite intriguing  it's a shame to see it drowned in a surplus of over-cooked plot.,negative
Interesting plot but painfully dull. The script lacks... lacks acting. To me this film compares with Made for TV type movies. I was lucky to survive the film without falling asleep in my popcorn. I watched this film with my family. It is fairly safe to watch with your kids. (only 1 semi sex scene)If you wish to see a young Meg Ryan...check out this movie. Very 80-ish. You will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people at Christmas  booze  super glue and tar. Or maybe you are like me... and have have a higher standard for acting in films. However I did like the way the movie began and ended! Mark.,negative
I'm a fan of the 1950's original and about 20 minutes into this remake I started to think this was going to be as good as the original but it wasn't. The motive for the murders was incredibly stupid. Two of the lovers in the movie turn out to be brother and sister-excuse me while I barf. The main character stops in the middle of the movie to have sex which doesn't make sense considering the situation he's in. If the film makers wanted a sex scene they should have put it earlier in the movie before the main character (Dexter played by Dennis Quaid found he's about to die and that he's accused of a crime. There is a reason for where the sex scene is at. Early in the movie Dexter isn't living life to the fullest so he's not interested in sleeping with Meg Ryan. I still feel it would make more sense for the sex scene to have either been cut or earlier in the film and the two siblings not to have been lovers.<br /><br />One of the dumbest parts of the movie involves a gun fight  a couple people getting killed and one person being run over all within 15 yards of a crowded carnival and yet NOBODY AT THE CARNIVAL NOTICES!!! Also in the scene is the tar pits the university where the movie takes place is built on. If you fall into the tar you sink to the bottom and in a matter of seconds. Not only is it hard to believe stuff would sink that fast in tar  but more importantly who builds a university on tar pits. I would say more about how stupid the end of the movie is but I don't want to put a spoiler in my post.,negative
Great story and great lead actors (Quaid and Ryan) but the movie suffers from bad directing bad screenplay and bad script.The lead actors do their part but could not save the movie at all.Too bad because this could have been a good 80's style Hitchcock suspense/mystery/thriller.Ryan looked so young and fresh in this one though.An ok look for big Ryan fans.....,negative
Seriously  I can't imagine how anyone could find a single flattering thing to say about this movie  much less find it in themselves to write the glowing compliments contained in this comment section. How many methamphetamines was Bogdonovitch on during the filming of this movie? Was he giving a bonus to the actor that spat his lines out with the most speed and least inflection or thought? The dialogue is bad  the plot atrocious  even for a screwball comedy  and claims that the movie is an homage to classic film comedy is about the most inane thing I've ever heard. The cinematography is below the quality and innovation of that exhibited by the worst made-for-TV movies  the acting is awful (although I get the feeling that the fault for that lies squarely in the lap of the director)  and speaking of which  did I mention the direction is so haphazard and inscrutable that it defies the definition of the word? The whole thing is a terribly unfunny (even in the much-beleaguered world of so-bad-it's-funny clunkers)  soul-sucking  waste of two hours of your life that you'll never get back. Be afraid  be very afraid...,negative
Rudolph Maté's film from 1950 is given a revamp for the 80's  Dexter Cornell(Dennis Quaid) is a university lecturer who used to have a successful writing career  but thats now gone down the tubes along with his marriage. The initial exposition plants the notion in the viewers mind that everybody has something against him  so when the revelation comes that he has been poisoned  we are not that surprised  unless of course you are familiar with the original. Dexter after being told he has less than 48hrs to live  decides to trace back his steps with the help of one of his students Sydney Fuller(Meg Ryan)  but they find they have many obstacles in their way.<br /><br />The film begins promisingly in black and white  as Dexter staggers in the rain towards the local police station where he wishes to report a murder...his own  but the Huey lewis style 80's beat that accompanies this scene only serves to remove any sense of tension and tells the viewer that this is going to be pretty bad  its only a question of how bad? Sure enough we are soon using the old flashback medium  but now the film resorts to full Technicolor. There are some brief homages to Noir  as the embracing couple stand in front of a venetian blind  but there's really nothing here to recommend it  the performances are awful  Ryan in particular doing her usual dizzy blonde with a cutesy pie smile routine. The film is a lazy attempt to put some unneeded ooomph into an already fine movie premise  obviously trying to cash in one the Body Heat audience  the seeming results are undoubtedly aimed at a teen audience and to be sure  they are welcome to it. 4/10,negative
DANGER: Watch for falling spoilers...<br /><br />Boy  was this a bad movie. I know that they were going for a true love conquers all kind of thing  but about all this film conquered was about 3(which felt more like 9) hours of my afternoon which I will never get back. The movie is about two young lovers named Kai and Gerta who live in a remote town in a fantasy world. Kai is the much-abused bellboy at a hotel owned by Gerta's father. At first Gerta ignores Kai's advances but she eventually warms up to him much to the disgust of (You Guessed It!) Gerta's father. As if this obstacle wasn't enough to overcome  an evil snow queen shoots a shard of glass in Kai's eye and he becomes a mean person treats Gerta poorly. Kai is eventually taken to the Snow Queen's fortress (Which is the same set as the hotel just covered in ice  because the good people at Hallmark like to go all out) and Gerta sets out on a mission to get Kai back. Along the way she runs into the 3 other seasons that are evil in their own special way  but Gerta escapes them with the help of some dull and forgettable characters she meets along the way. (All the while you will want to turn it off  but can't force yourself to do it. It's probably the most evil and most effective spells cast by the Snow Queen) Anyways  I will spare you from the ending because anything you can think up in your head right now is probably better then how they ended it. So  in conclusion  the Snow Queen is an incredibly boring movie  which takes the fan out of fantasy.,negative
The Snow Queen is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen  about a girl  Gerda  who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen. This adaption attempts to capture that story's sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design  but fails on a number of counts.<br /><br />Like so many Hallmark productions  the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavy-handed scripting and direction. The two actors playing Gerda and Kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable; Bridget Fonda as the Snow Queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role. There's a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering three-hour miniseries. At least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story  particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main characters.<br /><br />That said  The Snow Queen would be just about ideal for pre-teens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience. It's great eye-candy without being scary  and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime over-the-top level that spells out the storyline in very  very bold text. Just make sure you read them Andersen's story too.,negative
Sometimes Hallmark can get it right - like The 10th Kingdom - but many of their fantasy films plod  and this falls into the latter category. The version I saw may have been cut (a demon [?] shown in the trailer and publicity stills didn't appear)  but anything that made the movie shorter can only be a blessing.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE ORIGINAL FAIRY TALE:<br /><br />Anyway  the film updates the story to the early part of the 20th Century (?)  and makes Gerda and Kay (here called Kai - being a Lexx fan  I kept expecting him to say  `The Dead do not solve puzzles') 18 year olds. Hans Christian Andersen's basic story is followed: the boy gets a shard of ice in his eye  goes bad  is taken off by the Snow Queen to solve a puzzle in her palace and Gerda goes to find him  having various adventures on the way.<br /><br />As the two main characters are older than in the original  a lot of time is spent getting them together and `in love'. Unfortunately  I was never convinced that they were particularly in love  and certainly not enough in love to make sense of Gerda's quest. By the time the main plot kicks in  the movie's pace has slowed to a crawl. Alas  when Gerda begins her search for Kai  it only manages to pick up the pace to a leisurely stroll.<br /><br />There are a few odd additions to the story that seem to go nowhere. At the start of the film the Snow Queen kills Gerda's mother  but no explanation for this is given. A polar bear living in the Snow Queen's palace is more than he seems (though this is possibly because the producers realised that the bear's feelings towards the Snow Queen would be OK in a Fairy Tale  but not in a modern film). Again  this is never explained. Also  hints that the Snow Queen has an erotic desire for Kai are dropped  but never followed through. The script is also full of anachronisms that really jar you out of the `fairy tale' mood.<br /><br />The production looks good  though there is evidence of penny-pinching: the Snow Queen's palace is the hotel where Gerda and Kai lived covered in ice. The three main characters are played with varying degrees of success: Kai comes across as bland as does Gerda initially  but once she sets off to find Kai you warm to her. Bridget Fonda looks great as the Snow Queen  but seems to be in a different movie to everyone else.<br /><br />Ultimately  the film is unsatisfying. It looks good  but drags and lacks magic.,negative
This 3-hour made-for-TV miniseries came home with us from Blockbuster's this weekend. The production company clearly spent a lot of money on sets  costuming (Bridget Fonda  especially)  and special effects (including a great Jim Henson talking polar bear & reindeer). They should have spent a bit more money getting a coherent script. The story line was so loose that it really never came together. One can overlook Irish-accented Germans  but not herky-jerky storytelling. With senseless loose ends which included a special guest appearance by the Devil  this one is certainly not destined to be a Christmas Classic. A shame that they wasted good performances by the two female leads.,negative
For all intents and purposes  Showtime was the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Why? Because having Deniro in the cast adds immediate credibility and makes you want to watch the movie. I had also made the mistake of watching 48 Hours and Beverly Hills Cop recently before seeing Showtime and for some strange reason thought Eddie Murphy was still funny. Well he's not. In fact it almost seems like he has been neutered. As I watched this movie I was in amazement that Deniro decided this was a good enough script to lend his name too. No chemistry between him and Murphy whatsoever. Horrible writing  horrible jokes  a movie that you THINK is supposed to be good can't get much worse than this. Not too long after sitting through the wretch that was Showtime I happened to watch National Security starring Martin Lawrence. The movie had its funny parts but wasn't that great. But still it was 20 times better than Showtime. Please if your a Deniro fan DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!,negative
I don't understand jokes. I do believe this is my problem with modern cinema  or those films that are made with millions of dollars in hopes that it will become the next greatest sensation. Isn't it odd  people just don't laugh as much anymore  and I do believe one of the diseases to that problem is the film Showtime. There was absolutely nothing  from the beginning to the end of the credits  with all of the bantering between Murphy and De Niro  with Russo as eye candy  with even standard clichés which make the general population swoon with pre-programmed laughter  there was nothing in this film that made me laugh. There weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film. From the beginning  I didn't buy the match-up of De Niro and Murphy as anything more than Hollywood excitement  throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the shoot  where was it in the film? This falls to either two problems  the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film. Either way  they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the Hollywood nightmare Showtime.<br /><br />Outside of finding no reason to laugh  there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film. There was a glimpse of humor with De Niro's desire to pick up pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine so audiences would understand  WHO DOES THAT?)  but that was dropped and never developed. There was the idea that Murphy was an actor  but outside of that one opening monologue  nobody would have understood that. He rents a room in a producer's house in which he can afford on a police officer's salary? This just didn't compute even for Hollywood standards. There was a bad guy who wanted a big gun  but the gun was never developed  nor was there any true test of the weapons capability  even at the end. It became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns. Where was the television show in this? Russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning  but there were no consequences. There was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribble. Random characters were introduced  forgotten  re-introduced  and forgotten all over again. The director and producer laughed at this  while we  the meager viewer  must suffer through inside jokes and cliché stereotypes.<br /><br />Was there a love interest in this film? Was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen? Were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos throughout this film? If you need the answers to these  obviously  you won't find them in Showtime. The fact that I am riddling this review with question upon question  only means that this sub-par (actually  well below sub-sub-sub par) filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic world. Sure  it had big names and one really neat explosion  but there was nothing of substance to this at all. It was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichés  but not regular clichés  go with the bad ones. The plot had no linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were drab and underdeveloped. This ranks below even the best of buddy-cop films. I like to give films the benefit of the doubt  but nothing worked in this film. Not even Shatner could save this film  and he even tried hard.<br /><br />Overall  I cannot  nor will I  suggest this film to anyone with a pulse. The commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws  horrid jokes  and creators questioning the validity of their work. If creators can't stand behind Showtime  why should we? I didn't want a Lethal Weapon when I watched this  but I did want something like that. I understand there was some form of criticism of reality television and the corrupt nature of the media  but that message didn't make it off the page. In fact  I believe I saw media leave the theater first when I watched this. Shame carries its heavy hand with this film and I cannot blame it. Murphy used to be a big star  comedy was his middle name (see Coming to America)  but lately he seems to have lost his edge. De Niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him  but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further. One of these films is equal to one Scorsese picture.<br /><br />Skip this one. I promise  it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile. Oh  and if you laughed at any of the jokes in this film  I am truly sorry! <br /><br />Grade: * out of *****,negative
Bubbling just beneath the surface of Showtime is a good idea. Actually  it's more like two or three ideas that constantly fight for screentime. This film doesn't just have its cake and eat it too; it has the whole bakery.<br /><br />Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has a drug bust interrupted by the media and a brash  cop-slash-actor named Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot  he angrily shoots the camera out of the hands of a pestering newsman  and the tiff lands him in a new reality cop show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of many errors and oddities in the movie  that injured partner is never heard from again or alluded to for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />De Niro's best gag is his speech to a classroom of small children to open the picture about how TV cops don't act like real cops. Funny thing is  as the movie progresses  his character and Murphy's begin to act more and more like the clichés they supposedly clash so strongly with. In a smarter movie  De Niro's diatribe could have played as ironic comment; here  it only shows to point out how truly lame the movie is. While a spoof of a reality based cop show could be funny  the team of writers and director Tom Dey (Who made the far superior Shanghai Noon a few years ago; see that movie instead) seem to be on unsure footing  and instead of slamming the TV industry  they really let them off light (The harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is they like to play ping pong at work). Russo's character has a glint of fiendish delight in her eye  but her dialogue and actions rarely match the actress' enthusiasm. <br /><br />With little on screen to keep my attention  my mind began to wander  and that's dangerous in a movie with this many plot holes. For instance; if Showtime (the name given to the cop show) is such a popular smash  why doesn't anyone seem to recognize De Niro and Murphy when they are on the job? For that matter  if their investigation of smuggler and all around mean guy Vargas is being televised  why the heck hasn't someone mentioned to him that they are on his trail? Then again  given this villain's actions maybe I shouldn't be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry at an associate for using his new supergun without approval  jeopardizing a deal  and then dispatches him how? By using about ten of the superguns to level his entire house  of course! That's like putting out a fire with a bigger fire. <br /><br />Occasionally  Showtime gets laughs  but there simply aren't enough for the film's nearly two hour running time. Even worse  the really smart gags suggest that this movie really could have been on to something  if only they had put in a few more drafts of the script. Murphy mugs and talks as fast as he can with minimal results  and De Niro looks flat out bored through most of this. After a completely unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters (That remarkably results in no injuries and no arrests) Russo's character shouts `That's great television!' Perhaps it's great television  but it's far from a great movie.,negative
Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that results in a great comedy. Great expectationa often lead to dissapointment  and this proves to be the case.<br /><br />When Eddy as a police officer spoils a drug deal being done by Detective Robert  they botch it so badly that they end up doing a live action reality TV cop show. Logic is not a great component of this movie. The super-gun that they spend the second half of the movie chasing down confirms it. A twelve guage machine gun that leaves large holes in sheetmetal and three will destroy a house in about a minute (without reloading) is as more a fantasy than science fiction. A five pound gun  firing hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil  is certainly the weapon of the future using the technology of the past.<br /><br />It is clear this movie was designed for neither adults nor children  so if you are somewhere in between  this is the movie for you.,negative
"MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br /><br />How did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreaded<br /><br />drivel? Robert DeNiro plays a Dumb Hollywood version of the standard<br /><br />violence prone tough cop (i.e.  he beats up the bad guys and rolls his<br /><br />eyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book)  and Eddie Murphy plays a<br /><br />not so tough cop who would rather be an actor (i.e.  he screams out <br /><br />Freeze, police! and has his tough look down pat). Naturally  they<br /><br />are partnered when Bobby's loose cannon tactics get him in hot water<br /><br />with the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a<br /><br />Cops-like reality show. Take a breath  cuz that's as funny as it<br /><br />gets.<br /><br />No energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale retread of<br /><br />every copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with 15 Minutes starring <br /><br />yes  DeNiro himself as  pretty much the character he is playing here. <br /><br />The jokes fall flat  the action feels listless  and no one seems to be<br /><br />having a good time. It's dead on the screen.<br /><br />Please don't waste your time. Even if you have an overwheming affinity<br /><br />for one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor. Becauze if this<br /><br />makes money  these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptable<br /><br />for actors of their quality.<br /><br />And to Mr. DeNiro. You used to make serious films. I remember them -<br /><br />they were good. You were nominated for awards for them - remember how<br /><br />much fun that was? Now after Analyze This (which was good)  Meet the<br /><br />Parents (which was also good)  and The Adventures of Rocky and<br /><br />Bullwinkle (which was NOT good)  I think we need to see you parodying<br /><br />yourself less  and BEING yourself more. Casino feels like a long time<br /><br />ago. And no  I don't count 15 Minutes as serious Bobby. Anyone who<br /><br />took that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news",negative
Lowe returns to the nest after  yet another  failed relationship  to find he's been assigned to jury duty. It's in the plans to  somehow  get out of it  when he realizes the defendant is the girl he's had a serious crush on since the first grade.<br /><br />Through living in the past by telling other people about his feelings towards this girl (played by Camp)  Lowe remembers those feelings and does everything in his power to clear Camp of attempted murder  while staying away from the real bad guys at the same time  and succeeding in creating a successful film at the same time.<br /><br />I've heard that St Augustine is the oldest city in the US  and I also know it has some ties to Ponce de Leon  so the backdrop is a good place to start. Unfortunately  it's the only thing good about this movie. The local police are inept  the judge is an idiot  and the defense counsel does everything in her power to make herself look like Joanie Cunningham! I don't know whether to blame the director for poor direction  or for just letting the cast put in such a hapless effort.<br /><br />In short  this movie was so boring  I could not even sleep through it! 1 out of 10 stars!,negative
There comes a time in every big name actor's career when they get sloppy and accept projects that they wouldn't have touched with a 1000 ft. pole in their golden days. Remember Taxi Driver? That was a fine film. I can hardly believe that the De Niro of Showtime is the same actor.<br /><br />I would rather watch Time Chasers twice than see this film again. If anyone offers to take you to see Showtime or gives you free passes  or whatever  run away as fast and far as you can.,negative
The movie is not as funny as the director's preceding (and only other) movie  Shanghai Noon. Showtime did have its moments  but it did not satisfy me. Why it needed to be so foulmouthed  I don't know  but I give Showtime **/****,negative
With all the hype surrounding the stars of the movie  this movie left me wanting. I expected a much better movie considering the inclusion of the talents of Murphy  De Niro and Russo but found that the movie fell flat on it's face. Comedy sequences were overdone and the superior performances of the stars especially De Niro and Russo couldn't save this one!<br /><br />** out of *****,negative
Two popular actors are paired in showtime like De Niro and Murphy playing a police and an actor. Although they share the most screen time together  they do not reach their expected performances such films like Analyse This  Meet the Parents  Dr Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The film starts interestingly but becomes a thin  ordinary comedy which is quite disappointing.It feels like especially De Niro doesn't enjoy being in Showtime. Thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what I think. Unfortunately  if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie. Well  I don't think there would be a sequel to this at least casting De Niro and Murpy again. ** out of *****,negative
Watching Showtime I got the impression that the producers got the idea to put Robert DeNiro and Eddie Murphy just for the sake of having a film that co-starred the two of them. Other than that I can't think of a reason to justify the film's existence. Not that it isn't amusing in spots  it certainly is  but the concept is so completely ludicrous that the laughs are somewhat muted.<br /><br />The thing that really got me was Eddie Murphy's character. I can't seem to wrap my mind around the concept of someone being a police officer as strictly a day job. When I was working person at New York State Crime Victims Board I had to deal with all kinds of cops and they ran the gamut between the really dedicated and some real slugs  but I can't think of one who thought that this was just something I do until I get my career going in an area far afield. I mean  can you really see Eddie Murphy or anyone else going through the rigors of the real Police Academy  not the screen version  just to get a day job?<br /><br />Anyway DeNiro is your basic hard working detective who's on the trail of a major gun dealer. He's undercover and Murphy is part of his backup. So what does the showboating Murphy do  he calls a reality based TV series like COPS to film the action. <br /><br />So DeNiro's bust gets blown sky high  but the producer of the show gets some good footage of Murphy and DeNiro and decides on a new reality based television series. So these unwilling partners get joined and try to continue working DeNiro's case with all the TV cameras around.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy's a funny guy  I loved him in Beverly Hills Cop and in the Doctor Doolittle movies  but he's done better things than Showtime and Robert DeNiro certainly has. <br /><br />I guess Murphy wanted a chance to work with DeNiro and DeNiro must have gotten one hefty paycheck to do this film.,negative
I put down this vehicle from Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy  and Murphy in particular the first time but having seen it again  recently  I can see that it does have some very funny bits.<br /><br />This is by no means to say that this is the greatest buddy comedy of all time  but really what can you do to the already exhausted subgenre? What director  Tom Dey  has tried to do is make it a satire of the clichés of buddy comedy and the media. Early in the movie the executive of a cable network asks: How is this different from Cops?  when Chase Renzi is pitching the idea of a reality show dealing with De Niro's character  Mitch Preston (hilariously boring name by the way). That's when I saw it in a new light that I hadn't previously noticed.<br /><br />The idea is to show all the elements of the buddy comedy and put a twist on them. De Niro's reluctance to star in the show and to partner up with Murphy is right out of every cop film you can think of. You can say that De Niro is actually playing himself asking: Why would I do another movie playing a cop? Chase Renzi is portrayed to be a Hollywood phony but if you look at her opening scene again  she is merely doing it to save her job. She somehow sees the ridiculousness of what she is doing but she wants to succeed despite that. One line says it all: Who doesn't want to be on TV? Maybe this is reading too much into what is essentially a lightweight film  merely set to entertain  but it does give it a little spin that I hadn't noticed before.<br /><br />As for Murphy. You got to applaud him for looking this ridiculous. Trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell out everything he comes in contact with. Murphy was a big star and maybe it struck a nerve that it is all so fleeting.<br /><br />The plot with the gun is of course pretty boring. The action sequences are nothing special  except the end which required a lot of effort both from cast and crew. One thing that I noticed about the villain is that he is dressed like an 80's pop star. George Michael comes to mind and that adds to the whole media spin.<br /><br />So  I trashed it the first time around but what the heck; if you are gonna do this  why not point out how ridiculous it really is and De Niro and Murphy took a big chance doing this.,negative
I watched Deadly Voyage because David Suchet was in it  after enjoying him in the Poirot series. And Joss Ackland is always worth watching  so I went into the film with an expectation of it being a potentially worthwhile film. Alas  it was not to be.<br /><br />I won't bother critiquing the performances  the pacing  the cinematography or any other structural aspect of the film; others here have already given their opinions on those elements. The only thing I want to address is the film's message  since it proclaims in the intro that it's based upon a true story  and therein hangs the film's supposed importance.<br /><br />Deadly Voyage primarily focuses upon an impoverished black African man named Kingsley who wants to move to the US  because he believes that he can make money there. Nothing more  nothing less -- his motivation is utterly selfish. (Of course some people will prevaricate by saying that he was doing it for his family  but in fact he decided to have children on the income he could make in Ghana  so he really just created his own problem.) To that end  Kingsley decides to stow-away aboard a Russian freighter bound for New York. In the process of doing this  he faces harsh conditions  racist crew members and other challenges.<br /><br />But this is precisely where the film leaves me unsympathetic. Why should the audience be expected to care about Kingsley? Simply because he has a goal? Goals aren't such a rare commodity that his should be privileged above say  the goal of the ship's captain or the woman he left at home with his newborn child. Kingsley's goal is illegal in the eyes of the US Government. It is also illegal in that it steals from the Russian shipping company. If he makes it to the US  it would involve taking out of a system that he has not put into. And if he gets caught  the shipping company will be fined $45 000. I doubt very much that any of the stowaways care about what their chosen course of action is costing anyone else; they're clearly just out for their own gain. He could've spent the $1 000 he won in the lottery at the beginning of the film  for legal passage to the US  and applied for residency and a work permit. Instead  he takes the illegal (and dangerous) route.<br /><br />So since Kingsley's voyage is illegal  selfish and cannot be ethically justified  why should we care about him or his ordeal? Simply because he faces challenges? Why should his challenges be privileged above the challenge of the Russian shipping company getting to New York without stowaways? Because he's black and the shipping company is white? The reason seems to be because Danny Glover (the film's executive producer) and others involved want us to root for Kingsley  as if he's a hero on some sort of noble voyage. But once you accept that illegal immigration  theft and a fool's mission aren't noble at all  you can't really care about him.<br /><br />Before anyone plays the race card  I assure you that I would've felt the same no matter what ethnicity/nationality the involved parties were. Imagine if a British person decided to stow-away in a train headed for Bhutan  sneak across the border  and collect unwanted Buddhist antiquities  to bring back to Britain to sell. How much sympathy could the challenges he faced generate? Very little  I'd bet. So why should we feel different for Kingley? Because he's black? Because he's poor by American standards? The filmmakers are banking on us sharing their views that the ends justify the means  and that a shipping company being fined $45 000 is inconsequential compared to the remote possibility of an unskilled laborer earning slightly more in the US than he could've if he had just stayed in his own home country. I didn't buy it for a minute.,negative
I can imagine what happened for this film to come into being: a bunch of studio guys are sitting around  drinking gin-and-tonic  maybe a joint  and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a film that would bridge the generation gap  which at that time was about as far apart as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that both college-age rebels and their parents would find equally interesting-- for different reasons  perhaps  but still  a ticket is a ticket. What interested hippies? Asia  philosophy  pacifism  and wild sets and costumes. What interested their parents? Musicals  eye candy  a feel-good script  and nostalgia. Very well  then  Lost Horizon  the old classic  as a musical  in color. Can't miss  right? It was a bomb. Lost Horizon  by James Hilton  is perhaps less than a classic  but not a bad novel. In broad terms  he sketches out a utopian society in Shangri-la  The Valley of the Blue Moon  near Tibet  inhabited by peacefully contented villagers who serve an abbey of <i>very</i> long-lived monks. Intruding into paradise is a Gilligan's Island-like planeful of outsiders (a veteran of WWI  a missionary  etc.) each with their own spin on the situation -- what plot there is concerns the reaction of each of them to being presented with a choice to live in paradise  or try to return to the tumult of the Twentieth Century. Taken on its own terms  it's gentle  pop-lit fluff  presenting Hilton's own conservative British views in Oriental dress  as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie. As captive honored guests of the monks  the castaways are forbidden to leave the valley  but never pressed into work or prayer (not that the monks do too much of that themselves)  treated royally  and given simple  yet luxurious accomodations --who'd want to escape? In this Middle American Heaven-on-Earth  the monks are both cultured and wise  the climate is warm  the food is plentiful and tasty  the villagers are picturesque nonentities and nothing ever changes. The nuns are chaste  but encouraged to look pretty  and even flirt a bit ( the reason given is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of Tantric Sex I've ever read). Even their religion is nonthreatening: revealed as a best-of-both worlds blend of Christianity and Buddhism  there's little to offend any but the staunchest fundamentalist or the oddballs out there who actually knew something about Tibet (which in the early Thirties was a very small number).<br /><br />As a Capra film focussing on the adventure/character interplay angles it was enchanting; and perhaps Steven Spielburg could have made it fly  if he'd been around. As an early-Seventies Hollywood product  the adventure was over too quickly  and the updated roster of characters too bland  to make much of an impression. Deprived of the sketchy  suggestive qualities of classic B&W  the monastery resembles a de luxe beauty spa in white and pale blue  and while at least some of the monks' robes tried for historical accuracy  most of the rest of the inmates looked as if on their way to a morning massage and fango bath  with a couple of holes of golf in the afternoon. Maybe Stephan Sondheim could have restored some grit to the story  playing up the very real conflict inside each character's reaction; just five years afterwards  Brian Eno would have captured the tranquil atmosphere to a T; instead  Bert Bacherach and Hal David were given the job of writing the songs  which marry Muzak-like melodies with some of the clunkiest New Agey lyrics ever penned. Quite naturally for the time  every song calls for a dance number  which range from the merely forgettable to the completely boring  and so is the script  which has not one line worth quoting.<br /><br />Tie-ins with this movie were legion -- there were everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this film  and such was the hype that I actually went out and bought the sountrack album. Just about the only thing good I can say about it is that it made enough of an impression on me to write this review completely from memory nearly thirty years after -- the next month I read Aldous Huxley  bought a copy of the Bardo Thadol  and hence learned about real Tibetan culture. Moan.<br /><br />,negative
..but unfortunately no one thought about having Van killed in order to save this doomed production. The only positive thing about him in the film is his nice singing voice...too bad the songs are mostly insipid and sappy. Why did I hate Van so much? Well  throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a third-rate Soupy Sales imitation--with lots of mugging  bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh. The worst of these moments was when he was teaching the class--these kids laughed at EVERYTHING he did. Heck  Van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed! Now Van was not the only bad casting decision in the film--he was just the most obvious. Of course  having John Gielgud (a lovely actor) play an Asian was ridiculous as well as having Michael York play Peter Finch's brother!! The bottom line is that because of these insane casting choices  the film was doomed from the start....and the worst of them was the god-awful Bobby Van. Now in real life  he might have been a lovely person and it's sad that in real life he died so young  but with the material they gave him here I just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quiet.<br /><br />Now I also mentioned the songs--egad  those terrible songs!! The original LOST HORIZON by Frank Capra was a subtle delight throughout--and not a single song and dance number in the film. So why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that did nothing to help the film? They only served to make it seem like a gooey mess--like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a sickly sweet children's movie--not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8.<br /><br />Now if you can remove these problems  you have the basis of a decent film. After all  the plot is lovely and is still hidden beneath all the goo. Peter Finch is particularly good (though certainly not the equal of Ronald Colman in the original). But  considering that the original was a near-perfect classic  why bother with this sticky confection. Who wants to wade through the treacle?! <br /><br />By the way  this film was included in The 50 Worst Films book by Harry Medved. While I  too  disliked the film  it wasn't bad enough to merit inclusion in the book. I think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book--just not one of the best selections to the hallowed hall of dreck.,negative
"I was an extra on this film  in the part shot at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so; I was one of the fleeing (mostly Mexican) Bangladeshi refugees running across the runways at Ryan Field in Tucson. At one point  standing around in our turbans as we waited for another shot  one of my fellow extras turned to me asked me what the move was going to be about. I told him it was going to be a remake of Lost Horizons  only as a musical. There was a long pause  then he replied: Man, this movie is gonna suck. Pretty perceptive of him  I thought. I had a good time and made a bit of money  but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie I can't sit through the whole thing. <br /><br />If you ever saw the movie The Swarm  you can pretty much get the idea. You get to see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an an idea that on the face of it is just BAD. The idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money at a movie and hire enough big names  then a good story and good writing aren't necessary. Just turn the big crank  and out comes the product. It's just not worth watching.",negative
<br /><br />Never ever take a film just for its good looking title.<br /><br />Although it all starts well  the film suffers the same imperfections you see in B-films. Its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film  so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it thinking this way he is ingenious.<br /><br />A film to be listed on top of the garbage list.<br /><br />,negative
To remake Lost Horizon  as a musical  the need for a Rodgers & Hammerstein or Lerner & Lowe type musical composition was needed. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. Having said that  my favorite thing about Lost Horizon  is its score. It's just that the score doesn't fit the piece. The cast  is made-up of mostly non-musical talents (Ullman  Finch and Hussey  were all dubbed  and still don't sound all that great).<br /><br />Frankly  the novella  on which this  and the earlier non-musical film versions were based  is mediocre  at best. While the possibilities for a truly good  cinematic musical version exist  they are not realized here. The film succeeds at being a good  rainy-day vehicle  to pass the time. Otherwise  you are better off  buying the CD of its soundtrack. Only recommended as a curiosity piece  due to the film's awful reputation. I've seen much better; but I've seen MUCH worse.,negative
This movie would have been alright  indeed probably excellent  if the directors would have left the interviews and the concert footage separate. Into the Void is a great song  and I hate how it is cut off at the best part to go to an mumbling interview with Ozzy Osbourne. That should have been at the end of the film  or located in a special feature. The best part of concert DVDs is to put them on and let the music play  but Black Sabbath: The Last Supper is hard to put and and simply let play because the music is continually interrupted. Nevertheless  there are a few strengths to this film; the concert footage  when it does play  it excellent. Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long hiatus without Osbourne and this film captures that well: Sabbath basically rocks the fans. The fans  of course  have a sweet advantage in the film because they are seeing the band live  of course  but also they do not have to put up with the incessant interviews that the DVD viewers are burdened with. Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) for doing this to the film! Also  shame on Wyatt Smith for editing the film in such a way.,negative
"I always think it would be nice if you could somehow have a 'sneak preview' at some of the old movies that are re-released on DVD  before you purchase them. That way you could save yourself some time  money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let down.<br /><br />The Buddy Holly Story is such a movie.<br /><br />I do not wish to go into the characterizations  or the holes in the plot  or the messing around with historical facts that this movie encompasses  for I had already come to terms with them twenty years ago  when I first began watching it.<br /><br />I had recorded it on the old (Monaural) Beta machine back in the early 1980s  and liked it so much  that it became a regularly-played favourite. The best part  to my mind  was Gary Busey's performance as the young Buddy  and his near-perfect vocals and guitar playing.<br /><br />I looked forward to the day when I could have it in ...STEREO...  and that is where the disappointment comes in.<br /><br />This DVD version is (supposedly) re-mastered in both audio and video  according to the shell information  but I'm afraid it left me sadly let-down and glancing at my watch  wishing for it to end.<br /><br />The sound is murky  bordering on the unintelligible  and so unprofessionally mixed that it had me yearning for the crystal-clarity vocals of my old Beta tape! <br /><br />Despite what you think of the images  or the plot  or the characters  the real draw card here is the MUSIC......and if you can't hear the lead vocals because they are drowned out by the cymbals  or the backing harmonies  or other ambients  then there's not much left  is there? <br /><br />I'm going to convert my old Beta version to (Mono) DVD for subsequent viewings  and put this one where it belongs  out with the rubbish! <br /><br />Extinction is the Rule, Survival is the Exception...",negative
The most generic  surface-level biography you could hope for. Busey's impersonation of Holly is accurate -- but who wants to hear Gary Busey sing Maybe Baby? Typically  the members of the Hollies are used for comic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud  respectively) instead of as people or even characters. When Holly uses a string section  the old jewish-looking guys who come in tell him he's using the same techniques as Mozart. It's just this kind of cheeky statement that makes film biographies like this (and Amadeus  about the aforementioned Mozart) so worthless. Some entertainment can be derived from Holly's excellent styles and songs done in a B-variation.,negative
The best part in this movie is the first one  located in Sicily  I suppose. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising. The rest of the story is quite boring. Crialese uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters  trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and video-music technique  Fellinian surrealistic remembrances and a very annoying and completely off-topic soundtrack  leading the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly short. Frankly  this is a real overrated movie and Crialese is a real overrated director.,negative
***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW*** <br /><br />What a long and mostly uninteresting movie! Who were these characters? Why didn't I care about them? If I'm going to watch a movie for two hours  I'd like to care about somebody or something. <br /><br />We know that Salvatore dreamed of the riches to be found in the new world. Beyond that  though  we learned little about most of his family's hopes  fears  etc.  as they embarked on an adventure into the unknown.<br /><br />And why was Lucy even in this movie? She said little; we knew little about her or what she was doing (was she forced to service men in exchange for being allowed to board the ship?) or what her plans were upon reaching New York. To those who might suggest that she was needed to underscore the point that a single woman  however cultured  could not get into this country alone  I say that that fact is not enough justification to give her so much screen time. That point could have been made in five minutes  with Lucy as a momentary character.<br /><br />More questions: Why wasn't the twin brother at the boat to meet the family? We heard about the brother  and some closure on that point would have been helpful in giving the movie some cohesiveness. Also  how long was the journey from Italy to New York? Given the conditions on the ship  it makes a difference to the viewer if the voyage took five or 10 or 50 days. (Someone said something about seeing land a week at one point  but I think that was when they were already en route.) I needed these types of details to better appreciate what they were going through.<br /><br />The only scene I really liked was when the boat  filled with passengers  left the dock. <br /><br />If you choose to rent this movie  do so with remote in hand; you may want the Fast Forward button handy.<br /><br />Finally  may I suggest that  with the right voice-over providing helpful information about the times and the circumstances for immigrants--particularly during the slow stretches of endless shots of the countryside  people walking  etc.--this movie might have made an interesting public TV documentary.,negative
Being a history buff  I rented this movie because of the subject matter. The idea of the Ellis Island experience at the turn of the century focusing on one small group is intriguing. Unfortunately  the movie falls flat. Much of the story is simply boring; nothing much happens for long stretches. The director uses goofy imagery (offered up in the form of daydream sequences) in an apparent attempt to break up the glacial pacing  but instead  it clashes with the authentic look and feel of the movie. The characters are also poorly drawn. In the end  we don't really care as much about them as we should. It's a shame that this wasn't what it could have been. I would still like to see a good movie about the American immigrant experience  but this one isn't it.,negative
Talk about being boring!<br /><br />I got this expecting a fascinating insight into the life of the man who wrote the mythical Night on the Galactic Railroad. I expected to see crazy stories and hijinks of an eccentric man and to discover his inspirations for such bizarre material. Boy  was I wrong.<br /><br />Spring and Chaos is mostly boring with only sporadic moments of innovative animation. It's certainly nothing to write home about and nowhere near as good as NOTGR which is something that I suggest you watch instead. Leave this bore alone. If you absolutely MUST see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap. Do not pay top dollar.,negative
This is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen  it was horribly done it didn't flow it was very choppy  because of that many people didn't understand the movie at all. I had to watch this movie several times before I got an idea about what was happening  OK its like this a kid stole someones car and while running from the police he totals it  for some reason the cops let him off and he has to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle out in the wilderness  there he meets a girl who loves to rock climb and he gets into the sport and has to beg his uncle to let him enter a contest for climbing  and yeah thats about it like i said horrible movie.,negative
"As their entire career was a pale impersonation of The Beatles  it is no surprise that  shortly after the great fiasco of the Beatles Magical Mystery Tour, the Monkees would follow up with their own insipid and creative morass of a movie  called Head. Both movies are not so much a true story with a plot (though MMT attempted to define a plot) as they are a hodge-podge of skits and snippets  interspersed with music and songs and out-takes.<br /><br />Head has no plot  other than the pre-fab-four trying to break free of the box they are in (i.e. the type-casting of being Monkees and the surrounding commercialism) and yet  always finding themselves back in the box. Most skits involve breaks in the fourth wall and crossing over into other  seemingly unrelated scenes. Filled with anti-Vietnam war messages and attempts by the group to show their other talents  the film bounces around haphazardly- also to be blamed on the multiple directors.<br /><br />The film  like Magical Mystery Tour  is now excused by some fans as wonderful symbolism and misunderstood artistic statements. Phooey. Like MMT  it is too many guys with access to too many drugs all trying to make something artsy and making crap.<br /><br />Like MMT  Head has some clever moments and offers some relatively unknown Monkees songs that are quite decent. It does develop a bit more charm than MMT and is a bit easier to sit through  but it is not ironic at all that  like everything else the Monkees did  this was just a mimicry of something the Beatles did first... even when it comes to laying an egg.",negative
at a Saturday matinee in my home town. I went with an older friend (he was about 12) and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be OK (it's rated G). I was assaulted by loud music  STRANGE images  no plot and a stubborn refusal to make ANY sense. We left halfway through because we were bored  frustrated and our ears hurt. <br /><br />I saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre. My opinion had changed--it's even WORSE! Basically everything I hated about it was still there and the film was VERY 60s...and has dated badly. I got all the little in-jokes...too bad they weren't funny. The constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and there's absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on. Some people will love this. I found it frustrating...by the end of the film I felt like throwing something heavy at the screen.<br /><br />Also  all the Monkees songs in this movie SUCK (and I DO like them).<br /><br />For ex-hippies only...or if you're stoned. I give this a 1.,negative
The Monkees Head is one of those peculiar phenomenons I've noticed- that when something doesn't make sense  people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings  which its creator never intended. Such is the case here.<br /><br />The movie is a stream-of-consciousness spectacle of The Monkees floating in and out of various sketches  blackouts  set pieces  etc. similar to the ones on their TV show. But while the TV show was played for laughs  this doesn't seem to be played for anything except a sort of deep  trippy  pseudo-intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes. All in all  it's The Monkees doing the same schtick  but now it's consciousness-raising because the laugh track is removed. There is not a stitch of humor or meaning to the whole thing; it just drones on with colored lights.<br /><br />The music in Head should prove to anyone  beyond the shadow of a doubt  that the Monkees had not a scrap of songwriting ability. The tunes are mostly garbage; the only one that's even listenable is Porpoise Song  which opens and closes the film. But the thing is  that was a Gerry Goffin-Carole King song  and  while it's above-average for the Monkees  it's below-average by Goffin and King standards. It's like hearing one of the old Peter And Gordon songs that Paul McCartney wrote for them: you might think it's a pretty good song  but then you find out who composed it  and you realize it's a throwaway. Mike Nesmith's song is maybe passable  the rest is worthless. Davy Jones has  I guess  what the filmmakers imagined to be the big number in the picture  since it's the only song presented As Show Biz and not cut into a film montage or dream sequence  but it falls flat  too  just because the song isn't any good.<br /><br />I have to admit I always liked the Monkees  so the movie is a real disappointment. Sure  they were cheesy  but they were so cheerful about it.<br /><br />They knew they were cheesy and they were cool with it. But then they got ambitious. In Head  they actually joke about being a manufactured pop product  but the truth is  they wanted something more. They wanted to be Great Musicians and taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles  but something approaching that. Head proves that they failed on all counts. 1* out of 4,negative
Four things intrigued me as to this film - firstly  it stars Carly Pope (of Popular fame)  who is always a pleasure to watch. Secdonly  it features brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Thirdly  it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourthly  a friend recommended it to me. However  I was utterly disappointed. The whole storyline is absurd and complicated  with very little resolution. Pope's acting is fine  but Owen is unfortunately under-used. The other actors and actresses are all okay  but I am unfamiliar with them all. Aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie (and Pope and Owen)  this film isn't very good. So the moral of the story is...don't watch it unless you really want to.,negative
This is a poor excuse for a movie. A film noir done by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First  let's forget about the plot  a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh. So what turns her from despising him to loving him? Along with a group of other guys  he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off  stranding them. It isn't exactly heroics  but she's suddenly smitten. It's truly painful to watch Claude Rains trying to portray a hard-bitten  tough-talking  noir-type cop. A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool  along with a growling voice. Most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. How he ever got talked into taking this job I'll never understand. Enjoy it  if you can  for a few period details  the old cars and gas pumps  but don't expect a decent film experience. It wasted 1-1/12 hours of my life.,negative
I think Downey was perhaps inspired by French new-wave.<br /><br />Who wasn't?<br /><br />Unfortunately  what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new-wave.<br /><br />A synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and Downey appears to have lost plenty. <br /><br />Just say no  indeed. In more ways than one. Including to watching this film.<br /><br />I couldn't bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it. It would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether.,negative
Black and white satire of a Madison Avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks. They're headed by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who is determined to change things. However he turns out to be even WORSE than his white predecessors. That's about as original as this gets.<br /><br />I'm sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today. The jokes are either unfunny (the president is a midget. HOW is this funny?)  cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters. It's done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to take...or understand. The movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along. The ending comes out of nowhere. To make it worse  with the sole exception of Johnson  ALL the acting is bad. Antonio Fargas (a regular in these types of films) is especially annoying as the Arab. This gets three stars because the commercial parodies (done in bright color) ARE amusing and there's a rare good line here and there. I heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good. Skip it...unless you're in experimental 1960s films.,negative
Writer & director Robert Downey  Sr.  a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s  satirized the New York Madison Avenue advertising world with his avant-garde comedy Putney Swope. Downey doesn't confine his ridicule to advertising  but tackles black militant culture  the dynamics in Hollywood's portrayal of race  the elite white power structure  and character of corruption in any power struggle. As audacious and ambitious as Putney Swope strives to be  it qualifies as a terrible film  amateurishly made on a shoe-string budget with a no-name cast and humor that lacks hilarity. Everything about this movie reeks with improvisation. Putney Swope stirred up controversy during its initial release with its politically incorrect handling of race issues and consumer culture. Like most Marx Brothers movies  the plot is thin  providing an excuse for Downey's anecdotal gags  most of which are terrible.<br /><br />The chairman of a prestigious Madison Avenue ad agency dies during a board meeting. Before the body has been removed  the board holds a secret ballot vote to determine who will replace him. Each member understands that they are forbidden to vote for himself. Sheer accident occurs when everyone votes for the token black member  Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson)  since none thought anybody would cast a ballot for him. Swope pink slips all but one of the white executives  surrounds himself with black  pistol packing employees  and renames the firm Truth and Soul Advertising. Swope decides to alter the face of American advertising. He refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol  tobacco  or war toys. Swope's clients stage an exodus after he becomes the CEO  and grandstanding attracts a new line-up of clients that show up at his office lugging bags of money and prepared to suffer abuse from Swope's militant employees. Swope exploits his African-American staff  too  ruthlessly appropriating their ideas after he fires them and conjures up a number of offensive advertising campaigns  all of which are hailed as a 'new wave' of marketing genius. Incredibly  Swope's conservatism proves successful but the agency becomes the target of government operatives who argue Swope's advertising tactics constitute a threat to the national security. The high point of this black & white  85-minute comedy are the television commercials shot in color. Unfortunately  Downey doesn't know when to cut off these ads that consistently start out cleverly but wear out their welcome. The funniest part of Putney Swope involves our eponymous protagonist's dealings with U.S. President Mimeo in Washington D.C. (Pepi Hermine)  a marihuana-toking midget with a Kissinger-like Teutonic adviser (Larry Wolf) spouting tasteless jokes while trying to convince Swope to come up with an advertising campaign for his new car  the Borman 6.,negative
Starting with a tearjerking poem and images of american missiles  starving children and mutilated palestinians I quickly realised that this was not going to be a objective documentary. 5 youths convicted after the gothenburg riots are interviewed and give a very confused explaination why they had to trash the citycenter and then (oh my god) actually have pay for what they have done. I kept watching and many questions are raised  were the trial properly done and did the cops have the right to do what they did? Lots of questions asked... and then dropped. No interviews with judges or going through documents about the trial.. nothing.<br /><br />In short: Nothing new from what every Swede has seen on tv a hundred times - just poor propaganda.,negative
The basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage-a-trois. Fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this  using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists  invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience.<br /><br />It's really rather messy though. Fellowes doesn't seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat-edged. Rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves.<br /><br />The dialogue is inconsistent  stagey here  vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional cliché-landmine. Though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can't create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces. There's also a very prosaic  dare I say it British feel to the filming. I didn't want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation  I wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story.<br /><br />Finally it is  in fact  the story which lets the rest down. Just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes  woven as a vehicle for character examination. Wilkinson and Watson support this meta-essay with good performances and John Warnaby's ebullient colleague Simon to Wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow-furrowing.<br /><br />I'm disappointed; not that it's bad  but that it could have been much better. 3/10,negative
I went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine. I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of Ashton Kutcher he was only able to do comedy. I was wrong. Kutcher played the character of Jake Fischer very well  and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with such professionalism. The sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions. This one did exactly that. The entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie  and were moved to tears during the second half. While exiting the theater I not only saw many women in tears  but many full grown men as well  trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying. This movie was great  and I suggest that you go see it before you judge.,positive
The finest short I've ever seen. Some commentators suggest it might have been lengthened  due to the density of insight it offers. There's irony in that comment and little merit. The acting is all up to Noonan and he carries his thankless character perfectly. I might have preferred that the narrator be less recognizable  but the gravitas lent is pitch perfect. This is a short for people who read  for those whose bar is set high and for those who recognize that living in a culture that celebrates stupidity and banality can forge contrary and bitter defenders of beauty. A beautiful short film. FWIW: I was pleased at the Picasso reference  since I once believed that Picasso was just another art whore with little talent; like  I assume  most people - until the day I saw some drawings he made when he was 12. Picasso was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime. I understood immediately why he had to make the art he became known for.,positive
This is a very  very odd film...one that is so odd it's best you just see it for yourself. The film begins with a jaded professor haranguing his class because the students have the audacity to not be as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can tell very quickly that this man is a total cynic--finding the value in practically nothing but sticking to his own inner sense of self-importance. Additionally  he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life.<br /><br />Later in the film  he walks into a bank robbery and manages to annoy the robbers so much that one of them shoots him in the head. Oddly  this is only half-way through the film and what followed was a very bizarre narration of the final seconds of his life. This is when the film becomes exciting because the style of the narration is just like one of this literature professor's novels--one that is intelligently written and says things the way we wish we could all say them.<br /><br />See this weird film--it's amazingly compelling and not like anything I've ever seen before.,positive
Although Bullet In The Brain is  without question  superior amongst short films  it largely seems more like a short piece of writing than a film. And it is a little hard to feel too sorry for the teacher when his smart ass remarks get him shot. But after the bullet enters his brain we begin to understand a little bit about why he became so jaded with life in the first place. There is an awful amount of detail packed into this reasonably short film and this is what makes me feel that it should have been extended a little bit - it seems like there's almost too much to take in at once as the details come flying at you so fast. A slightly more relaxed pace and a less po-faced narrator in the final section would have benefitted this film a little bit. Despite these complaints  there is no denying that Bullet In The Brain is a quite stupendous work compared to many short  and even full length films. The makers should be applauded for trying to make such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and Hollywood action.,positive
...means take up and read  which is precisely what I felt like doing after having seen this marvelous film.<br /><br />Von Ancken stimulates and inspires with this breathtaking and superbly executed adaptation of Tobias Wolff's 1995 New Yorker article of the same name. The incredible performance by Tom Noonan is brilliant and provocative and the editing  sound design  cinematography and directing are truly inspired. The nuanced changes and embellishments on the original story are subtle  clever  and make the film cinematically more dynamic. It's lyrical pacing is mesmerizing and begs you to watch it again.<br /><br />Watch out for this young director...he's going places.,positive
<br /><br />Her Excellency Madam Shabana Azmi has worked in countless movies over life time. I think best is yet to come.<br /><br />Fire is ok.<br /><br />But still good days are yet to come.<br /><br />Hopefully  in Water I will be able see her better.<br /><br />Thanks and Regards.<br /><br />PS: India doesn't have a director to make best use of her.,positive
For a moment  let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie  even if it is a very important side of it  and let's look at the simple fact that this is a very nice love story. Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation  caused by two selfish husbands. They have to live through their sad days without any ray of hope. If each one of these two women had been alone  imagine what kind of life each one would have had to accept. They found each other and they fell in love. That this love was against all the social  religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant. They loved each other  found relief in each other  that was sufficient. The reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they have to accept  suffer even  and then they can go on with their lives  their life. Very nice.,positive
As well as being a portrayal of a lesbian love story  FIRE is also a comic satire of middle-class (?) Indian culture. I find this is a quality which is little appreciated about the movie. These two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do  but Mehta (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection. The servant Jatin's behaviour  the family's treatment of him  the bedridden grandmother's constant inescapable presence  Ashok's obsession with a swami's teachings: coming from a culture much like India's  these are things I can immediately identify as being typical. They have been crying out to be pointed out and ridiculed. While developing her primary subject matter  Mehta manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully. In fact  much of the humour in the film which provides essential relief from the heavy subjects of taboo lesbian love and gender issues  stem from this satire of the seemingly ordinary. The film flows from the comic to the serious with great subtelty.<br /><br />All in all  brilliant use of symbolic devices (Radha compared to Sita of legend and coming out of Fire unscathed and  therefore pure; the lifelong desire of the young Radha to see the ocean finally achieved when she gains freedom). Kudos to Shabana Azmi(Radha)  the lighting crew and Deepa Mehta; their very un-Hollywood-like (and un-Bollywood-like!) talents made this movie special. One criticism: the first scenes seemed rather disjointed to me in that they did not flow into each other very well.<br /><br />The verdict: 9 on 10. Nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned on my mind.,positive
Easily one of the best Indian films ever. Granted  that's not saying much(I made this conclusion after a whopping 15 minutes of watching). But I can truly say that Fire is also one of the really beautiful and brilliant films I've seen.<br /><br />Beautiful because of its imagery. The best example I can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads(Radha and Sita) and the characters of the same name in Hindu mythology. Sita  for example  is the wife of the revered Lord Ram. As legend goes  Ram subjugates his wife by making her walk through a Fire to prove her `purity.' Sita  in response  cries and leaves him  reuniting with her mother(the Earth). This story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the 2 Indian women(Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word `Fire' all of a sudden has many meanings - marriage  tradition  religion  motherhood  and probably a few others I didn't catch.<br /><br />Brilliant because of its social overtones. Many who were offended by the premise for this movie should in fact be first to see Fire(e.g. my mom  who actually loved it). Why? Because although Fire is an attack on tradition  it is also an attack on tradition. In other words  that is its strength  NOT its weakness. Traditional conservative social mores(whether Indian or Canadian or American or whatever) are useless if they enslave you. Gender roles and self-denial can both do this.<br /><br />These are the things I took with me after seeing Fire. Hats off to Deepa Mehta,positive
If you had asked me how the movie was throughout the film  I would have told you it was great! However  I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied. After thinking a little about it  I believe the problem was the pace of the ending. I feel that the majority of the movie moved kind of slow  and then the ending developed very fast. So  I would say the ending left me disappointed.<br /><br />I thought that the characters were well developed. Costner and Kutcher both portrayed their roles very well. Yes! Ashton Kutcher can act! Also  the different relationships between the characters seemed very real. Furthermore I thought that the different plot lines were well developed. Overall  it was a good movie and I would recommend seeing it.<br /><br />In conclusion: Good Characters  Great Plot  Poorly Written/Edited Ending. Still  Go See It!!!,positive
The movie is really about choices. In the oppressed state of affairs as seen in Fire  where good women had to be obedient and do what was correct in the eyes of tradition  there seemed few options for Radha and Sita. However  granted that it was not their only option. What is life without desire  Radha questions Ashok. Yes  it's true that life provides us with a number of options but how many we can take depends on a number of external factors. When your world is confined to a small Indian household  being a dutiful daughter-in-law to a silent but observant still powerful matriarch  a dutiful wife of 13 years to a man who has taken a vow of celibacy due to your not being able to have a child  a man who only wants you lying next to him to prove his strength in eliminating his desires. I felt the ladies had little choice but to find solace in each other's company. I guess the fact that so many women applauded Ms Mehta's work  was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves. An option to do what was perhaps unacceptable. The lesbian scenes I felt was merely to put that point across. Every scene in the movie from the first at the Taj Mahal to the last at the Mosque  is etched in my mind. How frustrating to be a prisoner of your feelings and desires. To feel that you had to forgo the human touch to be a dutiful wife just because it is expected of you. To have to suppress any desire you might have and to crave for the human touch. What then is the meaning of our existence one wonders. In the scene where Sita is crying alone in the room and Radha comes in to comfort her  their lips accidentally brush against each others and it awakens a feeling in them. Something they have both been deprived of.<br /><br />Bravo to Ms Mehta in translating her vision so clearly. I especially like the flashbacks to the young Radha trying to 'see' for the ocean. It is a metaphor for freedom. Freedom to choose  freedom to transport ourselves to places we would normally be unable to reach. In those scenes  it is gently told to us that her sense of duty has also been passed down from her mother who I assume lives within the rich Indian traditions of duty in marriage. The movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by A.R. Rahman. Since the film  I have become ardent fans of the two lead actresses and the director. I look forward to more of Ms Deepa's future productions.,positive
The theme is controversial and the depiction of the hypocritical and sexually starved india is excellent.Nothing more to this film.There is a lack of good dialogues(why was the movie in english??). There was lack of continuity and lack of passion/emotion in the acting.,positive
Deepa Mehta's Fire is groundbreaking  bold  and artistic. A masterful social commentary on the plight of the women from conservative  upper middle class Indian households  this is a film no one should miss. Shabana Azmi and Nandita Das give stellar performances by underplaying their characters as much as possible. A.R. Rahman's music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film. Mehta uses Rahman's score and together  they create such amazing sound montages that effectively portray the views of the world around Radha and Sita whenever they look to each other for support. This film is not about lesbianism as many have branded it. Lesbianism is just a part of the film. It is unfortunate that most people tend to write the film off calling it taboo instead of giving it a chance and looking at its real meaning.,positive
My boyfriend and I went to watch The Guardian.At first I didn't want to watch it  but I loved the movie- It was definitely the best movie I have seen in sometime.They portrayed the USCG very well  it really showed me what they do and I think they should really be appreciated more.Not only did it teach but it was a really good movie. The movie shows what the really do and how hard the job is.I think being a USCG would be challenging and very scary. It was a great movie all around. I would suggest this movie for anyone to see.The ending broke my heart but I know why he did it. The storyline was great I give it 2 thumbs up. I cried it was very emotional  I would give it a 20 if I could!,positive
For all that has been said about the subject matter  and the controversy that surrounded it  please do not overlook what I feel to be the most important part of the film: the salient struggles of everyone to keep their pride through their trials. Whether dealing with self-imposed male braggadocio  a sexual reawakening  or even life itself  everybody is human.,positive
'Water' (2005)  the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director Deepa Mehta's elemental trilogy has been finally completed  almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element  'Fire' (1996)  which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998). Mehta made her directorial debut with a 24-minute Canadian short film 'At 99: A Portrait of Louise Tandy Murch' (1975)  but it was her Canadian feature film about the life of Indians living in Canada that brought her fame back in east  her country by birthright  'Sam & Me' (1991). Recognition internationally came in the way of 'Camilla' (1994)  starring Bridget Fonda  along with the actress who in 1990 won an Oscar in Best Actress in a Leading Role category at the age of 80  paving the way for middle-aged actresses to still have hope  for her portrayal of a stubborn old Jewish woman in 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989)  late Jessica Tandy. <br /><br />'Camilla' dealt with a friendship between two women from two other ends of the human lifespan  a May/December friendship. 'Camilla' was Tandy's last picture; she died the very same year.<br /><br />International fame followed Deepa Mehta in 1996 with the release of the controversial 'Fire'  which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing Indian extremist. Having already explored friendship between two women in 'Camilla'  in 'Fire' Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women. Set in modern day India  the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi  it shows two brothers and their wives  the elder brother (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) having joined a weird Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy  faithful to his guru of sexless existence. The younger brother (Javed Jaffrey) is having an extra marital affair with a Chinese woman (Alice Poon). Thus  both the wives  Shabana Azmi playing the elder brothers wife and Nandita Das the younger wife  find themselves neglected in their own way. One forced to lead a celibate life  thanks to her husband's eccentricities  and the other whose only interaction with her husband is through sex  and nothing more. Living in a world of in-laws and being the only two outsiders in the family  having nobody else to confide in  the two women fall in the arms of each other. Thus comes the issue of lesbianism. If there were an outside man's shoulder to cry on  there most probably would have been chance for them to fall into the arms of a man  but having no one else to confide in  their need for each others support is quite obvious. It does not necessarily state that all neglected women would end up taking lesbianism  it just happened to exist with regard to the two women in this context. All in all  the movie is excellent  and delves far deeper than just two women rolling in bed. The key focus isn't lesbianism in the movie  but the plight of modern day neglected Indian wives  even in the capital city  the two female characters just happen to have a sexual relationship. <br /><br />Two years later  Deepa Mehta's second installment was the element of mother earth  released in India by the name of '1947: Earth' yet another excellent movie by a great director  this time in the Hindi language  unlike 'Fire'  which was made in the English language. <br /><br />Now Deepa Mehta has managed to complete the trilogy  despite a lot of problems  having released the final installment recently  'Water'. No doubt it would be just as great as the other two.,positive
This was a bold movie to hit Indian cinemas when it was released. The first movie to perhaps openly depict lesbian tendencies amongst Indian women. The leading actress of Indian cinema Shabana Azmi added substance to the movie with her hot passionate scenes with Nandita Das.<br /><br />The movie oozed with sexuality and the director used sex in the best way possible. The sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie. The scene where Nandita Das loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas.<br /><br />Good acting by all the actors especially Nandita Das amidst criticism from the Indian public,positive
I admire Deepa Mehta and this movie is a masterpiece. I'd recommend to buy this movie on DVD because it's a movie you might want to watch more often than just once. And trust me  you'd still find little meaningful details after watching it several times.<br /><br />The characters - except for the grandmother perhaps - are all very balanced  no black and white. Even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists  there is also empathy for the other characters.<br /><br />I think the IMDb rating for the movie is far too low - probably due to its politically controversial content.,positive
Its a very sensitive portrayal of life with unquenched or constrained desires. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? One husband finds outlet with the immigrant - since immigrants don't belong or aren't accepted  they don't need to conform and dam their desires. The other husband looks for solace in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothingness. It fails - of course - and he breaks down in the last scene for multiple reasons. Sita still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires. The mother in her still couldn't find the strength to destroy his myth. She sees him as a child who is glorifying himself in his lust-control but should she give him the opportunity to finally grow up? Both the wives find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband. <br /><br />But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept Sita's desire. A decade and more of receiving care was not enough to break the shackles of her culture.<br /><br />Seems like it was easiest for the househelp to let his desires flow - since he's anyway damned by his culture - being at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is anyway no respect and expectations  might as well taste sin.,positive
It is more a subtle story of the fact that in Indian household how most decisions are taken by the man  how no attention is paid to the desires of the lady  for example how even when the husband and wife sleep together it would be a test for the husband whether he can control his desires  not to give the woman pleasure. And in such a type of scenario  women invariably have two choices  either to accept all this and take it into their own life  which is usually the case or not accept this and try to mould things to satisfy themselves  which makes a movie!<br /><br />Fire is a brilliantly directed story of the second option  which women choose for themselves  no sacrifice  not to serve anybody else  rather a decision for their own good. Somehow the whole idea of justifying lesbianism didn't find an acceptance in the Indian audience but if one looks the whole movie from an angle of self-expression  then the whole debate doesn't even arise.,positive
While the romance in this film is an important aspect  it is largely about the role of responsibility and duty in modern Indian. All of the major characters were well fleshed out  and had their own inner life. I recommend this strongly,positive
one of best movies ever...Fire...it is not much about sociological description of India today...it is the mind blowing use of light that never stops  never becomes...normal...even when...in this sense the movie is almost unique...both leads are of very good quality...the origin of Das as a street performer are pretty obvious...her performance is a superb cammeo...but the use of the light...I have look at it and looked at it  again and again...still mind blowing after ages...nothing torrid in the story...rather pure way of facing the subject...in a way it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today  a major art work is usually known as a gender film...Fire can stand face to face with Dryer's Jeanne D' Arc or Ichikawa's Biruma no Tategoto or some of the major Kurosawa movies  just to name some. Wish my input could help a little this movie to its deserved way to fame.,positive
I was looking forward to The Guardian  but when I walked into the theater I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it  but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. The trailers looked good  but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. Plus  despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect  I'm still not completely sold on him. Something about the guy just annoys me. Probably has to do with his simian features.<br /><br />It took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away. The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission  and I was gripped tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange face lift. My concerns briefly bristled at Kutcher's initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses  a tough guy toothpick in his mouth  and sportin' a smirk that'd make George Clooney proud? Yeah  we get it. I was totally ready to hate him.<br /><br />But then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs. <br /><br />Darn you  ape man! Efficiently mixing tense  exciting rescue scenes  drama  humor  and solid acting  The Guardian is easily a film that I dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy. You can quibble about its clichés  predictability  and rare moments of overcooked sappiness  but none of that takes away from the entertainment value.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner started training the young guys  but on the contrary  the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film. Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen  so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under-appreciated group.<br /><br />Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it -you get to go on dangerous missions in cold  dark  rough water  and then you must fight disorientation  exhaustion  hypothermia  and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded  panicked people who are depending on you for their survival. And if all that isn't bad enough  sometimes you can't save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies.<br /><br />Man  who wants all that responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what it was really like for these guys  and who would have thought I'd have an Ashton Kutcher/Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education? <br /><br />Not only does The Guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero  but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers.<br /><br />THE GIST <br /><br />Moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it's like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free  but had I paid I would've felt I had gotten my money's worth.,positive
I finally watched the third film in Mehta's trilogy: Fire. To begin  I'd say that Water was the unquestionable masterpiece  on all levels. Fire comes next with Earth close behind in order of quality. Fire: there is so much going on in this film that I'll need a few more viewings to drink it all in. The writing is superb  the script creating friction that starts the entire process of heat from the beginning until the end when it really does erupt into a fire  the conflicts moving into complete rupture of relationships. <br /><br />Mehta is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced  false and repressive about the great society from which she came from. India is rapidly changing these days but much of this is economic change. That she met with such ferocious opposition to the making of Water after having had the script cleared  shows that there are still many taboo subjects which Indian people more than less cannot look squarely in the face  cannot examine or discuss them. Worse  if someone like Mehta has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues  she faces death threats. So  as much as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic  tolerant society  the facts are not always so. Whereas Earth was merely a historical setting of the carnage of the civil war after Indian independence  Fire and Water are pointing at personal  social and religious issues  which as I say are considered so strongly (in a negative sense) that an open artistic dialog is still many years away. As I write this Water is scheduled to actually be shown in India later this year. I'll believe it when I see it. <br /><br />Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional conundrum that I saw in A price above rubies. Whether it's arranged marriages (which it used to be like among Jews about 150 years ago  or like it is among many modern Indians)  they have the risk of having a bad match forced upon both men and women; or  just plain loveless marriages..... However  this is not the real issue. Mehta is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire). I am no expert regarding either the secular or Hindu laws concerning divorce. The film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce)is almost as bad as the sad marriage. In any case Mehta's film is a very moving  powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny. That all three of these films have made themselves felt in India as an unwarranted attack on their culture sounds to me like the predictable clamor of a repressive mindset. Mehta is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack. I admire her work and cannot highly recommend her films enough. Superb  disturbing  provocative  taboo shattering.,positive
There are questions that sometimes hover over us and have no answer. Two women progressively find themselves ensnared in each other's arms (as corny as the expression sounds  that is exactly what happens) and fins that they cannot answer their own question as to what defines their relationship when their very own society has no name to what they are. Deepa Mehta's somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy  here linked by the theme of the elements  and more symbolic than consuming. Fire as uncontrolled erotic passion does not make an appearance here  since the women -- the older and more feminine Radha (Shabana Azmi) and the younger  more masculine tempered Sita (Nandita Das) come to realize they share a lot more than common ideas and affection for each other and stand for what they believe is their passion for each other despite the opposition faced by their very traditional husbands and families. As in WATER  FIRE is deeply spiritual  even if it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama (where WATER  much like the weight of the word  carries a stronger meaning that ultimately transcends its definition). Even so  it's a very beautiful picture  and a strong voice from a strong director.,positive
Now I do understand that this film was not meant as an indictment against all Indians but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some Indians have concerning their women and sexuality. I have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society (with women being murdered because the husband's family doesn't want them any more after his death or because she had a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing). I also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film  but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter--even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in India a decade ago. As a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie  most Western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this film.<br /><br />Although I am a male  am not rabidly feminist and I am straight  the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is NOT an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by Lesbians and man haters. In fact  I don't think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a credibly argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands. Yes  I use the word wicked and mean it  as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their spouses' sexuality. In many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence.<br /><br />One husband married a vivacious young woman  Sita  out of family obligation. This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning Sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband. However  he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about Sita--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady. To make matters worse  he did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies. In their dead marriage  sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way Sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met. And unfortunately  he could have cared less.<br /><br />Another husband was married to a lady who was infertile (Radha). Oddly  after initially trying to have children  they have gone the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever! It's because this man has decided to become an ascetic (i.e.  in Hinduism  a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment). Now his wanting to do this was all well and good IF he was not already married and had obligations for his wife. However  being married  this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother  he assumed his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care. The closest he would allow her to him sexually was to sleep next to him--as having her next to him helped teach himself to overcome the desires of the flesh. This must have brought nothing but frustration to her.<br /><br />So  you've got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs. Eventually  these needs bring these sister-in-laws together--at first  just emotionally but later sexually as well. The movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolation.<br /><br />Late in the film  when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered  it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from Radha's enlightened husband--a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossible.<br /><br />This is a very challenging and adult film. While there is very little nudity  the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids. Very disturbing indeed is one minor character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady--as I said  this is NOT a film to let your kids watch. However  for a mature audience  this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to think.<br /><br />The film features good acting  complex characters  excellent writing  lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some  but which I found rewarding. The only serious negative I cannot blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on videotape. This is because although the movie is in English  the accents are quite strong at times and it's not always easy to understand what's being said. BUT  and this is the worst part  there are no closed or open captions--including them is a must for Western audiences. If you do watch this film  see if you can find it on DVD or hopefully a newer release on video will have captioning--mine sure didn't.<br /><br />By the way  director Deepa Mehta (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood. A consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and Westernism--with a strong emphasis on female characters. Not surprisingly  this West-thinking lady makes her home in Canada and is divorced--a truly unusual woman to say the least. For a similar film that explores traditional culture meets Western culture  try another Canadian gem  EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN.,positive
Overall  a well done movie. There were the parts that made me wince  and there were the parts that I threw my hands up at  but I came away with something more than I gone in with.<br /><br />I think the movie suffers from some serious excess ambition. Without spoiling it  let me say that the obvious references to the trial by fire in Ramayana  is way beyond what this movie stands for. The Ramayana is an epic. Not a 200 page book that puts down women in India. The movie is about two girls married into a very distinctive Indian family. While the basic tenets of the unwritten laws of the family tradition seem to be that of conservative India  let me assure my reader that I (having lived in Delhi for 12 years) found entire parts that just did not ring those bells. I mean some things and some actions are very true  but some other stuff is just way off the mark. Especially today.<br /><br />Delhi is complicated. India is complicated. The director tries to simplify both. And fails pretty miserably at that.<br /><br />Why in English? Can you imagine a movie about American Indians in English. Or the French speaking in English. Seriously jarring. Even the servant spoke in fluent accented English (albeit with a hint of colloquialisms in the language for believability).<br /><br />But the chemistry between the leads is palpable. If you like it hot  this is a movie for you. I think that is the biggest saving grace - the development of a true real life love story.<br /><br />If this film was about Radha and Sita  then it would have got full marks from me. And in being about them  it could have made a subtle statement. But this movie goes out there to say this is what India is  and this is what Indian society is like. And in that respect it succeeds as much as it fails. Just take everything you see with a pinch of salt. The dark secrets of India are not being revealed. Just two girls are falling in love. Just like it happens everywhere else.,positive
A stunningly well-made film  with exceptional acting  directing  writing  and photography.<br /><br />A newlywed finds married life not what she expected  and starts to question her duty to herself versus her duty to society. Together with her sister -in-law  she makes some radical departures from conventional roles and mores.,positive
This was a great film in every sense of the word. It tackles the subject of tribadism in a society that is quite intolerant of any deviations from the norm. It criticises a great many Indian customs that many find oppressive -- such as the arranging of marriages by others  the importance of status and face  religious hypocrisy  sexism  the valuation of women in terms of their baby-making capacity  the binding concepts of duty and so on. At the heart of the film is a touching love story that goes beyond such limitations of the society which the two protagonists find themselves. The film is well-acted and genuine  completely believable from beginning to end  unlike most Bollywood flicks. The main faults of the film as I saw it was first  that the two lovers seem drawn to one another not necessarily by a natural affinity for each other as much as the fact that they are stuck in dead-end marriages with no passion and no rewards. This may play a part in the sexual awakening of the characters  but most people stuck in the same situation will not turn homosexual. It seems clear from the beginning of the film that the two characters are quite heterosexual -- when Radha does her scene at the end of the movie with Aashok  she makes it quite clear that without desire she was dead  and the implication was that if he had desired so  he could have fulfilled her quite completely  and also when Sita seemed very disappointed when her husband seemed to not like her. Such situations do not turn people into homosexuals -- they may seek comfort in others in the same position  but inthe film it is not at all made clear that they are lesbians from the beginning -- quite the opposite. Some people are bisexual  it is true  but most tend to be either hetero- or homosexual. In the case of the ladies in the film  both had insensitive jerks for husbands . . . if this had not been the case  would they have naturally found the need to express their desire in a relationship that they may have otherwise not have considered? The film ignores this. The other fault is the naming of the characters . . . the names Sita and Radha seem contrived deliberately to shock and outrage (imagine a film in America depicting a gay relationship between a man named Jesus and another named Paul!) by using names associated with various Hindoo scriptures. The film is strong enough to stand on its own and needs no such devices in my opinion. At any rate  the faults do not take much away from the power of the movie. It is indeed a very touching and powerful story -- the images and characters will stay with you a long time after you leave the theatre.,positive
This is my first Deepa Mehta film. I saw the film on TV in its Hindi version with its Sita character presented as Nita. I also note that it is Radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita/Sita. Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by Ms Mehta  not her direction. The characters  big and small  were well-developed and seemed quixotic towards the end--somewhat like the end of Mazursky's An Unmarried Woman. They are brave women surrounded by cardboard men. And one cardboard man (Ashok) seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him---carrying his invalid mother Biji. He seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion. <br /><br />Ms Mehta seems to fumble as a director (however  compared to most Indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant) as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the Chinese micro-minority in the social milieu of India. She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!) Yet her Radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field. Compare her to Mrinal Sen  Adoor Gopalakrishnan  Muzaffar Ali and she is dwarfed by these giants--given her competent Canadian production team and financial resources! Mehta's film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some  but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space. Kannada  Malayalam  and Bengali films have touched parallel themes in India but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers.<br /><br />Ms Das  Ms Azmi  Mr Jafri and Mr Kharbanda are credible but not outstanding. Ms Azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors (Mrinal Sen's Khandar  Gautam Ghose's Paar  Benegal's Ankur) a brilliance notably absent in this film. Ms Das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability. All in all  the film's strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema. I am sure Ms Mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays.,positive
CONTAINS SPOILER INFORMATION. Watch this director's other film  Earth  at some point. It's a better film  but this one isn't bad just different.<br /><br />A rare feminist point of view from an Indian filmmaker. Tradition  rituals  duty  secrets  and the portrayal of strict sex roles make this an engaging and culturally dynamic film viewing experience. All of the married characters lack the fire of the marriage bed with their respective spouses. One husband is celibate and commits a form of spiritual adultery by giving all of his love  honor  time and respect to his religious swami (guru). His wife is lonely and yearns for intimacy and tenderness which she eventually finds with her closeted lesbian sister-in-law who comes to live in their house with her unfaithful husband. This unfaithful husband is openly in love with his Chinese mistress but was forced into marriage with a (unbeknownest to him) lesbian. They only have sex once when his closet lesbian wife loses her virginity.<br /><br />A servant lives in the house and he eventually reveals the secret that the two women are lovers. Another significant character is the elderly matriarch who is unable to speak or care for herself due to a stroke. However  she uses a ringing bell to communicate her needs as well as her displeasure with the family members. She lets them know through her bell or by pounding her fist that she knows exacly what's going on in the house and how much she disapproves.<br /><br />In the end  the truth about everybody comes out and the two female lovers end up running away together. But  not before there is an emotional scene between the swami-addicted husband and his formerly straight wife. Her sari catches on fire and at first we think she is going to die. However  we see the two women united in the very last scene of the movie.<br /><br />The writer/director of this film challenges her culture's traditions  but she shows us individual human beings who are trapped by their culture and gender. We come to really care about the characters and we don't see them as stereotypes. Each on surprises us with their humanity  vulgarity  tenderness  anger  and spirit.,positive
Previous reviewer Claudio Carvalho gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could. What I recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful  in every sense - emotionally  visually  editorially - just gorgeous.<br /><br />If you like movies that are wonderful to look at  and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant  I think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art.<br /><br />On a scale of 1 to 10  I'd give it about an 8.75. The only reason I shy away from 9 is that it is a mood piece. If you are in the mood for a really artistic  very romantic film  then it's a 10. I definitely think it's a must-see  but none of us can be in that mood all the time  so  overall  8.75.,positive
It's worth boning up on the Hindu pantheon before watching this film. Three main female deities -- wise Sita  nurturing Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer -- as well as three main male deities -- grave Rama  playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender -- are all alluded to. Knowing the folklore as surely every Indian member of an audience does lends a richness to the telling of the present-day story. In fact  one folktale is enacted first on stage  as part of a lesson in spirituality  and then in the movie's real life. Fire speaks out against the misogyny and homophobia in the society to which its producers are native  and it does so with a beauty that weaves the message into multiple levels of the viewer's awareness  making it a deeply satisfying presentation. This is the finest film i've seen in the past ten years; very highly recommended!,positive
This intelligent  moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of William Faulkner's novels).<br /><br />The characters all feel trapped by the weight of the roles they are expected to assume  and seek for a way to live within those roles rather than throw them off altogether. But as the story develops the two wives  trapped in loveless marriages  draw together. Drawing on the strength of their friendship and love  they give each other the courage to abandon their roles.<br /><br />They have found that living within their traditions is no life at all  it is a sort of living death: without passion  without true connection to others  without fulfillment. Although they know there will be a price to be paid for their rebellion and freedom  it is a price much less dear than the sacrifice called for by a comfortable  predictable existence.<br /><br />The screenplay is wonderful  the acting marvelous. Near perfect!,positive
I was pleasantly surprised to find this movie showing as a sneak preview in my local theater.<br /><br />We have all seen this plot line before (Top Gun  GI Jane  An Officer and a Gentleman) but a good script still works. This story is basically about the training of a Coast Guard rescue team with a couple of side story lines. Kevin Costner plays a highly successful rescue team leader  Ben Randall  who is forced into heading the training team after a tough mission. The movie takes us through the rigors of the training process and the personal stories of both the Costner character and that of Jake Fischer  played by Ashton Kutcher. I am happy to say that Ashton is great in this part.<br /><br />There are no great surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what is coming long before it arrives. However  the use of humor  the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching Ben Randall do his own thing as a trainer  kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained. I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the entire audience laugh out loud  gasp here and there  and clap at the end as a tribute to the movie.<br /><br />We all had a good time (despite a couple of tough moments in the movie)and  I think  you will too.,positive
The thing which makes Fire even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry  is its touch of femininism and rebellion. To my mind  the very character played by Shabana Azmi is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society. The name of the movie and the scene when Radha walks through flames in her kitchen are symbloic of Hindu Mythology's Lord Rama's wife Sita's walking through fire for the proof of her immaculacy  as per the same narrative which appears in the film too. The film could be a great inspiration for women  particularly those in the subcontinent  to search for their liberties and to attain control of their lives.,positive
A fairly interesting look at some characters from India's burgeoning middle class. Although India is rapidly modernizing  her culture is not keeping up. This film involves the patriarchal society  where women are not yet truly free citizens. A land of arranged marriages  men who dally with mistresses with total impunity  and women who are expected to tolerate all this  will eventually come up short. I was impressed with Nandita Das  who was quite attractive  and played her character with total earnestness. But I was even more impressed with Shabana Azmi  who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood. Her quiet beauty and low-key psychic suffering was excellent. The lesbian subtext of this film was never particularly erotic  and never titillating. (Darn!) Worth a look for those interested in vastly different cultures.,positive
This film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition. All this against a backdrop of an India which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values. This film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front. It is easy to see why Fire has caused riots in India  but tragic nonetheless. A true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world  not just privileged westerners.,positive
SPOILER ALERT! Don't read on unless you're prepared for some spoilers.<br /><br />I think this film had a lot beneath its shell. Besides the apparent connections with Oldboy (and Park-wook's other films)  an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me  and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric  physical action.<br /><br />The main actor  Kang-ho Song  is terrific in the rôle of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally  sang means blood in some languages - who truly loved Tae-ju  played by OK-bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in Badlands  where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger.<br /><br />Their relationship is one thing  but the girl's mother is entirely different. While moving  she is stiff  one-dimensional and taut  but paralysed  she says all through not moving  or through the wink of an eye.<br /><br />Park-wook has really  really mastered his cinematography in this film  and owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film  some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.<br /><br />The music is quite stock  using mostly strings to accompany the main thespian's monoreaction; it's a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is. While he does very little and loses at that  he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot. While his love-interest says and does a lot  her actions display very little thought behind it. In my humble opinion.<br /><br />All in all  a very disturbing film that is not made for action  which isn't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days; it's magnificent  and repellant at the same time.,positive
(This has been edited for space)<br /><br />Chan-wook Park's new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify. Nominally a horror movie  the central character is a vampire  the film actually has elements of comedy  theology  melodrama  cultural invasion (and its analog of viral invasion of a body)  romance and few other things as well. It's a film that has almost too much on its mind. The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature  in this case Emile Zola's Thérèse Raquin. It's an odd mix that doesn't always gel  but none the less has an incredible power. Here it is almost 24 hours since I saw the film at Lincoln Center (with a post film discussion by the director) and I find my cage is increasingly rattled. Its not so much what happens is bothersome  its more that its wide reaching story and its themes ring a lot of bells in retrospect.<br /><br />The plot of the film has a will loved priest deciding that the best way to help mankind is to volunteer for a medical experiment to find a cure for a terrible disease. Infected with the disease he eventually succumbs and dies  but because of a transfusion of vampiric blood (its not explained) he actually survives. Hailed as a miracle worker the priest returns to the hospital where he had been ministering to the sick. Unfortunately all is not well. The priest finds that he needs blood to survive. He also finds that he has all of the typical problems of a vampire  and its no not possible for him to go out during the day. Things become even more complicated when he becomes reacquainted with a childhood friend and his family. The priest  some of his animal passions awakened becomes taken with the wife of his friend. From there it all goes sideways.<br /><br />An ever changing film  this is a story that spins through a variety of genres as it tells the very human story of a man who finds that his life has been radically altered by a chance event and finds that he is no longer who he thought he was. It's a film that you have to stay with to the end because the film is forever evolving into something else. Its also a film that has a great deal on its mind and the themes its playing with are constantly being explored in a variety of ways<br /><br />The film has enough going on that one could  and people probably will  write books discussing the film.<br /><br />The two of the strongest parts of the film are its vampiric elements and its romance The vampire part of the tale is brilliant. There is something about how it lays out the ground rules and the nature of the affliction that makes such perfect sense that it kind of pushes the old vampire ideas aside. Sitting in the theater last night I found myself amazed at how impressed how well it worked. I think the fact that it played more or less straight is what is so earth shaking. Here is a vampire who just wants to have a normal life. It's contrasted with what happens later  it makes clear that living an existence of hunting humans really isn't going to work. Its not the dark world of Twilight or Lost Boys  rather its something else. I personally think that the film changes the playing field from a hip cool idea or dream into something more real and tangible. (The sequence where the powers kick in is just way cool) The romance is also wonderfully handled. Sure the sex scenes are steamy and well done  but it's the other stuff  the looks  the talk  the gestures outside of the sex that makes this special. I love the looks  the quiet stares as the forbidden couple look at each other hungering for each other and unable to act  the disappointment and heartbreak of betrayal both real and suspected  and the mad passion of possible consummation. This is one of the great screen romances of all time. It perfectly captures the feeling and emotion of deep passionate love (and lust). If you've ever loved deeply I'm guessing you'll find some part of your hear on screen  I know I did. The statement I just wanted to spend eternity with you has a sad poignancy to it. It's both a statement of what was the intention as well as the depth of emotion. The tragic romance will break your heart. <br /><br />I won't lie to you and say that the film is perfect and great. Its not  as good as the pieces are and almost all of them are great (especially the actors who I have unjustly failed to hail as amazing) the whole doesn't always come together. The various genres  thematic elements and tones occasionally grate against each other. Frequently I was wondering where the film was going. I hung in there even though the film seemed to be wandering about aimlessly.<br /><br />I liked the film a great deal. I loved the pieces more than the film as a whole. Its been pinging around in my head since I saw it  and I'm guessing that it will do so for several days more. Like or love is irrelevant since this is a film that really should be seen since it has so much going on that it will provide you with enough material to think and talk about for days afterward. One of the meatiest and most filling films of the year.,positive
The cinematography is the film's shining feature. Park really knows his stuff when it comes to shooting memorable scenes from behind a camera. Every shot is filled with vibrant colors that leap off of the screen. Every frame of the film seems to tell a story all on its own. I hope there's a Blu-ray release of this film because it will look fantastic. It's rather intriguing to see which elements of the vampire mythology Park used for his vision. Sang-hyeon has to drink blood to survive and to stay looking flawless  has incredible strength  and is vulnerable to sunlight. He doesn't  however  have fangs and also has a reflection in the mirror.<br /><br />Although I've never seen the film  I couldn't help but feel like this was Chan-wook Park's version of Twilight. The entire middle portion of the film is devoted to Sang-hyeon's and Tae-Joo's love for one another. It felt like the adult version of Twilight  really. There's a lot of blood  nudity  sex  and even a few obscenities thrown in for good measure. Maybe it's the Chan-Wook Park fanboy in me  but I honestly feel like I can guarantee that this is the better film of the two. The psychological aspect that I love about Park's previous films is in Thirst  as well. That's a major factor for me as any film that causes me to think or is unusual in any way winds up becoming a fan favorite. The soundtracks to Park's films always seem to fit its respective film like a glove. Thirst is no exception. While the soundtrack is a bit more subtle this time around  it fit the overall atmosphere of the film rather effortlessly.<br /><br />The middle portion of the film did seem to drag on longer than everything else in the film. It's weird though as the scenes during that time are crucial to the storyline of the film and it's hard to imagine Thirst being the same film if any of those scenes were cut. Nevertheless  it is my one nitpick of the film.<br /><br />Chan-wook Park bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark  psychological twist on it. Park's films always seem to have a specific formula or include most of the following: great writing  beautiful cinematography  a solid cast  some sort of psychological twist that'll mess with your head  and a memorable ending. Thirst delivers on all fronts and will hopefully get more of the attention it deserved during its theatrical run on DVD (and eventually Blu-ray  hopefully).,positive
I wasn't expecting much because of the harsh reviews  and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result. Softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films  in my opinion  allowed the narrative to take the focus. Though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace  I felt like many of the other things were not. For example:<br /><br />how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her.<br /><br />the very strong and well acted love scenes.<br /><br />the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even more.<br /><br />Their strong differences of what it means to be 'vampire' created by their prior life experiences.<br /><br />the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie.<br /><br />I've heard and read several things about 'tricks used in other films'. Of course. However  i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and I feel that he does this well. I don't need a director to use new tricks. I prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately  which i feel is the case with this film. <br /><br />I recommend it.,positive
Anything Park Chan-wook creates is guaranteed to be unique  brilliant  and very twisted at a minimum. Well  anything that isn't I'm a Cyborg at least. Park's newest film titled Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy-drama  yes  that is a lot of adjectives  inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola titled Therese Raquin. Park creates a uniquely Korean  and uniquely Park  vision of the vampire mythos and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest discovering himself having a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that would develop. Park delivers on the elements you would hope but definitely falls short of masterpiece quality like Oldboy or even that of Lady Vengeance. Heavily bloated with a narrative that often loses itself much less the audience  Thirst desperately needed another trip through the cutting room. It crawls when it should be running but luckily brings it back home before losing the audience completely. As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of Park Chan-wook film.<br /><br />Check out the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com,positive
Although at times I was the only one in the cinema who was laughing  this is the main pleasure I took from the beautifully shot Thirst - laughter. Although sometimes it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis and didn't know whether it was a tragedy or a comedy  the blackest of black humour shone through at regular intervals. <br /><br />It helped of course that it the standard of acting by everyone concerned was wonderful  and that I was slightly obsessed by the at times wicked leading lady  who was gorgeously elegant no matter how blood soaked and malevolent she became.<br /><br />I read reviews that suggested this movie was overlong. I didn't think so. In fact the last scenes  moving and hilarious (I mean  the brown shoes....) by turns  were among the best in the film.,positive
They say that it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the imagination of the viewer- to hide certain details from the audience in order to tickle their sense of imagination  dip into their fears and let that give birth to their darkest thoughts.<br /><br />That was not the case when I watched Bakjwi  under the American title Thirst. Now playing at select theaters near you. Seems like the film makers did not want to spare you any details. There WILL be blood in this film and you WILL try to look away.<br /><br />For rest of review please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi.html Thanks and hope you enjoyed reading above.,positive
I work at a movie theater and every Thursday night we have an employee screening of one movie that comes out the next day...Today it was The Guardian. I saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it  and in no way really did i anticipate seeing this movie. Well turns out this movie was a lot more than I would have thought. It was a great story first of all. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner did amazing acting work in this film. Being a big fan of That 70's Show I always found it hard thinking of Kutcher as anyone but Kelso despite the great acting he did in The Butterfly Effect  but after seeing this movie I think I might be able to finally look at him as a serious actor.<br /><br />It was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the U.S. Coast Guard.,positive
The definition of a vampire is an inhumane corpse supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwi nearly nails this concept on the head minus the cliché of pointy fangs and neck biting. Being an R rated movie  I knew this was actually going to pertain to vampires actually being vampires. Which means that the characters in the movie are going to do what vampires actually do without restraint and rightfully lack any glamorous moments in comparison to Twilight. Having viewed Chan-wook Park's preceding Oldboy  I had very high expectations of Bakjwi.<br /><br />I anticipated some awkward plot sequences with our anti-hero  known as Priest Sang-hyeon  and was very impressed by his performance as a holy-man who is forced into this quandary of being humane and obeying his thirst as a vampire. (SPOILER) After the initial premise of him surviving the defective blood transfusion  he starts to crave blood and discovers his super strength and his flying ability. The screen shots do his transition phase without overbearing on exposition. He starts drinking the blood of the dying and those who wish to be euthanized for moral reasons. The oft tragic and dysfunctional love affair the priest has with the manipulative Tae-joo is very riveting as they are played by The Host's Kanh-ho Song and actress OK-vin Kim. The special effects are properly placed in the backdrop and while it doesn't offer anything new in the ways of stunts and CGI  it didn't impose itself into the plot driven and character developed premise. The story and the pivotal plot points are very perverse and grotesque yet very original in its own Korean style. <br /><br />There aren't many negatives I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I ask myself if the priests transition phase could have showed more of the priest having an emotional crisis with his transformation  but then again this would have made the movie 3 hours long. The movie was long to begin with. On the same token  vampires really don't have much in the way of expressing emotions to begin with. As mentioned before  this movie is very tragic  so don't expect anything hopeful while watching this. <br /><br />Overall  Bakjwi is delightfully dark  morbid and original. I strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are past the teenage phase of Twilight. This is definitely the Korean answer to the Swedish Let The Right One In  which is also a good movie.,positive
i hate vampire movies. with that said  this one was very interesting to me. i do want to point out one thing tho. bakjwi literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories  you see count Dracula or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva. We also know that bats are mammals that can fly thus many categorizes them to be exceptional. As I watched the film  I realized that the theme of bat is deeply embedded in this movie more than just to make the bat-vampire connection.<br /><br />Duality of human nature = if you ever read aesop's fables  there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage. Mammals and birds find out what this bat has been doing and banish the bat out of their lands at the end of the story.<br /><br />the two contradicting sides of human nature are constantly at battle throughout the film ex. sang-hyun's blind priest friend  sang-hyun's effort to quench thirst and his sexual desire  tae-ju playing both sides  her ordinary boring life vs. her thrill seeking vampire adventure  etc (won't ruin too much  u have to watch the film) and this theme is beautifully presented on a plate with delicious sides of romance  sex  violence  religion  dark-comedy tragedy  vengeance  you name it!<br /><br />i feel like many would find this movie boring and too long  but this film is very fresh and new  something that i haven't seen b4 yet. I wouldn't say this is CW Park's best work  but it is mos. def. the strangest to comprehend yet darkly intriguing!,positive
We all know what Chan-wook Park can do. If you haven't seen Oldboy(or the sympathy trilogy for that matter) you are missing out on some of the best films made this century. But i'm not here to talk about them. I'm here to talk about thirst.<br /><br />This movie is not what you would expect. Yes it is a vampire movie  but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl. I wont get into the synopsis(you can read that above) but instead tell you what this movie has to offer. Chan-wook Park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception. With some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting  he sets the mood perfectly in almost every scene. The movie does start a bit slow  but I felt this was necessary to build a relationship with the characters. Once things start moving along it almost never lets up until the credits roll. Thirst is predominantly a love story  but not in the same sense that you would think. the relationship between the lead characters is very intense  but at the same time almost disturbing. Chan-wook Park is no stranger to controversy as we know  and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy. The end scene is by far the most powerful in the movie  and perhaps one of the best conclusions to a film I have seen.<br /><br />Overall this is an exceptional film that I feel all movie buffs should see. It is an exciting(and admittedly different) take on the world of vampires  and the romance is far from sappy or boring. This movie is gritty  selfless  and beautiful in all the wrong ways. Obviously it is not for everyone  but chances are if you are reading this review you are already interested. See it. Do not hesitate,positive
I'm the first to recognize that Chan-wook Park's Thirst is exceptionally well made  but spending over two hours with Tae-joo(OK-vin Kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time. Sang-hyeon(Kang-ho Song)is a priest desiring to volunteer for experimental studies on those willing to subject themselves to rigorous injections concerning a specific virus which kills infectiously. Instead of legitimately dying  Hyeon becomes a vampire  always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores  and the body vomits blood). Sunlight  as is known in the vampire genre  causes torturous death if exposed to Hyeon for a length of time. Hyeon falls in lust with Tae-joo  the wife of sickly childhood friend Kang-woo(Ha-kyun Shin). Tae-joo was taken in by Mrs. Ra(Hae-sook Kim)  regarded as a puppy  and practically used as a domestic animal to be ordered around. Ta-joo is miserable in this situation and begins a torrid affair she instigates with Hyeon  soon manipulating him into perhaps killing Kang-woo by having him believe she's a victim of abuse. Renouncing his priesthood  Hyeon dives headlong into the relationship with Tae-joo  soon a willing participant in killing Kang-woo. This incident  which Tae-woo contributed to(..using a boat  in the middle of a lake  both proceeded to burying him underwater  Tae-woo keeping him Kang-woo from re-surfacing as he attempted to re-enter)will haunt both  as circumstances arise with Kang-woo missing(Hyeon got rid of him  where police would not find his corpse). Soon Mrs Ra suffers a stroke(..though  one finger and the ability to blink her eyes contribute mightily as the story progresses  showing that she more aware than they are led to believe)  and Hyeon gives Tae-joo a special birthday gift..vampirism. In doing so  Hyeon has created a monster. Tae-joo admits(..though a slip of the tongue)that  in fact  Kang-woo never hurt her  and as she thirsts for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesn't bother her morally or psychologically. Tae-joo becomes such a hand full  Hyeon has to take desperate measures if he is to stop such a menace to society  himself included.<br /><br />I will say that Thirst is one of the best horror films I've seen regarding 2009. It's a methodical approach Park takes and we are led down a dark road with Hyeon and Tae-joo  as they commit terrible deeds with nothing positive ever to come from their unholy union. Innocent people die because of Hyeon's love(..what once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the end)for Tae-joo  and it will cease to end if he doesn't make a painful choice. We see inside their heads  their souls  and it isn't always pretty. 2 hours with them can be quite exhausting..but  credit to the director for pulling no punches in regards to devious behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people. Hyeon  seen as a rather pleasant soul at the opening  accepts hell for Tae-joo so one could look at Thirst as a unique love story  but not exactly a healthy one.<br /><br />In regards to the violence  while Park does have a tendency to pull away from extremely graphic details  there's enough sadism involved to perhaps turn the stomach a bit. At the very least  the way the violence is carried out may be certain to leave a lasting impact. The sexual situations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be pretty heated and erotic  while also sordid and morally reprehensible. The movie  I think  is still quite a complex examination of the lengths one will go to remain attached to an object of affection(lust).,positive
The Priest  into profound love and suffering showed not the result of love  but the process of love and salvation has high-souled beauty of human(or vampire?). http://plaza.rakuten.co.jp/confuoco/diary/200911290000/<br /><br />And the love of Femme fatale is not notorious  but lovely in taking the responsible death as a vampire. She did not keep falling deep into the paradise lost  but decided to leave human alone. Fragile  but lovely Femme fatale! This movie made me think about suffering between human and vampire  that far beyond priest  and salvation. Also I thought about love. Adam was not so responsible for Eve's but this Adam(priest)  sacrificial and responsible to pick Eve up from the Paradise Lost  vampire's world. Another Symphonic Poem of Adam & Eve  Paradise Lost.,positive
There's this whole theory of horror that some people adhere closely to that the monsters and the violence should be kept off-screen. Park Chan-Wook throws that concept completely out the window and shows directly what he wants--and what he wants to show is pretty much anything he can think of. Leaving it to the actors and dialog to create subtlety  from a stylistic perspective Park seems willing to do just about anything to get his point across. Whether it's long involved ensemble scenes with the camera whizzing around a mah-jong table or entire weeks confined to a single shot between two other scenes  dialog from the scenes before and after bleeding over them  Park doesn't keep to a specifically structured style but focuses more on telling the entire story of a couple's relationship from virginal remove through utter codependence to utter self-annihilation--and uses vampirism as the link and priestliness as the drama. It's that simple  and that complex  at the same time.<br /><br />You gotta give him credit. Too many people are ready to compare any modern vampire movie to Twilight  with Twilight almost always being the lesser of the works  but here the stories are actually comparable  but this one is more raw and honest. None of this sparkly coming in the window during the night to talk crap  but anything ranging from the dirtiest  most desperate and virginal sex scene to eventual spousal abuse as the two leads begin to vie for power over one another. It's the same deal--guy and girl meet  girl finds out guy is a vampire  decides to join him anyway  but with no happily ever after  just straight-up limited time as they become forced to keep each other closer and closer and run out of options. The girl's motivations are particularly interesting as one desperately craving power and attention  to a fault  foiled by the guy who just wants to live a good life as best he can under the circumstances  but is a hypocrite who cannot admit that he's merely using his vampirism as an excuse to act against his moral training.<br /><br />The movie isn't perfect and it does tend to stretch (there's no three act  five act  or any act structure here  just scene after scene of character building and dysfunctional romance)  but what's great about it is that Park Chan-Wook is willing to show everything frankly and honestly while delighting the horror sensibilities of tension and gore. He also provides an expertly chosen soundtrack to hit the emotional high-notes in a pretty effective way  too.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB,positive
A beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experiment which fails and turns him into a vampire. <br /><br />Physical and psychological changes lead to his affair with a wife of his childhood friend who is repressed and tired of her mundane life. <br /><br />The one-time priest falls deeper in despair and depravity. As things turns for worse  he struggles to maintain whats left of his humanity...<br /><br />The vampire movie should have really been extinct now thanks to the poor efforts of the Twilight and Underworld franchises  but the director injects new blood into the story of the vampire  by putting simple things into perspective.<br /><br />These vampires have reflections  and no fangs  but still feed and die the same. Making the main protagonist a priest really opens up a can of worms for questioning ones acts. The priest primarily feeds to make himself better  but when he meets his friends unfulfilled wife  carnal instincts set in.<br /><br />What makes this film intensely erotic is that when the couple consent for the first time  they are experiencing something they have never before  forbidden passion  which makes the scenario all that more sensual.<br /><br />Chan-Wook adds some much needed humour into the film  but this is only realised in the final third of the movie. We see the daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone  and when she realises her own strength  just puts the chair down and carry on. Hilarious.<br /><br />and the final act wouldn't be out of place in a carry on film  or even the three Stooges as the couple fight for survival/death respectively.<br /><br />CGI is subtle and fantastic  and the scenes with them jumping from building to building is so graceful  you could be watching ballet.<br /><br />The vampire genre feels fresh and vibrant after this  but more importantly  has the eroticism and intensity that most vampire films are missing these days. It's violent  but from the director in question  i wouldn't expect anything different.<br /><br />A really interesting story  with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography.,positive
Of the Korean movies I've seen  only three had really stuck with me. The first is the excellent horror A Tale of Two Sisters. The second and third - and now fourth too - have all been Park Chan Wook's movies  namely Oldboy  Sympathy for Lady Vengeance)  and now Thirst. <br /><br />Park kinda reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with his irreverence towards convention. All his movies are shocking  but not in a gratuitous sense. It's more like he shows us what we don't expect to see - typically situations that go radically against society's morals  like incest or a libidinous  blood-sucking  yet devout priest. He's also quite artistically-inclined with regards to cinematography  and his movies are among the more gorgeous that I've seen.<br /><br />Thirst is all that - being about said priest and the repressed  conscience-less woman he falls for - and more. It's horror  drama  and even comedy  as Park disarms his audience with many inappropriate yet humorous situations. As such  this might be his best work for me yet  since his other two movies that I've seen were lacking the humor element that would've made them more palatable for repeat viewings.,positive
'Oldboy' director Park Chun-wook returns with what must be one of the yuckiest and at the same time most serious vampire flicks in movie history.<br /><br />Trusting the latest Hollywood fad  vampires these days are supposed to be rather nonviolent  asexual  love-lorn chevaliers instead of the evil rampantly sexual blood-sucking mind-manipulating man-beasts of yore. This is the film you want to see if you want to remember the sticky thrills of the past... well  at least in the second half.<br /><br />'Thirst' starts out with a lengthy character exposition culminating in a slightly different love story. The vampire transformation of a priest is  over quite some time  sidelined by the romantic and sexual aspects of the story  which makes for some awkward viewing. But the last 40 minutes or so are surprisingly gory. Well  maybe not so surprisingly if you know 'Oldboy' and 'I'm a Cyborg but that's OK'  but I guess it's fair to say that 'Thirst' beats Park's earlier films in terms of in-your-face violence. <br /><br />All in all  be warned that this is neither art cinema nor a horror flick. It may be too disgusting for many and too tame for some. 'Thirst' is original  entertaining and fortunately a little less weird than Park Chun-wook's earlier endeavors.,positive
I attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both have delivered less than memorable performances & films. While the underlying general storyline is somewhat familiar  this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other. The human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both; the scene when Costner confronts Kutcher with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most unforgettable emotional moment. The specific storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite Coast Guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job & responsibility...to save lives at sea. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and wowing...I haven't seen such angry seas since The Perfect Storm. Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's Carnivale - great to see him again) played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak  Alaska base in a strong  convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins. The film wonderfully  and finally  gives long overdue exposure and respect to the Coast Guard; it had the audience applauding at the end.,positive
Chan-wook Park  you have to hand it to the guy. In my eyes  he's not only a brilliant director but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often provides something refreshing yet still ultimately satisfying.<br /><br />Thirst is  essentially  a vampire tale but one that plays fast and loose with some of the rules of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon  a man who unselfishly gives himself over to a research program and then unselfishly kind of catches the disease they are trying to cure  dies and comes back. All thanks to the blood he was transfused with. Being the only one out of five hundred to survive  he becomes quite the celebrity to those who know him and all he wants is to get back to normal. Normal  however  now involves being able to leap great distances without injury  wanting to drink blood and getting severely hot under the collar when rays of sun get on his skin. It's not long before he's living with a rather dysfunctional family unit who knew him in his childhood and while he hides his new  strange lifestyle he finds himself drawn into a complex love triangle  becoming more acceptable of darker thoughts and sliding down a slippery slope that could lead him from man to beast to monster.<br /><br />Deftly blending a number of genres  Park's movie felt much fresher and more original to me than Let The Right One In (to use a recent example) and genuinely impressed me with it's approach to material that could easily have felt as well-worn and rehashed as any number of other vampire movies we've seen over the years. It's a mixture of horror  melodrama and comedy while also pondering ideas such as strength of faith  the power over life and death  the downside of immortality  etc  etc.<br /><br />Some people have complained that this genre-blending approach weakens the movie but I personally found that it was a lively  entertaining and always enjoyable movie helped by a great central performance from Song as the tortured priest and fantastic turns from a supporting cast with no weak links. Many characters get to move through a range of emotions and all do so with skill and believability  especially the young woman (played by OK-vin Kim) who becomes the object of the priest's love  lust and affection.<br /><br />Fans of Asian cinema (and Park in particular) and also fans of Poe's The Tell-tale Heart (watch and learn) should lap this up  it's yet another classy movie from a man who seems to take everything in his stride and always manages to put out nothing less than solid entertainment.<br /><br />See this if you like: Cronos  Near Dark  Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man.,positive
The great thing about Thirst  Chanwook Park's latest film  is that it's the anti-Twilight. Some of you may take that as a minus  but in reality it's a big plus. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously  and as well the torrid love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both of the characters- Sang-hyeon being a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that  unbeknownst to him  turns him into a sickly but true-blue vampire  and Tae-Joo with her mother and idiot brother  the latter is killed by Sang- as in a very strong melodrama. There's nothing terribly weepy or insipid with the story and characters at any point  and the implications put forth from religion early on (Sang  for example  is seen as a healer of sorts since he rose from the dead thanks to his vampirism  even as he just can't be that and knows it) on top of those about good vs evil  push it up into another plane cinematically.<br /><br />That Thirst also rises up to the awesome standard of artistry that Park has displayed with Oldboy  Lady Vengeance and the underrated I'm a Cyborg but That's OK  should be taken as a given. Thirst is a film with a juicy narrative and bizarre suburban characters  and is shot and edited with an eye for a mood that is part satiric  part romantic/erotic  part dramatic and lastly fantastical. And it doesn't always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set-up (though as a horror movie Park has more than his share of scary scenes). It's more akin to the movie Near Dark which never mentioned the word vampire but let you know it was  and treated it with sincerity and a kind of lucid track of attention  and that the disease itself and its effect on a person's existence is perhaps scarier than the killings or bloodshed. Once you see one vampire jump up really high or heal its wounds  you've seen em' all.<br /><br />Thirst also has a wicked sense of humor  much like Oldboy  only here with a bite (pun intended) meant to emphasize bizarre physical states of being. An example of this can be found with the Priest's predilection of sucking off of blood from people in comas by taking their blood tube and suckling on it on the floor. Or the manner in which Tae-Joo holds on to one scrap of humanity by keeping her mother alive  even as she's had something like a stroke and can only blink her eyes and tap one finger as a means of reacting to the blood-suckers who've brought pain and horror to her home. But these moments are like icing on the cake to make it a complete experience. What makes Thirst last in the mind is how elements come together  of drama and existential pains  of a Bunuelian-surreal sense of Catholicism (I especially loved the dynamic between Sang-hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm up for blood-sucking but really wants to be a vampire too)  and of the erotic: the scenes where the priest finally gives in to Tae-Joo are incredible in their pace and length of shots and how real it gets. Not in a pornographic manner  but in the sense of these characters' release and escape  which doesn't last long over the scope of the story.<br /><br />If it's not as great as Oldboy  it's not something to carp about. Not all films Chanwook Park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece (and  at the least  he'll always be known as the man who directed that movie). But Thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre  and to the serious streak of vampire movies in general. The film-making is crisp and exciting and even dangerous (and what a white room of 'daylight' the characters live in!)  the humor is dark and hilarious  the acting is intense and moody- especially from subtle strokes from Song Kang-ho and the quirky evil and surprising vulnerability from Kim OK-vin  and the ending  when it does finally get there  is one of those truly superb vampire-movie endings you'll be talking about for years  in a good way. In a battle between Thirst and Twilight  Thirst takes the knock-out in the first round. Between Let the Right One In or Near Dark  it's tougher to call. 9.5/10,positive
As others that have commented around the web... I'm a 130 pilot in the Coast Guard. Having said that  and being the skeptic I am  I went expecting the over-the-top cheese factors. There was some cheese  but all in all  not much.. and the film was pretty accurate.<br /><br />I watched the trailer again today. After seeing the film yesterday  I've realized the trailer gives the impression the movie is nothing but rescue after rescue action scenes. This isn't the case.<br /><br />The movie is truly more character/story driven than action. The inner struggles both Costner and Kutcher are dealing with.. Kutcher's is revealed further into than movie than Costner's is.<br /><br />Of course  there is a minor love story.. no surprise there. But for the most part  the movie tells the tale of two lives that come together  and after some time  help each other heal old wounds.<br /><br />As girlie as it sounds  Costner and  as much as I try not to like him  Kutcher do actually work quite well together and compliment each other very well in the movie.<br /><br />As critics have stated  you've seen it all before.. Top Gun  Officer and a Gentlemen  etc. But what movie hasn't been remade a million times.<br /><br />I can recall only one F word being spoken.. and can't really recall any other language.<br /><br />The movie is 2+ hours  and for some  may tend to get a little long towards the end.<br /><br />You'll laugh  you may cry  but I can honestly say  it was worth the $4 I paid.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the movie.,positive
Korean cinema has the ability to turn genres on its head  and the latest by the celebrated director Chan-wook Park is a tale of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire. Add a temptress leading him astray and a cast of eccentrics and you have a wonderful recipe.<br /><br />Directed in part in a style similar to the Sympathy trilogy it's as sumptuous as it is dark. Steering clear of cliché it does offer some new tricks in the overdone vampire genre. Its an existential movie trying to capture the moral conundrum of how exactly a person has to choose to live with their conditions rather than revel in the blood lust. However  the film doesn't take itself too seriously and there is boundless humour throughout.<br /><br />Our leads play their roles to perfection  playing with our emotions and revelling in the dark humour. There are moments of reflection on the whole moral conundrums involved in the film but its never preachy. Some might find it overlong and it can lull at points but it's worth giving it a chance to the end.<br /><br />If you like left field films then there are fewer better than this one of late. Dark and engrossing  it will pull in a crowd. One I'd recommend you give a try.,positive
After watching Oldboy I was a little disappointed by the rest of Park's work  some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that Oldboy had. This one does  it is nothing like Oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is there.<br /><br />The acting is good with Kang-ho Song  OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin delivering excellent performances. Kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep.<br /><br />The plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clichés.<br /><br />The directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen. It does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever see.<br /><br />This is just a great film.,positive
Now that I have seen it  it was NOT what I was expecting  at least not until the very END. I read some of the other reviews before picking up a used copy of this from Amazon and was glad I did. Having been first introduced to Park's work via Oldboy  I was curious to how he'd treat the genre and was rather pleased at the clever manner in which he executed it. I think Park has matured in terms of presentation because while Oldboy and some of his other work has very nice and deliberate camera work  he has some nice innovations in Bakjwi that I had not seen in other vamp movies. For example the scene where Father Hyeon is realizing the beast growing within him as he gives his shoes to the always barefoot Tae-ju and he is able to SEE the blood pumping through Tae-ju's skin and his eye's widen in blood-lust for it. That was a nice effect. I was also happy that Park did not CG the crap out of the movie and the is in fact very little CG at all. I came away from Bakjwi being totally set up to think one thing was going to happen and get taken for a ride in true Park fashion. Additionally  I liked that Park played with a little symbolism and reversal whereas we don't usually get this is Asia cinema. During the beginning of the movie we see the plot develop slowly and get to know the characters and you feel like an invisible observer to the thing that are transpiring. Park treats you a little like Ghost of Christmas future coming to show you  albeit a bit boringly  what life is like outside your world. Ah  but then we start to feel a little kinship with the befallen Father and his burgeoning lust for Tae-ju and conflict with duty as a priest. We almost start to root for them even until Park not so nicely slaps us back into reality and we really see that in the end Bakjwi is a movie about moral dilemma and right and wrong. It won't spoil it if I tell you to watch Bakjwi from the mindset of a priest and I think you'll come away from it with what Park wants you to come away with. Don't expect Oldboy and stylization because that's not what you'll get here. A very interesting take on the genre indeed. Those who missed the MANY literary elements and religious allusions watched some other movie  not Bakjwi. After Bakjwi  watch Let The Right One IN  it's also not what you'll expect either.,positive
No pun intended. I'm not going to spoil anything about the story  but it's safe to assume that you already know  what kind of character the main actor portrays. And of course being a priest while being naughty exaggerates all that. Plus this is the most erotic movie from Park Chan Wook yet.<br /><br />If you have seen Wook's previous works/movies you know he is very visual (in a good way) and it shows again here. While it strays away from the vengeance theme of his prior movies on the surface  it still has quite some heat hidden underneath. And when that boils  quite a few bad things start to happen. But through all that dark  there also moments of light (fun) to be had too. A very stylistic and though provoking movie  that lives outside the mainstream and does a very good job ...,positive
The vampire craze has  in my opinion  actually proved its worthiness of such infamous categorization. There were many sub-genre films last year from a multitude of countries. I've reviewed many and have a few more to discuss. Forgive my indulgence  but since I've recognized the trend as a phenomenon (which it is and  coincidentally  features my favorite horror staple). I'm going to now move outside of North America for a bit and introduce you to hopefully meaning films that you didn't see as of now.<br /><br />Of the many effects of Twilight is the creation of guy and girl vampire movies. I hate this sexist categorization  which has the effect of polarizing an entire generation of fans into sides. I think men are prone to hate Stephenie Meyer's work (and its offspring) to some degree because they feel some sense of betrayal that an archetype which was always theirs is now liberated. Women may be unlikely to enjoy future neutral pics since they grew up with ironclad expectations that were enforced four times. We need more directors to create vampire films which either gender is capable of enjoying (unequally) if vampires are going to survive the craze and remain relevant. Cue: Thirst This Korean film was directed by Park Chan-Wook of Oldboy fame. There are two ways to dissect it. Either it straddles between gender expectations and is universally marginally enjoyable  or it is a floundering mess that doesn't decide which target audience it prefers and should therefore be viewed by no one. Don't let me convince you that the film has no inclinations. Its director is a man whose fame is story-driven action films. Its protagonist is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on this later). Still  his desire for a woman he has known both before and after mortal life is not contrived  and his attention is returned. There is a male slant to this picture  yet it is not so one-sided that women could not enjoy it. The same cannot be said of Daybreakers or New Moon.<br /><br />The plot follows an Emile Zola novel called Thérèse Raquin  which I have not read. According to Wikipedia  the novel is about an affair that develops between a married woman and a single man. He kills her husband during a fishing trip and begins dating her. The two of them are incapable of having sex because they picture the dead man's body between them. They are thus driven to insanity  but care for the woman's ailing mother. At the novel's conclusion  they try to kill each other  discover each other's plans  and commit suicide.<br /><br />Now  transcribe this nearly 150 year old French novel into modern South Korea and you've got Thirst. Chan-Wook doesn't embellish the story enough to elevate this to must-see. He often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of following his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when his scruples are unhinged by narrative. His use of the mother-in-law as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect. See it.<br /><br />The protagonist is originally a devout Christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine. He thus becomes the god he once was smitten with. People flock to him and view him as a grand healer. OK. That's really cool and could have provided a great basis for his relationship. Yet this idea is given little idea screen time as he changes into a realistic Christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue even though his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it. Instead of confronting the delusional people  he instead sips blood out of comatose hospital patients.<br /><br />Let's continue with the Christian allusion. The woman tricks the vampire man into killing her husband. Her overprotective mother-in-law suffers a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughter-in-law's treachery (finger waggles). The man kills her but resurrects her. The two of them invite former friends over and the woman begins mercilessly harassing the humans. The man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her into waiting for sunrise with him. They both die  but he atones for her crimes (and his own but the film portrays her evil more prominently).<br /><br />The woman character is a caricature  and her profession offers an explanation for her behavior. She is a housewife with no education  while the man is a priest whose mortal life was restrictive. Vampirism magnifies their characteristics. She becomes a monster like one would expect of someone without knowledge. He becomes a demigod with a spirit. His life is how atheists view themselves and her life is how religious people view those without divine intervention.,positive
From the director of Oldboy comes this slick vampire flick. Kang-ho Song stars as a priest who is accidentally changed into a vampire while being cured of a deadly  mysterious virus. His vampirism and priesthood are quite at conflict  but he is able to survive by robbing the hospital's blood bank and unconscious patients who might not mind some siphoned blood. Because of his supposedly miraculous survival  he comes into the lives of Ha-kyun Shin's family. Shin has cancer  and his mother believes that Song can cure it. Unfortunately  Song's vampirism raises his levels of lust to a height where he can't help but fall for Shin's young wife  OK-vin Kim. Kim is intensely interested in the world of vampirism  and the two become lovers. The film from there goes in weird directions that I think one should experience for themselves. What really should be mentioned is Chan-wook Park's mastery of the medium of cinema. My God  I've rarely seen such a masterful visual artist at the peak of his powers. The major flaw of the film is that it's a little incoherent  especially near the beginning. Park is interested in telling his stories mostly in the visuals  which can be difficult to follow at times. But when it works  man  does it fly. The film is also perversely hilarious. The final sequence  easily one of the best of the decade  is simultaneously heartbreaking and delightfully ridiculous. OK-vin Kim should become a worldwide star after this film. She gives one of the best performances of the year.,positive
I won't bore you with any synopsis  chances are you already know them. And hopefully you are already familiar with Park Chan-Wook's work.<br /><br />I STRONGLY disagree with some of the other commentators in saying that Park has not moved on from the vengeance trilogy blah blah blah. Because you know what? He HAS!!! The vengeance trilogy were different from each other in style to begin with  how can you even compare the sombreness and subtlety of Sympathy For Mr Vengeance with the frantic and extravagance of Oldboy? Park Chan-Wook has incredible style  but his movies don't all share the SAME style! That has been true and remains true with the release of Thirst. <br /><br />Thirst is an incredible picture  it literally has EVERYTHING you want in a movie. Jaw-dropping violence  tasteful gore  great humour  incredible suspense and even very realistic sex scenes. The story is so crazy that at no point can you guess what will happen next. I'm so happy to say that Park is back in top form with this fantastic dark-comic-vampire-love-story. Watch it as soon as you can!,positive
Thirst<br /><br />I found that this film was beautifully crafted. The cinematography was well above excellent. I though almost any frame could be frozen  and you would have yourself an exquisite photograph. The use of color stands out most. In many instances the camera was gliding through the scene and the work was flawless.<br /><br />Park Chan Wook's direction was fantastic. He had me believing unwaveringly in his far- fetched universe. There were several touches of verbal and visual humor (of a dark nature) that just added another depth to the picture as a whole.<br /><br />The acting I would not call outstanding but it suited the film and worked well enough.<br /><br />For me  the only place where this film lacked was in the story. At times  I will not lie  the goings on between characters just did not make sense. Sometimes the story flow was clunky. Overall  I was disappointed with the subdued narrative  and I felt it ran a little too long.<br /><br />But I still recommend this film  for its vision  its visual flourish  its dark humor  and at the end of the day  it is an interesting film even if imperfect. 9/10,positive
If you love Chan-wook Park  you know what to expect. His films are brutal  poetic  tragic  and artistic  with splashes of very grim humor. THIRST is clearly Park's style  and I loved every second of it  from the cinematography (every shot is gorgeous and creative) to the story  which blends Shakespearean tragedy  murderous love  Gothic horror  and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy. The direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced - like SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE  there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent  bold  consistently surprising filmmaker. It's unpredictable - scenes go from brutal and heart-wrenching to laugh-out-loud hilarious in an instant. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE then SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE as far as being over-the-top and comical. But  like LADY VENGEANCE  it's incredibly rich  thought-provoking  and rewarding.<br /><br />If you like beautifully told vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or are a fan of Chan-wook Park  seeing THIRST should be obvious. Easily one of the best films of 2009.,positive
Not for the squeamish  but the number of twists  inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology  gorgeous visual extremes  together with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most stunning horror films I've ever seen. It descends into utter madness along with characters  but never seems exploitative or horrific without purpose. There are copious amounts of bloodletting accompanied by some nasty sucking and squishing sounds  but also subtle moments where you laugh out loud. As he tends to do  Chan-wook Park keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters. <br /><br />And there's a lot of literal leaping. Keeping in the vein of vampire myth (pun intended)  they have superhuman strength and can nearly leap tall buildings in a single bound (to coin a phrase). The first time our heroine is carried by the across the tops of buildings by the troubled vampire priest  it has all the magical romance of Lois Lane and Superman - but this romance becomes increasingly disturbing - but driven by a strange and conflicted 'love affair' not by mere horror.<br /><br />The acting is superb  particularly OK-vin Kim  the gorgeous actress in the female lead role who  at 22  shows a range that is remarkable. The character borders on a kind of black widow film noir type. She careens from innocent to impish to vixen to demon with utter conviction. This is a really smooth and nervy performance. <br /><br />If you love real art in horror  or are a fan of Oldboy - don't wait for the video  see it immediately.,positive
I know little or nothing about astronomy  but nevertheless; I was  at first  a little sceptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion  and thus (naturally) become ruthless serial killers. The plot does sound ridiculous at first  but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out Saturn and  as you know  Saturn is the emotion planet  it all falls into place; makes complete sense and it's then that you know you aren't simply watching another silly 80's slasher with a pea brain plot. Thank god for that! Seriously  though  Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous premise  but it more than makes up for that with it's originality. Having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema  but when given the choice between this and another dull Friday the 13th clone - I know what I'd choose.<br /><br />Also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it's silly plot dug it into is the fact that it's extremely entertaining. Many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore. This film  however  keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids (which harks back to creepy kid classics such as Village of the Damned)  a constant stream of sick humour and a small  but impressive for the type of film  dose of suspense and tension. One thing that I liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry. There's nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again (cough Halloween cough)  but that's not the case here as Bloody Birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows. There wasn't any room for a chainsaw  which is a huge shame  but I suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it.,positive
Three children are born at the exact same time during a lunar eclipse.Just before their 10th birthday they embark on a killing spree.Bloody Birthday is a typical slasher from early 80's.It's a pretty average stuff with plenty of nudity.The evil children never generate any menace and there is almost no suspense.There is also no gore or scares in Bloody Birthday but the film is mildly entertaining.Unfortunately no real explanation is provided for the kids sudden homicidal mania.The murder scenes are quite gruesome for example we've got death by handgun baseball bat skipping rope and shovel.So if you're a fan of early 80's slasher movies give this one a look.,positive
I thought I was going to watch another Friday The 13th or a Halloween rip off  But I was surprised  It's about 3 psycho kids who kill  There's not too many movies like that  I can think of Mikey  Children Of The Corn and a few others  It's not the greatest horror movie but it's a least worth a rent.,positive
Three kids are born during a solar eclipse and turn into vile murderous little tykes who're above suspicion by everyone  save for Joyce (Lori Lethin) and her younger brother Timmy. That's the story in a nutshell. The acting in this one is tolerable for the most part. Notable for MTV-J Julie Brown (not the 'Downtown' one) showing some skin  and a very early part (albiet small) for Michael Dudikoff. Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination  but in the 'killer kids' sub-genre it's a bit of a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Julie Brown shows T&A (the only film thus far  to claim that honor); Sylvia Wright gets topless <br /><br />DVD Extras (R1): 16 minute interview with Producer Max Rosenberg (wherein he insults the director AND Canada  great stuff); Biography of Ed Hunt; and trailers for Kiss of the Taratula  Don't open the Door  & a red-band one for Homework (which features nudity) <br /><br />My Grade: B-,positive
Three children are born during a solar eclipse and ten years later this has somehow caused them to grow up without consciences. As their simultaneous tenth birthday celebrations approach  they become cunning and calculating cold-blooded murderers. Nice-girl local teen Joyce Russel (Lori Lethin) finds herself confronting these little terrors when most others are falling for their angelic demeanors.<br /><br />Hearkening back to films like The Bad Seed and Village of the Damned  this films' premise of evil children may not be wholly original but it's still pretty disturbing. All three of the child actors - Elizabeth Hoy  Billy Jacoby  and Andy Freeman - are chillingly convincing. Director Ed Hunt and his co-writer Barry Pearson maintain the unpleasant yet compelling mood for the duration of the film; they go so far as to have the little girl charge admission for an unwilling peep show involving her older sister (future stand-up comedienne and MTV personality Julie Brown  whose striptease is a real eyeful).<br /><br />Name actors Susan Strasberg  as an icy teacher  and Jose Ferrer  with barely any screen time as a doctor  add to the proceedings with their presence  while K.C. Martel  one of the youngsters from the original The Amityville Horror  is very likable as Joyces' kid brother. Other familiar faces like Ellen Geer  B-movie he-man Michael Dudikoff  Cyril O'Reilly (Porky's  Dance of the Damned)  Joe Penny ('Jake and the Fatman')  and William Boyett (The Hidden) can be seen as well.<br /><br />Touching upon such parental fears as children playing with guns that they've discovered and being locked inside old refrigerators  Bloody Birthday is a little more than just a slasher variation with kids as antagonists. Aided and abetted by Arlon Obers' music score  this film sticks in the memory more than some of its brethren  without lots of gore to fall back on (although that arrow through the eye gag works quite well).<br /><br />Bleak  nasty  and downbeat  Bloody Birthday is worth a look for the curious.<br /><br />7/10,positive
Story about three eclipse (maybe even Indigo  ha) children beginning their love for murder. Oh  and the people who are hot on their trail.<br /><br />Bloody Birthday  a pretty mediocre title for the film  was a nice lil surprise. I was in no way expecting a film that dealt with blood-thirsty psychopath kids. And I may say it's also one of the best flicks I've seen with kids as the villains. By the end of the movie I seriously wanted these kids to die in horrible fashion.<br /><br />It's a really solid 80s horror flick  but how these kids are getting away with all this mayhem and murder is just something that you can't not think about. Even the slightest bit of investigation would easily uncover these lil sh!ts as the murderers. But there seems to be only a couple police in town  well by the end  only one  and he seemed like a dimwit  so I suppose they could have gotten away with it. Haha  yeah  and I'm a Chinese jet-pilot.<br /><br />Nevertheless  this movie delivered some evilass kids who were more than entertaining  a lot of premarital sex and a decent amount of boobage. No kiddin! If you're put off by the less than stellar title  dash it from your mind and give this flick a shot. It's a very recommendable and underrated 80s horror flick.,positive
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters. Steven (Andy Freeman)  Curtis (Billy Jayne;credited as Billy Jacoby)  and Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy)  were all born on the same day during an eclipse. Besides sharing a birthday  they also share a love of murder (and they're not picky about who they kill either). Young Billy  Elizabeth  and Andy play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too. But they can't go on fooling everyone. This is an overall good horror flick  its not too unrealistic  there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well  (the grown-ups are pretty hammy though). I'd say its well worth seeing  (I own a copy myself).,positive
"This agreeably perverse and oddball early 80's teen body count flick may never reach the astonishingly bent pinnacle of the deeply unsettling and criminally underrated murderous moppets movie Devil Times Five, but it's still an above average killer kid opus nonetheless.<br /><br />The slim  but serviceable plot centers on a trio of misfit tykes -- two bratty boys and one creepily twinkle-eyed  albeit angelic-looking little girl -- who are all born during a solar eclipse on June 9th  1970. When the strange antisocial trio  who stick together in a tightly self-contained and exclusive circle  reach ten years of age they suddenly go homicidally bonkers and declare open season on the hapless  unsuspecting local yokels of the heretofore sleepy and peaceful California suburb of Meadowvale. Writer/director Ed Hunt  the usually incompetent unsung hack responsible for such wonderfully wretched clunkers as the delightfully dopey Starship Invasions, the uproariously inane Jesus Christ vigilante parable (!) Alien Warrior, and the stunningly silly The Brain, does a pretty solid and capable job here: the kill scenes are abundant and reasonably brutal (the arrow-through-the-eye gag is especially nasty)  there's a sizable smattering of gratuitous nudity and soft-core sex  a goodly amount of tension is neatly created and maintained  some nice dollops of dark humor punctuate the arrestingly warped mayhem  and the surprise grim ending manages to be truly jolting.<br /><br />Moreover  the top-drawer cast further elevates the proceedings to the perfectly watchable and absorbing: Jose Ferror as a small-town doctor  future Jake and the Fatman TV series star Joe Penny as an amateur astrologer  The Prey 's Lori Lethin as the plucky babysitter heroine  Susan Strasberg as a bitchy school teacher  American Ninja 's Michael Dudikoff as a chowderhead jock  and Cyril O'Reilly (the lonely misanthrope vampire in the hauntingly melancholy Dance of the Damned) as a libidinous teen dude who gets bagged while doing just what you think with some naked hot chick in back of a parked van. Billy Jacoby (who went on to star in such late 80's direct-to-video dross as Dr. Alien and Demonwarp)  Andy Freeman  and especially the eerily adorable Elizabeth Hoy are genuinely creepy and convincing as the terrible troika of chillingly evil and amoral rugrats. And  yes  that's none other than Julie Brown  the brassy comedienne who scored a surprise Top 40 hit with the hilarious novelty tune The Homecoming Queen's Gotta Gun, as the lovely  vacuous  full-breasted redhead bimbo who does a great lengthy  totally extraneous  yet still sizzling and much-appreciated nude striptease while dancing in her bedroom to a cheesy blaring rock song! All in all  this baby sizes up as a sturdy and satisfying slasher item.",positive
I went to an advance screening of this movie thinking I was about to embark on 120 minutes of cheezy lines  mindless plot  and the kind of nauseous acting that made The Postman one of the most malignant displays of cinematic blundering of our time. But I was shocked. Shocked to find a film starring Costner that appealed to the soul of the audience. Shocked that Ashton Kutcher could act in such a serious role. Shocked that a film starring both actually engaged and captured my own emotions. Not since 'Robin Hood' have I seen this Costner: full of depth and complex emotion. Kutcher seems to have tweaked the serious acting he played with in Butterfly Effect. These two actors came into this film with a serious  focused attitude that shone through in what I thought was one of the best films I've seen this year. No  its not an Oscar worthy movie. It's not an epic  or a profound social commentary film. Rather  its a story about a simple topic  illuminated in a way that brings that audience to a higher level of empathy than thought possible. That's what I think good film-making is and I for one am throughly impressed by this work. Bravo!,positive
This movie is great. 80's sleazy slasher movie about three kids born during an eclipse  so they kill everyone they see. The reason they kill makes practically no sense  but it just adds to the charm of this movie. And dang  these kids are crazy  especially Curtis. If you've seen the movie  you know who I am talking about. That kid's vicous! Although the movie doesn't have much gore  it is entertaining  and for some reason you kind of care about the characters. It also has some nice nudity. Has some decent acting as well  really a decent 80's slasher movie  it's worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it. You'll have nightmares about those darn kids though  I guarantee you!,positive
Sorry about the extremely clever summary phrase. I don't know what I was thinking  but I really couldn't help myself.<br /><br />I've been meaning to see 'Bloody Birthday' for a long time and I must say that it was a pleasant surprise to find a copy of this film by accident and for such a low price. And believe me  I live in a small South American village and these things are very unlikely to happen. It's a real shame that some of these 'gems' from the 80s are now almost completely forgotten. 'Bloody Birthday' is one of those movies that surprisingly ages well enough to remain watchable nowadays. Not a masterpiece for sure  but still entertaining and guess what?... it doesn't really have unintentionally funny scenes. I know it's a shocker if we keep in mind that this is a low budget flick from the early 80s about a group of evil children who kill people. But trust me  the movie manages to remain respectable and watchable for the most part.<br /><br />In 'Blood Birthday'  the story revolves around three children who are born during a a total eclipse. According to astrology  during eclipses  the sun and the moon block Saturn  which controls emotions. As a consequence  the three children who are born that day  eventually become uncaring and evil. Since they don't experience any feelings of remorse whatsoever  these 10-year-old kids gang up against basically everyone who stands in their way  including their own parents and siblings... and kill them! The body count increases day after day and the police authorities believe that there's a psychopath lurking around the place. In the meantime  Debbie  Curtis and Steven  don't hesitate to keep butchering people  since nobody seems to suspect of those sweet angel faces (?)<br /><br />Like I was saying before  'Bloody Birthday' is surprisingly NOT funny. I know I said that before  but I'm truly surprised by this. I was expecting some hilariously bad scenes  but the movie proved me wrong. True  it's not exactly what most people would consider a 'serious' horror movie  but if I have to be fair  I'd say that the story is decently executed. One of the most important reasons why one would normally expect laughable situations (like I did)  it's because in these kind of movies in which the main villains are children  the young actors tend to be plain awful and they make the whole thing laughable. Let's face it: kids tend to be horrible actors  which is understandable and we can't blame them for that. But to my surprise  the three young actors who played the merciless killers in this film  looked very disturbing and not at all funny. The rest of the actors are also good and if you're a George Clooney fan  you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie. Yeah  I know right?... who cares?. Also  Julie Brown  the great actress  singer  comedienne and gay icon  gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and in case anyone is interested in nudity: she also strips in one of the scenes and she looks great naked. Too bad she didn't have more time on the screen though! Julie is 'absolutely fabulous':P<br /><br />So basically  this movie is fine if you're in the mood for some modest horror from the 80s. My only objection regarding 'Bloody Birthday' would be the way to justify the children's motives. This is perhaps one of the lowest points of the film. Let's see: if children who were born during an eclipse end up being heartless killers  then how come these three were the only ones who actually murdered people? I'm sure there were other children who had been born the same day... and during other days of total eclipse too  oh well!. Overall  no big deal  it's just a simple observation  that's all. I've seen worse  trust me. Take 'The Children' (1980) for example  in which the precocious killer get their evilness after being turned into zombies by toxic cloud. No  believe me  'Bloody Birthday' is far more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers  you're going to enjoy this one very much.<br /><br />So  now you know: you're invited to the children's birthday party... and the hosts will be serving a delicious poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests. Come on  you can't miss it ;),positive
Three ten-year-old children born at the same time during a solar eclipse begin to slyly murder anybody that offends them.<br /><br />While killer kid movies weren't exactly new at the time of this twisted 80's slasher the theme of children as murderers works nicely for this film. Bloody Birthday does deliver some good chills and suspense  while managing to be a competent killer thriller with some strange qualities. It straddles a fine line between cheesy and creepy  but it does remain entertaining throughout with an interesting plot. There's some strong murder scenes  as well as a good bit of nudity to establish this as a solid slasher guilty pleasure.<br /><br />The cast does a fairly good job. Young stars Elizabeth Hoy and K.C. Martel deliver some menacing performances  while rising star Julie Brown does a striptease before a memorable murder scene. Veteran star Susan Strasberg does well as the teacher and Jose Ferrer has a cameo appearance.<br /><br />All around this off-beat slasher entry isn't bad  though it's admittedly not flawless  but it is well worth watching for genre fans.<br /><br />*** out of ****,positive
This movie is not the scariest of all time  but it is a great example of a campy eighties horror flick -- low budget  no stars  lots of inventive death scenes  and enough nudity to keep the teenagers in their seats. The premise is interesting and fun and the three evil kids play their parts well. A nice starting point for Just Say Julie Brown exposing her talents early in her career. This film won't be seen by many  but for fans of 80's horror it's a must.,positive
An absolute classic of 80's scare flix. This one isn't like any other as it pits pint-size  wild-eyed  psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown-ups in town. Bud from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS (80's gold again) plays one of the killer-kids and he's paired up with one of the little girls Jake Blues tries to purchase in the BLUES BROTHERS. There is a third blond boy  but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason. The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots. The demonic gang of smiling kids  though somehow possessed by extra-planetary means  bear little resemblance to the droid-ish Children of the Damned  who never thought to use pistols  crossbows and shovels to kill those pesky adults. Julie Brown (not Downtown Julie Brown-the other one) shows her rack  like three times  as she dances around in her bedroom. This movie is a rarity that I cannot believe I missed growing up in the 80's. This would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if I had seen it. Where is the sequel the ending begs for? This movie is just incredible. Seek it out at all costs.,positive
I can't believe I rarely ever see this title mentioned by all you eighties horror freaks and I definitely won't be joining all my fellow reviewers here in saying that 'Bloody Birthday' is awful viewing. On the contrary  I enjoyed it very much and I was pleasantly surprised by the ingeniousness and surprise twists it offers. Don't just refer to this film as being 'another 80's slasher' because the victims here are rather unlikely and so are the killers. We're introduced to three cherubic-looking youngsters who were all born during a solar eclipse. At the moment they were delivered  planet Saturn was blocked by both the sun and the moon and  due to this  the kids are emotionless and seemly without conscience. This really starts to show around their tenth birthday as they go on a merciless killing spree.<br /><br />Granted  this stuff is incredibility far-fetched and even slightly offensive but  seriously  who cares? Unlike many other horror films from this period  it at least attempts to bring something original and imaginative. For once  the kids' acting is good and the entire film has a creepy atmosphere and grizzly music. The murders sequences are grim and tense  and it's always eerie to see them getting committed by angel-faced kids. I don't know who hired the 3 kids but they did a good job. Especially the girl and the kid with glasses are highly memorable. The bleak images of the heartless trio remind you of classic highlights  such as 'Village of the Damned'  'The Bad Seed' and 'Children of the Damned'. This film is nowhere near as memorable as these milestones but great fun and not one horror lover will regret watching this. <br /><br />Bloody Birthday was written and directed by Ed Hunt. Not particularly the greatest genius in cinema  but a pleasantly deranged fella who also brought us immensely entertaining cheesefests like 'The Brain' and 'Starship Invasions'. If all this isn't enough to convince you yet  Bloody Birthday has a lot of nudity. And not just any nudity  but a topless dance-act by MTV-VJ Julie Brown. Oh  and keep your eyes open for a completely redundant cameo by Joe Penny  later the star of TV-series 'Jake and the Fatman'. Check it out!!,positive
Interesting cartoon  included on the DVD of The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra. I especially like the way the color was used in the background art--very artistic for Columbia  whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results looked like it!)<br /><br />I do wonder  however  how a certain... um  finger gesture... ever got past the censors. Granted  the gesture in question was seen a lot less frequently in 1937 than it is today. You'd think someone besides the animators would have noticed  though--especially since it's seen three times in the scene in question! And based on the context  I suspect that its inclusion was intentional  something the animators slipped in just to see if the censors WOULD notice!,positive
Having just seen Walt Disney's The Skeleton Dance on the Saturday Morning Blog as linked from YouTube  I used those same sources to watch a remake done in Technicolor for the Columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man-Ub Iwerks. The colors  compared to the earlier black and white  are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags-like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one's off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone-are just as funny as the previous short. It does get a little repetitious near the end. Still  Skeleton Frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier Silly Symphony.,positive
First time I saw this great movie and Alyssa  my star*  playing Frances Ella Fitz  was so great in this movie! It was just so real and her little dog so cute! I saw it the first time when I was like 11 years old and it was the best movie i had ever seen  and you know what? I still think so! 10/10 ********** = greatest ever!,positive
Brilliant and moving performances by Tom Courtenay and Peter Finch.,positive
Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great tv film for all ages. The movie focuses around Fizzy (Alyssa Milano) who wants to go on travel for gold in Alaska. The only person who hires her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next for her is an adventure she will never forget. This tv film was just great. The acting is #1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned some information about the Goldrush. I recommend this TV film to all without hesitation. It is also based on a true story.<br /><br />10/10,positive
Here is a movie of adventure  determination  heroism  & bravery. Plus  it's set back in the late 1800s which makes it even more interesting. It's a wonderful  adventurous storyline  and Alyssa Milano is wonderful at playing the wholesome  confident  no-nonsense Fizzy...a great role-model. This is one of my favorite movies. It is a movie to be watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. Not only is the storyline excellent  but the movie also has fabulous scenery and music and is wonderfully directed. This movie is as good as gold!,positive
While Boris(Aleksey Batalov)is off to fight in war against the Germans for his Mother Russia  his beloved Veronika(Tatyana Samojlova)marries his conniving cousin Mark(Aleksandr Shvorin)in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over Moscow. Through various trials and betrayals  Veronika will await word or letter from Boris no matter how long it takes  holding hope that he will return to her.<br /><br />Powerful piece of film-making boasts simply incredible photographic work by cinematographer Sergei Urusevsky. Some of the many magnificently framed  moving shots include the scene where the camera follows Veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to Boris..and doesn't quite reach him even as we watch Boris looking impatiently into the swarm without luck. The sequence after the air raid where Veronika walks up the standing stairs circulating up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where Mark makes his lustful move on Veronika as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind rustles the curtains and flashes of light emanate inside are just two of MANY examples where Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius at framing images that will last forever on film. But  without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who dearly  deeply love each other  this film couldn't hold up with the beauty of the visual alone. Together  however  we're left with an amazing film..simply a haunting masterpiece from the Soviet Union after Stalin breathed his last breath. I feel honored just have beheld such a great film.,positive
In my review just submitted I referred to the young actress lead as Katerina when it should have been Veronika. I was so involved with character and the action I guess that I wasn't that concerned with names. Anyway  she and the film are brilliant. As I said  the cinematography and the director's use of montage are worthy of Eisenstein and his cameraman  Tisse'. The production design is top notch. The placement of actors in the foreground  middle ground and background within any given mise en scene is worthy of study. Stunning  memorable camera movement  and an ending that has an emotional punch that leaves Hollywood films far behind. Gee! Heroic self sacrifice instead of walking into the rainbow. Thanks again  John Hart,positive
"This film is undoubtedly one of the greatest landmarks in history of cinema. By seeing this film we can only retrospectively notice that world cinema in 1950s had such a purely humanistic dramaturgy such a strong and adequate use of sound-image montage and almost religious admiration of ethical choices in human life. Cinema was then not only one form of arts. It was much higher than ordinary life and it gave many people hope to live after the tragic war. It is said  that even Picasso was moved and cried that such a work of art can appear only once in 100 years! Audience that time was also different. I read that after seeing Kurosawa's Ikiru(Live) in its first release  young couple quietly told each other It is a good film, isn't it?. I think contemporary cinema  though technically developed and opened some new narrative perspective  has lost the most important---reliance of audience.Cienma was once really the most popular art from and  unlike modern fine arts and contemporary music gave millions of people hope and ideals. In this point of view Letyat zhuravli must be in the pantheon of classics of all the time  as City light Ikiru and La Strada.",positive
I watched this movie on TCM last night  all excited expectation  having last seen it (twice) in its memorable 1957 release in Toronto. I told my wife  who hadn't seen it before  to watch for the thrilling long tracking shot  no cuts  where Veronika is seen on a bus on her way to find her Boris. In a hand-held frame that certainly predates the modern Steadicam  the shot then pulls back up and cranes (pun unintended) over the street as she exits the bus  and darts among the tanks to cross the road. THEN I remember that  no cuts  we follow her up close to the fence as she peers through  anxiously looking for him  but does not find him. But we do continue to follow Veronika as she searches the faces of harried recruits and their emotionally racked women  all extras  and each one a gem of riveting Stanislavskian behavior. How  one wonders  did Kalatozov and his cameraman Urusevsky set up this extraordinary sequence. But what did I see in this version? After crossing the street dodging the tanks  the scene abruptly ended  and cut back to scenes at the apartment  before continuing to the soldiers and their families at the fence. Seems to me that this film was not only restored  but also re-edited. What a downer!,positive
If you believe that any given war movie can make you really feel the war  you need to see Letyat zhuravli (called The Cranes are Flying in English). It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov)  who are in love on the verge of WWII. They are walking along the waterfront  watching the cranes fly by  when the war starts. Boris is promptly sent off to war. Veronika hides out with a family and ends up marrying the son  whom she does not love. Boris  meanwhile  continues trotting through the countryside  fighting the Nazis and experiencing all the horrors of war  until he he runs out of energy. When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news  she refuses to accept it  until Boris' body arrives home on one of the trains. Simultaneously  the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and the Allied Powers have won the war; the Soviet Union lost 27 million citizens  but it's the start of a new era.<br /><br />This movie did a very good job showing the human impact of the war not only in the battlefield  but also how it affected the civilian population. This is definitely a movie that everyone should see.,positive
This is a magnificent  and in many ways impressive film. I saw it on TV as a little boy  with my throat almost strangled with tears  and again today on the magnificently restored Criterion DVD.<br /><br />Cranes is the very essence of the War Weepie. Imagine Umbrellas of Cherbourg with no music and no color  or Waterloo Bridge with no class consciousness.<br /><br />Tatiana Samoilova  a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork  is deeply affecting as a pretty girl whose fiancé enlists and doesn't write or come back.<br /><br />The fiancé  Boris  dies on the front  and his death scene is indescribably romantic. Very daring too  because so close to over the top. But that scene will stay with you.<br /><br />Although the Soviets were so defined by WWII  the movie is quite unspecific  and more powerful for it. The pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feel. There is no attempt at period detail. The whole film becomes more and more stylized  until the Siberian scenes  which feel like a modern opera set (that is a compliment). The cathartic final scene is milked to its last drop - there again  comparable to Cherbourg. The production feels like a big budget (those staircase scenes must have cost a pretty kopek).<br /><br />Go for it. Don't expect a bitter socialist pill (although it is  of course  very sad). The Cranes are Flying is an impressive slice of world cinema  quite advanced considering where and when it was made.,positive
I'm out of words to describe the beauty of The Cranes are Flying  but I'll try anyway to write about it. It's a powerful and delicate love story that takes its place in the Second World War. It's the classic story of lovers (Boris & Veronika) separated by the war and of what comes between them. The film's images are so gorgeous  that you'll be carried away - the film technique is in perfect unison with the emotion.<br /><br />There are few scenes that portray directly the war: A bombing - wind  lightnings  explosions - that will have important consequences in the life of the main protagonist  Veronika  who waits for the return of Boris; and there's another scene on the front  where we we will be confronted by a emotional/visual hurricane showing the images played in Boris' mind. Another scene works as the leitmotif of the film and provides its title - the cranes flying in the sky. This image stands as a the symbol for Nature and its seasons and underlines the final message of the film: Not to give up hope and fight for a better future.<br /><br />Kalatozov is a great director  this film is visually stunning and it also touched me deeply. It is not just pure technique. <br /><br />Tatyana Samojlova is perfect as Veronika. What more can I say? The film transcends the time it was made - the action takes place during the Second World War. But it could have happened anytime  anywhere. As long there are wars (great or small) the film and its message will remain relevant.,positive
Sick of the current cinema output  particularly American cinema  I've been making an effort to see the Oscar-winning foreign films. That's when I came across this gem. Slow to start  it picks up nicely once war is declared. Basically an old fashioned girl-waits-for-boy-to-return-from-war-story  the performances  the cinematography make this so very much more. Why Tatyana Samojlova as the young woman didn't become an international star after this is beyond me(though she has remained successful in her own country). You take the journey with her: young  defiant impetuous young girl  who  through the ravages of war becomes a very sober  somber woman who keeps a glimmer of hope (her final scene is devastating). We love her as much as the camera does. And the camera-work! Was this the pioneer in hand-held camera work? It truly adds an immediacy to the story. And the beauty of it (like when Tatyana's character is running up stairs and next to a slatted fence). I am humbled and grateful to see this film.,positive
The Dresser is perhaps the most refined of backstage films. The film is brimming with wit and spirit  for the most part provided by the energetic character of Norman (Tom Courtenay). Although his character is clearly gay  and certainly has an attraction for the lead performer (Albert Finney) that he assists  the film never dwells on it or makes it more than it is.<br /><br />The gritty style of Peter Yates that worked so well in Bullitt is again on display  and gives the film a sense of realism and coherence. This is much appreciated in a story that could so easily have become tedious. In the end  The Dresser will bore many people silly  but it will truly be a delight to those who love British cinema.<br /><br />7.7 out of 10,positive
This is a fantastic film. The acting is some of the best I've seen. Tatyana Samojlova is obviously very beautiful  and she automatically draws you into the film with her believable acting. The The cinematography was extremely ahead of its time. Watching it  I could see parallels of cinematography used today. This is truly a groundbreaking film. Because of the cinematography and acting  the audience can feel the change in tone from beginning to end as the tone in the environment in the movie changes. It's a very touching and powerful piece. My friend told me it was must see  and I definitely agree with her. This is one of those films that you watch and never forget. Everyone should see this intensely moving film. This should be put on everyone's Movies to See Before ________ (whatever) list.,positive
Fabulous cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky help to make this a stunning piece of work. The opening scenes are as if one is leafing through some master photographer's album and as the story begins to unfold we are swept away with both the events depicted and the beautiful look. All is well shot but there are several whole sequences that are simply breathtaking. Difficult to describe without 'spoiling' but suffice to say one is a very intense scene during an air raid and the lady left behind and her lover's brother are at odds as the sirens whine and the windows shatter. Another superimposes a swirling staircase and a spinning shot of tree tops and even develops into a fantasy sequence. Soviet film making of the highest order.,positive
This is one of my three all-time favorite movies. My only quibble is that the director  Peter Yates  had too many cuts showing the actors individually instead of together as a scene  but the performances were so great I forgive him.<br /><br />Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely marvelous; brilliant. The script is great  giving a very good picture of life in the theatre during World War II (and  therefore  what it was like in the 30s as well). Lots of great  subtle touches  lots of broad  overplayed strokes  all of it perfectly done. Scene after scene just blows me away  and then there's the heartbreaking climax.,positive
Director Mikhail Kalatozov's film The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli) is a glorious piece of cinema. From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov  based on his own play  Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home. Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage  the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable. However  this Russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way; by telling us  straight from a soldier's mouth how war is hated by all  that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting  we see a new vision of WWII. We have young men volunteering to wage war for peace  to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don't believe in. With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East  and how people are dying for no reason  against their will  it's nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are  as well as those awaiting their return.<br /><br />Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines  his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl Veronika  doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love. An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration. Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude. Whether this is all a glorified look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not  I don't know. There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country  it is all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not  protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday.<br /><br />The acting is top-notch throughout  but some deserve singling out. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris' grandmother. She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language. Vasili Merkuryev  as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich  brings what is perhaps the best performance. As spoken at the end  about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears  Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments. He puts on a tough exterior  especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave. But when Boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man  seated in sorrow at the table. He loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him  his actions throughout the film express it to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris  a happy-go-lucky young man  and idealist  doing what he believes is right  and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villainous Mark  staying home due to his talented piano skills  or maybe just to steal his cousin's love. That love  played by Tatyana Samojlova  really draws the audience in to her grief  dejection  and slim glimmer of hope. The true star of the film  she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way  needing to steer back on course  hoping that she did so soon enough for Boris' return.<br /><br />Besides the realism to the story  as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across  I also loved the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is amazing  especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen. It is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do so in a square frame. Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water  a bridge in the background at the top  as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance. There are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen  creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are utilized  as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together.<br /><br />The real feats  however  are those instances of the long shot. Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers  it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for Boris  her own farewell needing to be said. The planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people  the camera focuses on couples kisses  people yelling to one another  and more  all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through. Everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. It's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and mise en scène can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible. Composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders  adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do.,positive
Mikhail Kalatozov's The Cranes are flying is a superb film. Winner of the golden palm at Cannes Film Festival  it has an excellent cinematography and performance by Tatyana Samojlova  the only Russian actor ever to win an award in Cannes for a performance. She plays Veronika  a teenager in love with her boyfriend  happy and without preoccupations  with plans of getting married. Her life will get upside down when World War II strikes and her boyfriend volunteers to the army. The film depicts the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people that stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight  waiting for a letter or other information. It is a portrayal of lost innocence. Samojlova does a magnificent job  and her character transformation will break your heart. The camera movement is fast with a lot of close-ups  it is a dancing camera. The first scene in the stairs is fantastic  but it isn't the only one  there is later a scene when Veronika attempts committing suicide  and another  in my opinion one of the most powerful scenes in movie history  the bombing of Veronika's house when she runs the stairs in the middle of fire  to find her apartment completely destroyed. Simply great! 10 out of 10.,positive
Like in a circle the movie leads back to its point of departure  the image of the cranes that are crossing a Muscovite sky. They represent the freedom to realize your life as you wish  in order to aspire the greatest possible fulfilment.<br /><br />In the beginning Veronica and Boris experience such a promise of happiness  and their eyes follow the path of the cranes in exhilaration. It seems as if they might be able to live according to their dreams.<br /><br />But Man is not a bird. Life draws up its own rules  from which no human can escape and which we cannot change - not even by making a supreme effort. War breaks out  and without much hesitation Boris signs up for the front in order to fulfil his patriotic duty. He cannot even say good-bye to Veronica  for she arrives late at the assembly point from which the soldiers are sent away. Surrounded by a jubilant crowd all her attempts to attract Boris' attention must inevitably fail.<br /><br />Boris eventually gets killed in war  without Veronica learning about it for the moment. His brother Mark  a vigorous musician  who obtained the exemption from military service by corruption  is eager to take his place. Veronica initially resists  but in a frightful night of bombing she finally falls victim to his charms. A marriage takes place  which is never accepted by the family.<br /><br />Soon feelings of guilt seize hold of Veronica and she realizes that Boris' return is the one and only thing she actually longs for. She therefore eases her bad conscience and despair by the self-sacrificing work in a field hospital.<br /><br />When war finally is over  once again a crowd of enthusiastic people gathers in order to cheer the victorious soldiers. Again Veronica is among them  forcing her way through a wall of bodies. In her hand she is carrying a bunch of flowers  until she finally has to give it away to complete strangers  for one of the homecomers has just dashed her hopes by confirming the sad certainty of Boris' death.<br /><br />Once again the cranes invade the sky  drawing their wayward lines. But now Veronica is watching them on her own  and the look in her eyes is a different one. She has had to accept the impossibility to live according to preconceived plans  to follow the guidelines of your dreams. For all humans are nothing but helpless puppets hanging on the inscrutable strings of fate.<br /><br />,positive
It's not difficult  after watching this film  to see why post-silent Soviet cinema is held in such little critical esteem. Don't get me wrong. THE CRANES ARE FLYING is  for the first half at least  supremely entertaining  boasting a lightness of touch completely unexpected from its country of origin; a fresh  brisk  spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms; two stunning subjective set-pieces; and a romantic verve that flirts with  but never quite topples into  Lelouch territory. It's just that   in its subsuming of vast social  national and world events to a love affair  it is essentially no different from a conventional Hollywood movie.<br /><br />Of course  in a Soviet Union that emphasised the state above all else  and in an era (World War Two) that suppressed individualism and liberty to uphold murderous symbolism  this foregrounding of two appealing young lovers is a relief. And the thematic similarities - all consuming love rent apart by war - with two of the most wonderful of all films (SEVENTH HEAVEN  LES PARAPLUIES DE CHERBOURG) also adds to its potential loveability.<br /><br />The story is simple enough. Boris  a young factory worker from a bright medical and artistic family  and Veronika  a student  conduct a breezy relationship at night  their only free time. Boris's cousin Mark  a composer  also has eyes on Veronika. When the Nazis invade Russia  Boris secretly volunteers  to the chagrin of his family and lover. He promises to write to Veronika  but never does  thinking maybe she hasn't bothered to see him off  or perhaps the mail is simply unreliable. Veronika's parents die during an air raid  and she moves in with Boris's family  helping out at the hospital where his father tends wounded soldiers.<br /><br />Distressed by Boris's silence  Veronika is also assailed by the attentions of Mark  who has gained exemption from military duty by bribing a local official. She is eventually worn down  and marries him  to the disapproval of her adopted family. Boris  meanwhile  is killed in action. Veronika  disgusted with herself and an adulterous Mark  refuses to believe this  and awaits his return  fostering a young orphan bearing his name.<br /><br />The title refers to the birds the couple see at the height of their love  symbolic perhaps of its transcendant  epiphanical power. But this is illusory - the cranes fly in a V formation  and this shape pervades the entire film  through the geometric shapes of buildings  interiors  exteriors  groupings of people  composition  camera angles  the heroine's name - or by editing in which feet walking southwest in one story are met by feet walking southeast in another. <br /><br />This serves to fatally trap the lovers who have no control over their destinies  and also suggest the Stalinist power that is never  specifically  mentioned in the film. Although the pair seem to be free in space  whether literally in an unpeopled environment  or privileged in generous close-ups  they are always ironised  minimised  torn apart - by circumstances  families  by crowds (see the brilliant  if obvious  sequences where Veronika is engulfed by tanks  or the pair fail to meet in a huge crowd)  or simply by the film's structure  which is constantly distancing  through paralellism  their closeness. Although at the beginning  the lightness and brightness of style suggest a beautiful romantic idyll  it is constantly being broken by strange edits or camera angles of distracting snatches of music.<br /><br />What is most remarkable is how these blocks to romance are achieved by abstracting rather than emphasising historical forces. The whole film  but especially the war itself  is strangely unreal and dreamlike  we are never shown its harsh  brutal actuality  just its effects on the lovers. In fact  it is transformed into a majestic spectacle  devoid of nasty Germans. <br /><br />On the home front  the air raids create delicious effects of light and shade  or ruins of almost Gothic decadence. In the bunker  the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than Boris's perceived indifference. The empty  oneiric Moscow spaces the lovers initially  than Veronika with her mother  walk though are less actual locations than emotional spaces. <br /><br />When Mark tries to force himself on Veronika  the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations. This is a brilliant sequence  filmed with silent  Expressionistic terror  in which the screen seems to burst with hysteria and violence  all the more compelling for the earlier scenes' wistful gentleness.<br /><br />It's not much different at the front either  where fights over girls' honour are more urgent than tactics  Nazis or despair. The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade into a final space is a further abstracting of the experience of war  its setting in a forest giving it a sexual dynamic; and Boris' final  pre-death flashback is an extraordinary mixture of dream-wish fulfillment and heightened anxiety  in which what is wished for becomes menacing and grotesque.<br /><br />From this point on the film becomes a little less interesting  slightly more obvious. One more grasp for Expressionist overload - Veronika's attempted suicide and her rescuing the infant - is clumsily handled; and her sombre guilt casts a paralysing shadow over the whole film. The use of deep focus  at first ravishing  soon becomes wearing  devoid as it is of any of the moral force or meaning Welles brought to its use in CITIZEN KANE. After what seems a quietly sly critique of totalitarianism in favour of the individual is cruelly betrayed at the end  when individual suffering  as so often in Russian art  transmutes into symbolic (i.e. sexless  dehumanised) hope. A pity.,positive
Unlike the many who have posted here  I'm not movie literate. I stumbled across this movie by accident (channel surfing)  and couldn't surf away. This is a truly incredible movie  worthy of all the praise the critics and those on this site have heaped on it. The actors are terrific. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her fiancé Boris is sweet and patriotic. You couldn't help but feel Boris' father's exasperation and sorrow as he upbraids his son for such foolishness as volunteering to serve in the great war.<br /><br />Others have summarized the movie so well  so I'll just mention a couple of scenes that moved me the most. When Boris' brother reveals to his family that he has broken trust with his brother and has to marry Tatiana  Tatiana's twisted mouth shows her revulsion at this betrayal (even though her part in the unfaithfulness might have been through rape). You fear that the rest of the movie might right this wrong by visiting just destruction on Tatiana and the brother  or worse  show Tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent into cigarette smoking decadence. Since this isn't French existential cinema  the latter doesn't happen. Thankfully! <br /><br />Another scene that tears at your heart is when the unnamed musician soldier who was saved by Boris returns to tell Boris' father of the death of his son. He unwittingly breaks the news to Tatiana. I can't describe the sorrow of this scene... Still Tatiana finds finds a straw to grab and hope that Boris will yet come home. The musician actually never saw Boris buried  after all.<br /><br />I won't mention more scenes  but do want to observe that the touches of Soviet political correctness didn't detract at all from the film. Boris' brother is revealed as the piano playing anti-soviet slacker that someone who steals his brother's wife-to-be would have to be. No doubt he gets at least a tenner at the conclusion of the film! The ending  when Tatiana finally learns for certain that Boris is dead  still manages to end with cheerfully and full of hope for the future. You don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that must have swept through the theater when survivors of that war  with their own losses in mind  first saw this movie.<br /><br />Incredible. Go see it.,positive
"The aftermath of World War Two almost resulted in the death of Soviet cinema. In the early years of the 1950s  film production came close to a complete standstill {a mere nine feature-films were released in 1951}  and the work of all filmmakers was closely monitored  and often censored  by the government. Following the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953  filmmakers were given greater artistic freedom with their pictures  though many remained reluctant to challenge the heroic  optimistic and propagandistic stance towards warfare that had been prevalent in previous years. It wasn't until 1957 that director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Viktor Rozov became bold enough to produce what is widely-considered the first post-Stalin Soviet masterpiece  'Letyat zhuravli / The Cranes are Flying ' one of the finest depictions of war I've seen from any country or time period. Not only was the film lauded for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union  but international recognition was soon to follow  and Kalatozov's film was honoured with the Palm d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival.<br /><br />'The Cranes are Flying' is both an invigorating visual feast and an audacious  humanistic portrayal of war. Unlike many Soviet war-themed films of the time  it was less constrained by the archetypal figure of the traditional war-time hero  and more concerned with the futility  brutality and  indeed  the inevitability of conflict. Love  as a cinematic concept  is too-often idealised as a notion that somehow conquers all and endures endless hardship  and yet the reality is substantially less romantic. In the film  two lovers  Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov)  separated by the advent of the WWII {widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War  1941-1945}  pledge to marry after the war  but tragedy denies the couple their wish. Driven to betrayal by the unending torment and uncertainty of waiting  Veronika agrees to wed Boris' cousin  Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin)  a handsome but unworthy youth. The film may conclude with the proud victory of the Soviets  and a patriotic flag-waving parade  but the optimism of this sequence is overwhelmingly eclipsed by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist  who wanders soullessly through the celebrating crowds.<br /><br />Perhaps the most remarkable feature of 'The Cranes are Flying' is Sergei Urusevsky's inspired and dynamic hand-held cinematography  which realistically and dizzily captures the chaos and confusion of war  not necessarily in the hail of gunfire and the cries of dying comrades {in fact  only one of the film's sequences joins Boris on the Eastern Front}  but from the perspective of the family and friends who are left behind. In one particularly impressive  oft-cited long shot  the camera follows Veronika as she frantically searches for Boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families. The hand-held camera smoothly follows the girl off a bus  jostles through the crowd alongside her - capturing momentary snippets of loved ones saying farewell to their sons and husbands - before unexpectedly craning above the crowd as Veronika disappears into the dust of a passing squadron of army tanks  a breathtaking movement that offers scope and urgency to the dramatic episode. Urusevsky first acquired his filming experience as a military cameraman during the war  and obviously fell in love with the storytelling possibilities of hand-held photography: The camera, he once declared  can express what the actor is unable to portray: his inner sensations. The cameraman must act with the actors.",positive
This movie won a special award at Cannes for its acting and it's not difficult to see why. (A few spoilers - but for the ending  you'll have to watch the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of war between Russia and Germany in WW II Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spat when she learns that he has enlisted in the army. Boris leaves for the front before Veronika can tell him she loves him. Boris is shot but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family. Mark  Boris' cousin  rapes Veronika who feels obligated to marry him. Degraded and demeaned by the cowardly Mark  Veronika clings to the hope that someday Boris will return. Superb camera-work and wonderful set pieces by director Kalatozov. (For anyone interested in film technique another movie by Kalatozov  I AM CUBA  has at least two superb set pieces - one of them a long tracking shot that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana  rises two stories to a cigar factory  tracks though the window and follows the procession down a long  long avenue - all without a cut.) Superb acting  particularly by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris' uncle) that is made all the more poignant by sheer understatement. A devastatingly romantic movie with a heart-stopping performance by Samoilova. (This movie is frequently linked with the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.),positive
Russian actress TATIANA SAMOILOVA reminds me so much of the young Audrey Hepburn and the camera in THE CRANES ARE FLYING seems to love her just as much. She is the focal point of a bittersweet war romance against the background of World War II in Moscow.<br /><br />The film is almost poetic in its gorgeous B&W cinematography which was the main reason for watching the film in the first place  since I had never heard of it and decided to give it a try when it aired on TCM.<br /><br />It's a very moving love story about a girl's deep love for a man who is suddenly swept away by his role as a soldier drafted in wartime Russia. She's unable to forget the memory of her romantic attachment to him  but inexplicably marries someone else who has forced himself on her  a pianist who soon realizes that she still loves the soldier she hopes to hear from. Their marriage is a troubled one because she can't let go of her remembrance of a happier time with her soldier sweetheart.<br /><br />By the end of the story  she accepts the idea that he's never going to return and is able to face reality and cope with the situation. There's a very poignant final scene at a train station where arriving soldiers are greeting their loved ones and the tearful girl shares the joy of the returning soldiers by giving some flowers from her bouquet to the joyous families.<br /><br />The stylish and striking camera-work is what carries the film  as well as the honestly played story.<br /><br />Tastefully done  but perhaps the English subtitles didn't tell the whole tale because some of the plot elements seemed a bit blurred to me as if they had been glossed over.<br /><br />Summing up: Easy to see why it won awards at the Cannes Film Festival. Reminded me  in style  of another great Russian film  BALLAD OF A SOLDIER.,positive
While watching this film recently  I constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957..........and in the USSR! That makes it all the more remarkable. Many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in 2002  but they were quite original in 1957. I first saw this film in 1963  when it was first released in the US  and I was struck by its originality then. Now just having seen it 40 years later  I have no reason to change my mind.,positive
I had long wanted to watch this romantic drama (with a WWII setting) and  now that I have  all I can say is that it's a veritable masterpiece of Russian cinema! <br /><br />Soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but  thankfully  this one's free of such emphasis - with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl  doomed by the outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteers but from which he'll never return. The girl (a remarkable performance from Tatyana Samojlova) is also loved by the young man's cousin and  when she doesn't receive word from her boyfriend  gives in to the latter and marries him. He  however  is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and  knowing too that the girl's still devoted to the soldier  begins to neglect her. Finally  word reaches the girl of her loved one's death but  by the end of the film  she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of him.<br /><br />The film features some truly amazing camera-work which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and  by frequently adopting tracking  tilted and high or low angle shots  renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama. Individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular: the stunning scene  frenetically edited and sped-up to boot  in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck; and the young man's premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front  undoubtedly one of the best of its kind I've ever watched (with the sun moving away from him  symbolizing the life that's seeping out of his body  as he imagines the wedding day he'll never have!). Also notable  however  is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home that's been hopelessly devastated during an air raid; as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist - which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face - taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtains!<br /><br />Disappointingly  the R1 DVD of this outstanding film is a bare-bones affair (the RusCiCo edition features a few supplements but  being an export  tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot!); Criterion released it in conjunction with another war-themed Russian classic  BALLAD OF A SOLDIER (1959) - which my pal at the local DVD rental outlet has told me is forthcoming... <br /><br />The only other film I've watched from this director is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT (1969; albeit via the much-shorter U.S.-release version!)  a star-studded international production based on true events; given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING  I regret missing out now on his famous documentary I AM CUBA (1964) a number of times when I was in Hollywood late last year: apart from receiving a one-week theatrical run  it was shown more than once on TV accompanied by a feature-length Making Of!!,positive
A true masterpiece of the Soviet cinematography. It's a shame for the Soviet Union that Samojlova was never given an opportunity to play in the Western movies -- but then again  she would probably never find herself there. In Letyat Zhuravli  she is unforgettable. This was one of the few movies where I was crying...<br /><br />In addition to Samojlova  Batalov and Merkurjev  who are top rate  it was a brilliant work of the director and the operator which made this movie an all-time classics world-wide. Just remember the scenes of piano music and proposal under the heavy German bombardment  or the death of Boris with a swirling sky above his head and his last visions appeared blurred in those skies. The very simple means -- but the great technique added to the emotional weight... Mind you  20 years before The Star Wars  41 years before Titanic  and with a Soviet budget.,positive
In Moscow  the young couple Veronika (T. Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are in deep love for each other. With the World War II  Boris volunteers to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before Veronika's birthday  and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other. While waiting for news from Boris  Veronika is raped by Boris' cousin Mark (A. Shvorin) and they marry each other. However  Veronika does not forget Boris  and keeps waiting for him.<br /><br />Letyat zhuravli is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in times of war. The direction is excellent and uses ellipses along the story  inclusive in the capital scene when Veronika is raped by Mark. The camera-work is amazing  with sophisticated planes and angles  and long traveling. The scenes of Veronika in the middle of the tanks  or in the train station with many figurants are awesome. The magnificent cinematography is highlighted by the restored image of the DVD. T. Samojlova has an extremely beautiful face  and a touching and sensitive performance. The speech in the last scene makes another great example of an anti-war movie. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Quando Voam as Cegonhas (When Fly the Stork),positive
It does not surprise me that this short (91 minutes) B/W movie that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called ottepel' or the thaw  has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world. It is sublime and beautifully filmed. Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time. Sergei Urusevsky's camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated. The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman. It is also the film about loyalty  memories  ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for; it is about forgiveness  and about hope. The film received (absolutely deservingly) the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special award at Cannes for playing Veronika  the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie. After separation with her beloved who went to the front  the loss of her family in the bomb ride  and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed  she turned to the shadow of herself  she became dead inside. Her long journey to redemption  to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it  is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply won't leave any viewer indifferent.<br /><br />For me  the movie is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning. I walked the same streets  squares  and bridges over the Moskva River. Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger  cold  and illnesses during WWII and my family is not exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books. Cranes are Flying speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply. It is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life - my background  my memory  and my past.,positive
One of those films that I happened across through The Criterion Collection and as usual indulged as a change of pace. That turned out to be a great decision. I was almost mesmerised by the quality of the film  the story it told and the way it was told. The almost minimalist feel to the film with sparse dialogue and almost constant music just added a whole evocative level to the film. This really is a superb film to spend some time with and enjoy.,positive
I would like to tell you just a few things before considering seeing this movie. If at one point or another you thought you've seen good camera work  be prepared to be amazed by this movie. For the record  this movie was made in 1957 in Russia  but the technique used here is probably something that we've seen much later in the western world...about 20 years later. The level of emotions through the film varies quite a lot: happiness -love-war- despair-joy  but in the end you remain with something quite unique: the joy of seeing one masterpiece of filmmaking. The young directors from our time should study more this kind of movies and maybe they will be able to create something similar..even though I think movies like this are very hard to come by... If you've seen I am Cuba   then this movie would appeal to you very much  but if not  be prepared for a unique experience. The Russian directors have something in common: very small budgets  great actors  and a joy of creating art...and yes  they are able to create more masterpieces than all the western world together. I am not a big fan of Russia  actually I hate everything that's communist  but the film making in that part of the world  manages to create such feelings that are hard to describe.<br /><br />Enjoy it.<br /><br />,positive
The plot of this movie is set against the most terrible war in history of mankind: the violent clash between Adolf Hitler's Germany and Soviet Russia  from 1941-'45.<br /><br />With the western areas of their country thoroughly devastated  and 20 to 30 million Russian people killed  the vibes of this conflict can be felt in Russia up to the present day. Let alone back in 1957  when memories were still very fresh and painful.<br /><br />This very black setting strongly contrasts with the fine and coherent style of 'Letjat zhuravli's' beautiful shots. Its simple story deals with human behaviour in times of war: bravery  love  patriotism  weakness  cowardice and corruption. All beautifully tied together by a toy-squirrel.<br /><br />Add to this the truly magnificent acting  and it's easy to understand why this movie is so famous. Really  one of the very best ever made. <br /><br />,positive
Love and war did happen on the other side of the iron curtain and by looking losely at it love was just as strong as in the West and war was often more poignant (should I say more realistic ?).<br /><br />This film is as much about war and love as it is about the Soviet thaw of Mr K's era. It also reminds us than the best war movies were not necessarily made in the 1990's with rivers of hemoglobin and millions of USD spent on special effects and marketed actors.<br /><br />This movie is a classic of Soviet cinema and a outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies : war.<br /><br />,positive
If you're looking for a typical war movie  this is not it  so a note to all the testosterone-pumped carnage-craving war buffs out there  don't bother. Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII  don't expect to see any Nazis  cannons  blood  gore  etc. It's not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war. It's a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with it.<br /><br />Acting  cinematography  writing: all perfect 10s here. You'll certainly appreciate it if you're Russian like me  but even if not  you'll probably love it. If you speak no Russian  look for the RUSCICO (Russian Cinema Council) DVD version. It's got subtitles in about 14 different languages  but the English dubbing on this one I'd say is just as good. It's of course not as good as the original Russian track (some stuff is lost in translation)  but just as good as the English subtitles. So go check it out  especially if you're studying film in any aspect.,positive
"1956 was the 20th Congress of the Communist Party and the Soviet Premier Krushchev made a speech denouncing Stalin and the Stalinist purges and the gulag labor systems  revealing information that was previously forbidden  publicly revealing horrible new truths  which opened the door for a new Soviet Cinema led by Mikhail Kalatozov  once Stalin's head of film production. This film features a Red Army that is NOT victorious  in fact they are encircled  in a retreat mode  with many people dying  including the hero  in a film set after 06-02-41  the German invasion of Russia when Germany introduced the Barbarossa Plan  a blitzkrieg invasion intended to bring about a quick victory and the ultimate enslavement of the Slavs  and very nearly succeeded  actually getting within 20 miles of Moscow in what was a Red Army wipe out  a devastation of human losses  15 to 20 million Russians died  or 20% of the entire population. Historically  this was a moment of great trauma and suffering  a psychological shock to the Russian people  but the Red Army held and prolonged the war 4 more years until they were ultimately victorious. <br /><br />During the war  Stalin used the war genre in films for obvious morale boosting  introducing female heroines who were ultra-patriotic and strong and idealistic  suggesting that if females could be so successful and patriotic  then Russia could expect at least as much from their soldiers. Stalin eliminated the mass hero of the proletariat and replaced it with an individual  bold leader who was successful at killing many of the enemy  an obvious reference to Stalin himself  who was always portrayed in film as a bold  wise and victorious leader. But Kalatozov changed this depiction  as THE CRANES ARE FLYING was made after Stalin's death  causing a political thaw and creating a worldwide sensation  winning the Cannes Film Festival Palm D'Or  as well as the Best Director and Best Actress (Tatyana Samoilova)  reawakening the West to Soviet Cinema for the first time since Eisenstein's IVAN THE TERRIBLE in the 40's. <br /><br />This film featured brilliant  breathtaking  and extremely mobile camera work from his extraordinary cinematographer Sergei Uresevsky  using spectacular crane and tracking shots  images of wartime  battlefields  Moscow and crowded streets that are extremely vivid and real. Another brilliant scene features the lead heroine  Veronica  who hasn't heard from her lover  Boris  in the 4 years at war  so he is presumed dead  but she continues to love him  expressed in a scene where she runs towards a bridge with a train following behind her  a moment when the viewer was wondering if she might throw herself in front of that train  instead she saves a 3 yr old boy named Boris who was about to be hit by a car. Another scene captures the death of Boris on the battlefield  who dies a senseless death  and his thoughts spin and whirl in a beautiful montage of trees  sky  leaves  all spinning in a kaleidoscope of his own thoughts and dreams  including an imaginary wedding with Veronica. This film features the famous line  You can dream when the war is over. In the final sequence  when the war is over  the soldiers are returning in a mass scene on the streets  Veronica learns Boris died  all are happy and excited with the soldier's return  but Veronica is in despair  passing out flowers to soldiers and strangers on the street in an extreme gesture of generosity and selflessness revealing cranes white and gray floating in the sky. <br /><br />The film was released in 1957 in Russia  and according to some reviews  the silence in the theater was profound, the wall between art and living life had fallen...and tears unlocked the doors. <br /><br /> <br /><br />",positive
The many other comments about the film say it all - just like to add that we showed it last week to around 30 at our Community Cinema  and it got an overall average score of 8.6. We'd 100% recommend it  then  for today's audiences  especially if they can see it on a real cinema screen  and can talk about it with others afterwards  as our audience did.<br /><br />The sheer power of the acting performances by the whole troupe was incredible and quite spellbinding. Of course  Finney and Courtenay were truly the stars. but everybody was thoroughly well cast. For our afternoon audience  the majority of whom are senior citizens  the fact that the plot could be followed with such ease because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non-techy use of camera and sound was a great influence<br /><br />How delightful  many said  to see a really great film that's British: still not dated twenty years on: not full filled with blood & guts: not confusing because of bob-about-all-over-the-place camera shots  and back and forth through time story lines: no seedy sex scenes. Such views were even uttered by some who were younger.,positive
"The story told by The Cranes are Flying is not  admittedly  all that original. Young lovers are separated by war; bad things happen to both. We've seen it many times before.<br /><br />Nonetheless  we haven't seen it filmed this well  with bold shots that take liberties to emphasize separation  or destruction  or hopelessness. All the more remarkable coming from the Soviet Union  and reason to conclude that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern-era Soviet cinema.<br /><br />I was reading Chekhov's Three Sisters the other day  and chanced upon what may be the meaning of the title of this film. In Act 2  Masha objects to the notion that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding:<br /><br />MASHA: Surely mankind must believe in something, or at least seek for the truth, otherwise life is just emptiness, emptiness. To live and not to know why the cranes are flying, why children are born, why there are stars in the sky. Either you must know why it is you live, or everything is trivial - mere pointless nonsense.<br /><br />Likewise  Veronika has a hard time believing that the war  and her and others' sufferings  have been pointless. Better to assign a meaning  to live as if one's life is significant  and not to give in to despair. It is perhaps this thinking that prompts her to her final act in the film.<br /><br />BTW as a minor correction to one other comment here--there may be a pattern of V's in the film  though I hadn't noticed them myself. But the first letter of Veronika's name is not a further instance of this; in the Cyrillic alphabet  her name begins with a letter which looks like an English B.",positive
Having long disdained network television programming  I remember the first time I caught an episode of Police Squad!. It was totally by accident. It was during the show's initial network run on ABC in early 1982. I am a chronic channel surfer and was flipping the dial one evening when suddenly appeared Police Squad!'s opening credit sequence on my TV screen. I immediately recognized it as a sendup of the opening credits of M-Squad starring Lee Marvin  one of my all-time favorite cop shows. I stopped surfing. Then of course came headquarters getting shot up  followed by the immortal Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln. By now I was saying to myself What the heck is THIS??. Then came special guest star Georg Stanford Brown getting flattened by a plummeting safe. I was hooked from that moment. The episode was Ring of Fear/A Dangerous Assignment  with its comic references to On The Waterfront  and Muhammed Ali  but most memorable of course were all the sight gags and non sequiturs. Leslie Nielsen and Alan North in their loose parody of Lee Marvin and Paul Newlan of M Squad were an absolute riot. Finally  I said to myself  A network television program truly worth watching!!!. Wouldn't you know it would be canceled just a few weeks later. Leave it to the networks -- I should have known. Anyway  I just bought the DVD collection of all six episodes and they are just as funny today as they were 27 years ago. The Naked Gun movies were terrific as well  but I really missed Alan North (he was so good as Ed Hocken)  Peter Lupus as Nordberg (what were they thinking casting OJ in that part?)  and especially William Duell's Johnny the shoeshine guy. Great stuff.,positive
Nothing like this was seen on TV at that time and probably never will again. From the first image of that police light blinding you and from there you heard the words: Police Squad - in color  you were schocked to see that this in no way was an ordinary sitcom.<br /><br />Also to kill off a Guest Star and then never refer to him again  where had you ever seen that before. Then the actual show started and if you did not pay attention  you would miss several jokes in the background. Don't pay too much attention to one thing or you would be sorry. This was the show that video recorders were made for  way before Married with Children or The Simpsons.<br /><br />The stories did in no way make sense and the dialog was sometimes so weird that you had to think about it for 5 minutes before realising that it was a joke.<br /><br />The characters Frank Drebin and Ed Hocken came right out of Dragnet and they were absolutely straight (no funny accents or expressions) but instead there were puns and twisted sentences played absolutely deadpan. Only once as I can remember  were there a segment played for silly laughs - a scene involving a trip to a dentist  suction and a whole lot of saliva.<br /><br />There were some tedious moments - like the informer Johnny and an appearance by some celebrity. That was strictly a one-joke moment but they had to use it in all six episodes. Oh  well. Everything can't be perfect. The important thing is that the rest of the time you were knee deep in tears of laughter.<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen was fortunate that this revived his career when they put the Frank Drebin character in 3 features but it must have been an Achilles heel as well. Can you remember seeing him in anything except Naked Gun type work since? And don't count the awful Mr. Magoo reworked for live action. He probably made a lot of money  though.,positive
Two years after the success of 'Airplane'  Jim Abrahams and Jerry & David Zucker created this brilliant sitcom starring the great Leslie Nielsen as plain clothed detective 'Frank Drebin'. Also in the cast was Alan North as 'Captain Ed Hocken'  Ed Williams as 'Ted Olsen' and William Duell as 'Johnny The Shoe Shine Boy'. 'Police Squad!' featured unashamedly corny jokes and clever visual gags playing in the background. Each episode would conclude with a mock freeze frame in which the characters in frame stand completely still. One of the best 'freeze frame' sequences saw one of the characters pouring coffee into a cup while standing still  causing the cup to overflow! Guest stars were killed off in the opening titles  one included Georg Stanford Brown being crushed by a falling safe! Despite gaining positive reviews and much critical acclaim  'Squad!' only lasted for six episodes before being cancelled. This didn't mean the end though  five years later the show was transferred to the big screen for the first in the trilogy of the 'Naked Gun' films.,positive
I remember watching Police Squad! when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show  thanks to the many sight gags  non sequitors and scripts filled with word play. In one episode  there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice. <br /><br />But unfortunately  ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode. One that I remember was in the opening where the episode's title was different from the one shown on the screen. <br /><br />Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Frank Drebin was deadpan  yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus  in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible wasn't bad as Norberg  But the one character that stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy  played by William Duell. After giving advice to Drebin  there were cameos from Dick Clark  Dr. Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda. <br /><br />Even though Police Squad! had a short life on ABC  the Zucker Brothers didn't give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise. I'll close with a regular closing gag. Freeze the ending right here.,positive
A criminally short lived show that went on to spawn three movie spin-offs (Naked Gun 1  2 & 3)  this is fast-paced  in your face  rapid fire comedy that has more hits than misses. <br /><br />Leslie Nielsen plays Detective Lieutenant Sergeant Frank Drebin  an incompetent Detective who bumbles and fumbles his way through cases  with the capable assistant of his boss  Capt. Ed Hocken.<br /><br />The story lines are spurious  at best  but it's deliberate  as the goodness here lies not in the storytelling  but in the weaving of a constant flurry of jokes along with some genuinely weird and wonderful characters. <br /><br />The jokes themselves come in many forms  be it wordplay  slapstick  puns or background gags  most of them hitting the spot  though some fall a little flat. It's inevitable with this 'gag every few seconds' approach that some will fail  but the ratio is good. <br /><br />The characters are a delight. From the guest star of the week dying in the opening seconds of every episode  the laboratory scientist who appears to be conducting cruel and unusual experiments on children to the shoe-shine who is some form of oracle  the writing is witty and sharp as a cutlass. <br /><br />Though not especially successful at the time  it rapidly developed a cult following  many blaming the shows' relative lack of success on being way ahead of its time and too sophisticated for the target audience  chief amongst them none other than Matt 'The Simpsons' Groening: and he should know. <br /><br />Dated by todays standards  if you can see through that aspect  you're in for a treat.,positive
The inspiration for the Naked Gun movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who had only recently started doing comedy* - as the incompetent but heroic Frank Drebin  always having to solve an absurd case. Like Airplane! and the movies based on the series  the humor relies on Mel Brooks-style spot gags and silly comments (namely the yes it is remarks)  along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him. And of course  the final frame  in which something keeps moving.<br /><br />It's too bad that the show only had six episodes. At least it spawned the movies. You can't go wrong with Leslie Nielsen in these sorts of roles. I suspect that they all had fun filming it. Really funny.<br /><br />*Before Airplane!  Leslie Nielsen had starred in movies like Forbidden Planet  Harlow and The Poseidon Adventure. As late as 1987 he co-starred in Nuts alongside Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss. But since the first Naked Gun movie it's been all comedy all the time.,positive
When I was young  I was a big fan of the Naked Gun movies but just recently I watched the show Police Sqaud! and I think its great! Leslie Nielson's awesome  Alan North is cool  and who the heck is Rex Hamilton? But anyways  it's one goofy show.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of this show when they do the freeze frame scene during the end credits. I think my favorite one is when Norberg (not O.J.) walks in during the scene and he tries to fit in with the freeze frame. Classic!<br /><br />The only problem to me is the cigarette gag gets very old (when Drebin shows a cigarette to someone and asks  Cigarette? and the person replies  Yes. I know.) I think they used it too many times by whatever.<br /><br />Good acting  good gags  great show!<br /><br />7/10,positive
The creative team of Jim Abrahams  David Zucker and Jerry Zucker had their roots in improvisational theatre in Madison  Wisconsin  I believe it was. They had a group called 'Kentucky Fried Theatre'(or something similar.) They put a bunch of their set pieces onto celluloid as'KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE'(1977)  which was long  irreverent  sophomoric and really funny.<br /><br />They followed up with the very popular  AIRPLANE! (1980)  which really put them on the map. In it  they took some rather well known veteran actors in Robert Stack and (especially) Leslie Nielsen  and putting them in prominent roles  proceeded to parody every cliché of every aviation film since the days of John Wayne's (Batjac)Production of THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY (1954).* Pockets stuffed with cash and now having been noticed  the trio worked out a deal with Pramount Television and the American Broadcasting Company TV Network to do a half hour comedy spoof of the nearly countless Police Crime Drama show that have come and gone on our television screens over the years. Remembering the fine job that Mr. Leslie Nielsen had turned in on AIRPLANE!  he was cast in the lead.<br /><br />As Sgt/Lt./Captain Frank Drebbin (the rank designation switch being one of their comic bits) he presided over a great series of successive puns  sight gags  non sequitors  and overblown police/crime clichés.All of these strung together by some seemingly standard scripts. Added to this is overly dramatic opening narration  voiced over information contradicting the visual printed info. They always used this in giving the title of the episode titles  where voice and printed titles never matched.<br /><br />They had a great musical score  which even though being somewhat exaggerated  would have passed as theme and incidental music in a straight drama.The musical score  the opening titles and format of having the episodes divided into Act I  Act II  Epilogue  etc.  were all part of obvious  but affectionate  ribbing of Q.M. (Quinn Martin) Productions. (They even had the same announcer as did the real Q.M.'s.)<br /><br />One thing that this all too short of a series did not have was a technically augmented audience laughter. And  boy they sure didn't need any phony tract. The nature of the spoof was such that it demanded the viewer's close  almost undivided attention  and that proved to be the ultimate reason behind POLICE SQUAD's downfall.<br /><br />In regards to the series cancellation an ABC Executive explained that the episodes ...called for too much attention on the part of the viewer. So  isn't that what one would want?<br /><br />So  after only 6 wonderfully wacky  hilarious episodes off to the afterlife of series cancellation went POLICE SQUAD!  only to be reborn in THE NAKED GUN trilogy  made for the big screen in movie houses. Once again  they did quite well at the Box Office. Oh well  TV's loss is Cinema's gain  thanks to you Mr. Idiot TV Exec!<br /><br />* THE HIGH AND MIGHTY was produced by the Duke's own Batjac Productions and released by Warner Brothers. It was unavailable for quite a number of years and finally  Mr. Wayne's family made arrangements to release it to television and to video.,positive
The Dresser is a small but absolutely wonderful film  brilliantly acted by Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay. How in the world this tiny film attracted enough attention to garner five major Academy Award nominations back in 1983 is a mystery to me  but it's nice to know the Academy can be guilty of a display of good taste every once in a while (of course  they gave the award that year to Terms of Endearment-- after all  they don't want to be accused of showing TOO much taste).<br /><br />Albert Finney is a drunken Shakespearean actor in a production of King Lear; Tom Courtenay is the man who works double time behind the scenes to keep this actor in front of the footlights. It's both hilarious and piteous to see Courtenay's character showering Finney's with attention and affection  only to see his efforts utterly unappreciated and dismissed  even up to the very bitter end. Finney and Courtenay work wonders together  and though Finney gets the showiest moments (he does get to recite Shakespeare after all)  Courtenay is the heart and soul of the film.<br /><br />Grade: A,positive
After reading over all these reviews I'm very surprised to see that no one has even once noted that this show was based on the 1957 to 1960 NBC cop show M Squad starring Lee Marvin  i read reviews comparing it to Dragnet and some of the Quinn Martin police shows  but if you watch M Squad you'll see it was based on it. In the late 1958 episodes of M Squad onwards  you'll see Lee Marvin who plays Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger get out of his car and then hes shot at and he shoots back  the beginning of Police Squad is basically the same ( including the Jazz music) and then Lee Marvin narrates what goes on  (Im Lieutenant Detective Frank Ballinger M Squad a special department of the Chicago police) and in Police Squad Leslie Neilsen does the same (Im Detective Lieutenant Frank Drebin  Police Squad  a special division of the Police Department) and so on  in one of the M Squad episodes there's even the Johnny the shoeshine guy character and in a M Squad episode entitled  More Deadly there's a Police Squad episode entitled A Substantial Gift (The Broken Promise) which is the same story!,positive
Police Squad! (1982) was a funny show that ended too soon. But I guess it had it's run before it got too repetitive and unfunny like so many American television shows. The geniuses behind this funny show were the team of Zucker  Abrahams and Zucker. Every since his straight act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE!  Leslie Nielsen has found a new career as a comedian. In this short lived t.v. series he had the chance to play the straight man in a wacky comedy once more. The bizarre titles to each episode gave away the ending. But Lt. Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) got into so many weird cases that they have to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Tooo bad they never released this on D.V.D. If a show needed to be re-released it would have to be this one. A whole new generation is waiting to see this show!<br /><br />Highly recommended!,positive
"The funniest show ever on TV  albeit the humor is not for everyone. I realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer  but it's a shame only six episodes were filmed. The gags fly rapidly from the opening credits until the very end  when you would see Drebin and his boss  Ed Hocken  pretending to be in freeze frame as the closing credits rolled  during which the criminal (still moving) would see everyone else motionless and try to escape. In another episode  the building started collapsing around them as Drebin and Hocken remained in freeze mode.<br /><br />Leslie Nielsen was comedic brilliance as Frank Drebin and the perfect fit for this show  how he managed to keep a straight face through some of this is beyond me. Because the jokes and sight gags came so often and quick  you can watch the episodes a 2nd and 3rd time and catch things you missed the first time. If you're like me  you can watch them over and over and still find yourself laughing. Even the jokes that made no sense nor seemingly had any reason to them  such as the Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln tag-line in the opening announcement  somehow worked  perhaps they were thrown in there precisely for that reason.<br /><br />Cleverly spoofing the old Quinn Martin detective/cop shows of the 1970s  Police Squad would return from commercial break with the words Act Two appearing on the screen  which was immediately followed by Yankees One or some other quip. On the opening credits  the episode's title would appear on the screen  but the announcer would utter a completely different title. My favorite jokes and lines from this series are way too numerous to list  but one of my favorites is when Drebin asks a down-on-his-luck boxer who has previously tanked fights  Do you think you can beat the Champ? The boxer responds  I can take him blindfolded! To which Drebin responds back  But what if he's not blindfolded? A minute later  in reference to the boxer's small  dingy apartment  Drebin tells him  I'm going to help you get out of this sewer. The next thing you see  Drebin is popping up through a manhole cover on the street! In another episode  Drebin and Hocken are questioning a bombing suspect's flimsy alibi. Drebin  not believing him  says  Alright, let's say you did go the movies. After a slight pause  Drebin  Hocken  and the suspect all look at the camera and in unison say  You did go the movies. A few moments later  when Drebin is forced to let the suspected bomber walk free due to lack of evidence  he storms away and angrily yells  Tell that bomber to take off! What's seen next is a cop giving the thumbs-up signal to a WWII-style plane on a runway right outside the building! While there were many classic Drebin quotes  one particularly memorable one was  Sorry to bother you Mrs. Twice. We would have come earlier, but your husband wasn't dead then. Another classic was  I'm a locksmith  and, I'm a locksmith. When a visibly shaken kidnap victim's father asks Drebin  What I do I do?  Drebin  in classic deadpan fashion  responds back  Well, as I understand it, you're in the textile business. As I said  the humor is not for everyone  many people simply will not get it. During the show's brief run  I remember the reaction being very mixed. Some people thought it was absolutely hysterical and one of the funniest things around  while others thought it was the stupid and unfunny. For me  Police Squad  even 20+ years later  is the funniest thing I've ever seen on TV. For younger viewers who enjoy this type of humor but who have never seen Police Squad because they were too young when the series initially aired  I highly recommend. I found the six episodes to be even funnier than the subsequent Naked Gun movies.",positive
Two years after 'Airplane!' took off  Jim Abrahams  Jerry and David Zucker cast one of its stars - Leslie Nielsen - in this hilarious television series  a glorious take-off of old U.S. detective shows such as 'Dragnet'. Nielsen played Frank Drebin  America's answer to 'Inspector Clouseau'. It had the same style of humour as 'Airplane!'; clever visual gags in the background  unnoticed absurdities  and recurring characters such as Johnny the shoe-shine boy who seems to know everything about everything. Guest-stars ( including William Shatner! ) were killed off in the opening credits. 'Police Squad' was the first U.S. sitcom since 'Batman' to lack a laugh track. Many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were made  but I think it was about right. The concept could never have sustained a full 24-episode run. Five years later  'Police Squad' made a successful transfer to the big screen  when the first of the 'Naked Gun' trilogy was released. Jim  Jerry  David  and Leslie had the last laugh.,positive
"I still count Police Squad! as the absolute funniest TV show of the 1980s. Somewhere  on BetaMax no less  I have all six episodes. I knew that a show this good wouldn't last and that I had to preserve it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted as saying that viewers didn't know that Police Squad! was a comedy because it had no laugh track! Right! When Drebin has a line like You take chances just getting up in the morning, driving to work, or sticking your face in a fan.  how can THAT be comedy!?!? I've seen every episode at least ten times and still see something new I missed before. Even the deep backgrounds always have gags ongoing. Don't miss it if you have chance to see an episode  but if you're reading this then you probably already have copies squirreled away someplace as I do.",positive
I watched this series after I had seen the Naked Gun films. I found it much better than the films  and I thought the films were great! This series literally glues you to the television set in anticipation of the next pun  sight gag  or funny situation (the all night wicker place  club flamingo). I don't think I've ever laughed as hard at a TV series in my life  even after seeing the movies first and thus knowing some of the jokes. I think its a shame that only six episodes were produced  but I agree that the writers would be very hard pressed to maintain this level of comedy for any more episodes. Overall  the series is a must see for those who like puns  bad jokes  and slapstick sight-gags.,positive
The creative team that brought us Police Squad - and the Naked Gun derived from it - said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled  after their delivery of the first episode. Basically  the show was never given any chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that  for the show to be funny  the viewer would actually need to watch it; most shows are presented on TV with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while getting food  or going to the toilet  etc.<br /><br />The humor of the show is extremely dry (it uses no laugh-track)  and the universe the characters inhabit is one in which anything can happen  regardless of logic  as long as it was totally unbelievable; so  for instance in one episode a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgery.<br /><br />Those familiar with the Naked Gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the films. In the films  Nielsen developed a particular take approach - that is  eyes widened when confronted with the unexpected. This doesn't happen in the show  where Nielsen's Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - nothing is unexpected to him. Also  there are no romances in the show  and no parodies of MTV. Finally  the show takes certain risks that the films avoid; in the first episode  Drebin  to re-enact the crime  has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles - ballistics the hard way. This is actually a risky bit of humor  since we need to accept that it's perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime  for no other reason than experimentation. This sort of thing rarely happens in the films.<br /><br />Taken individually  each of the episodes is actually funnier than any one of the Naked Gun films  since they are both more compact (more happens in a shorter time-frame)  yet more leisurely paced (there's not the rush for a punch-line as sometimes happens in the films). There are some inconsistencies that happen in the films (primarily 2 and 3) that never occur in the show's shorter time-frame.<br /><br />Of course  there's no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema. And if you watch the TV show episode after episode in one sitting  the dry quality of the humor might wear away one's tolerance.<br /><br />None the less  it would be useful to have a DVD of this  and watch an episode a day for a few weeks - If laughter has  as some claim  medicinal value  watching this show is good for one's health.,positive
Extremely funny. More gags in each one of these episodes than in ten years of Friends. And with a good (ie. funny) Nordberg  not the fab-only-casted OJ Simpson in the movies. When will these episodes emerge on DVD?...,positive
To say that this is a good show is not to say anything at all. After all  this show is made by the same crew responsible for Airplane and other hilarious and brilliant movies. Writing is superb. Even though the show is built on one-liners  they don't become overbearing or annoying. Leslie Nielsen is flexing his comedy muscle to the full extent as if saying: You ain't seen nothing yet. The format was definitely polished to introduce Naked Gun. When watching these movies  notice how many schticks are taken from the TV show. The brilliant part is that they don't have to be changed too much. The show was truly a testing ground for bigger and better versions to come later.,positive
What is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews I have read here  is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film. While Courtenay's character is evidently gay  he is not the only one: the often talked about Mr. Davenport-Scott is the other  and the reason that he is never seen  the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in England at the time.<br /><br />We can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled Norman  Courtenay's character: and we can also see in a passing remark by Oxenby  the Edward Fox character  the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved: the fear of association affects many of the characters  and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it. The abandonment of Courtenay at the end by Sir has been anticipated all the way through  if this subtext is included: it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to. The flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that Courtenay has to 'step into the footlights'  as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids  a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous  but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man's inner torment.<br /><br />So while the drama is of the decline of Finney's Sir  a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the 'fatal flaw' of Courtenay's gayness  and makes this a film about him  as the title suggests.<br /><br />The art direction  pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time  more distant than the eighties and  in some ways  even than the second world war. The implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order  and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order  of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre; and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant  for all its flaws.,positive
One night I was listening to talk radio and they had Leslie Nielsen on the program. He went on to explain why there were only 6 shows. '<br /><br />With TV shows like MASH you could go to the fridge to get a beer and as long as you heard what was going on you didn't miss anything. But with Police Squad  you HAD to watch the show  with the sight gags you missed a whole lot if you didn't see them. Who could forget ... the part of town known as Little Italy... with the coliseum in the background.<br /><br />Even the movies relied heavily on the sight gags  but then again being in the theater you were a captive audience.<br /><br />Leslie also said the one reason the show  movies and other movies like Airplane were funny is because they didn't attempt to tell what was funny. It was up to the viewer to get the jokes.<br /><br />Well that's just my 2 cents.,positive
To be brief  the story is paper thin and you can see the ending coming from a mile away  but Gene Kelly  Rita Hayworth  and an impossibly young Phil Silvers keep the movie afloat throughout and at times lift it right up into the air. A few of the songs are terrible clunkers (Poor John is a train wreck) but most of them are great fun  and the scene of Hayworth performing on the absurdly huge set for Kelly's rival has to be seen to be believed. Another treat is the perfect faux-NYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition.<br /><br />Another attraction  if you consider such things attractions  is the howlingly awful male chivalry toward women. The oily leering and transparent obsequiousness that passed for male charm back then (in the movies  at least) is presented in its most lurid form here. Some of the men are about like a cartoon wolf.<br /><br />One minor disappointment is Eve Arden trapped in a role so minor that she barely has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interplay between her and Silvers--a missed opportunity.,positive
Anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will love<br /><br />this film. Taken from Ronald 'Taking Sides' Harwood  it's a funny<br /><br />and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two<br /><br />very 'actorly' types. Albert Finney is sublime as the despotic<br /><br />Shakespearean actor who barely notices the world war raging<br /><br />around him  so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatre<br /><br />company and his own psychological and emotional breakdown.<br /><br />Tom Courtenay is matchless as Norman  the 'Dresser' of the title <br /><br />whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless.<br /><br />Really a must see.,positive
The most notable feature of this film is the chemistry between the actors  the sense of camaraderie in their dialogue and dances. This typical rising-star musical has an overworked plot  even for 1944  but because of the actors it's still fun to watch. Hayworth isn't even that much of a dancer  but she has a lot of 'inexperienced' charm that fits her character. Kelly plays his usual caring authoritarian role while Silvers provides plenty of self-deprecation and laughs. The movie can also be very serious at times. Not a must-see  but recommended if you like the actors.,positive
Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired  it does serve well enough as an anchor for the Kern and Gershwin musical numbers. Following her signature role in Gilda  Hayworth opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her. Besides looking as gorgeous as ever  she impresses with her dancing as well. Gene Kelly  who was on loan to Columbia from MGM  matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done. The supporting characters were also competently acted. Personally  I didn't enjoy Cover Girl as much as the musicals Hayworth made with Fred Astaire. However  Cover Girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend. My score: 7/10.,positive
I'm not a big fan of musicals  but I was always enamored of Ms. Hayworth's looks  so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />This may be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms. Hayworth. She's never looked lovelier in a film (with the possible exception of 'Gilda'  where she is sex symbol par excellence).<br /><br />Rita is more than ably assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy may be dated  but it is still quite amusing. Kelly does one of his tour-de-force dances  dancing with the image of himself from a window.<br /><br />But Rita drives this whole movie. An excellent cast  featuring Otto Kruger and the always- wonderful  wise-cracking Eve Arden doesn't hurt.<br /><br />Rita sings  Rita dances  all the while looking impossibly beautiful! The music may be short of classic  but the lyrics to most of the tunes are quite clever.<br /><br />I find this movie works better than 'Gilda'  which I regard as a flawed film. To Ms. Hayworth's credit  she also drives 'Gilda'  and Gilda drives any red-blooded male insane.<br /><br />The film holds up well after all these years. Much leg candy for the male audience is a nice bonus!,positive
Although I'm not crazy about musicals  COVER GIRL is a delight for classic movie buffs and especially for fans of Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly. The film may be dated by today's standards and the story and songs may be nothing special  but the musical numbers are magnificently staged and there's a terrific cast to go with the film. Plus  the film is a worthy introduction for fans of Rita Hayworth...she's simply breathtaking in glorious Technicolor.<br /><br />Despite Jerome Kern's collaboration with the film  his music here is nowhere near as special or memorable as his songs in SWING TIME (1936)  yet the songs serve the film well. The dancing is nothing short of excellent  especially coming from Gene Kelly's solo number and my favorite musical number  Alter-Ego Dance. The amusing Phil Silvers nearly steals the film as Kelly's partner. Otto Kruger  Eve Arden  and Edward Brophy give good performances in their dramatic supporting roles. And Rita plays a sweet  charming girl here; a role that's a far cry from her femme fatale babes in films like BLOOD AND SAND (1941).<br /><br />All in all  this is a delightful film that's worth watching even if you're not big on musicals. Yet the film's music could have been more memorable if only my favorite period songwriters  Irving Berlin or Cole Porter  wrote the songs for this film. However  it's the glorious Technicolor cinematography and the imaginative dancing that are the real treats of the film's production.<br /><br />While I was watching Rita Hayworth do her stuff  I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful or graceful redhead dance on the screen since I saw Moira Shearer in Michael Powell's masterpiece  THE RED SHOES (1948). Just watch Rita in COVER GIRL and fall in love with her.,positive
Though I strongly feel that SITR is the best Gene Kelly movie  but this a pretty good one. I liked the music and the dancing and the ending on how Gene got the girl. My favorite part though without a doubt is Gene's dance with his alter ego. I love watching two Gene Kelly's for the price of one. It shows what talent Mr. Kelly really was. It is a movie that I think that everyone should watch at least once in their life time. So you have not seen it go out and find to watch it today! I'm sure that everyone out there has a Gene Kelly friend that has this movie in their collection. So go over to their house and pop some popcorn and enjoy!,positive
This was Gene Kelly's breakthrough  and that alone makes it memorable. Throw in Rita Hayworth as his love interest and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd pleaser  which is exactly how it turned out.<br /><br />Kelly plays Danny McGuire  a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the wrong side of the tracks in '40s films) whose star attraction and love interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is lovely  and even plays a dual role as Rusty and Rusty's grandmother. Rusty has a chance at the big time through the machinations of John Coudair (Otto Kruger)  who romanced and lost Rusty's grandmother.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Danny cutting Rusty loose  to the detriment of his club  because she has a chance at success that he can't give her. But  naturally  that's not what Rusty ultimately wants  because  as usual in films of that time  the right guy is the only thing on the girl's mind. There are no surprises  but everybody does their thing well.<br /><br />Kelly does the first of his amazing trick dances  this time with himself as a reflection from a glass window. He was the master at that sort of dance  and one still has to wonder how they timed everything so precisely so that he really does seem to be in two places at once. The melodrama gets a bit thick  and there are some gratuitous war references thrown in that do little but provide the opportunity for a song or two  but Kelly takes this film to the next level. This was before he became a mega-star and too smooth perhaps for his own good. An underlying edge of rawness to his character lends it a believable and almost wistful air.<br /><br />Kelly's character in the 1980 Xanadu also was named Danny McGuire. This film was the beginning  that film the end  of a terrific run for a dancing genius. Clearly  this film meant a lot to him. Highly recommended.,positive
Another great musical from Hollywoods Golden Age! I liked this movies story about a trio of friends who are performers at a small nightclub that is far from Broadway and all its glitter. Although not the big time they are very content with their lives and the small club where they perform. Gene Kelly plays the owner of the small club and is also the boyfriend of one of its dancers  Rita Hayworth who happens to garner some attention when she's given an opportunity to be on a cover of a magazine. Trouble begins for Gene Kelly as his girlfriend is now the talk of the town. Phil Silvers plays one of the three friends and does a good job. Of course there is the music and the dancing. One dance performance by Gene Kelly stands out. He is walking along the street at night alone and he see his reflection in a shop window. His reflection soon starts dancing along with him in the streets  great cinematography. Don't miss this one  great entertainment.,positive
Long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and Cover Girl is no exception to the rule.<br /><br />A story of a dancer in a nightclub who becomes a cover girl and famous. The old adage applies here- that happiness and fame always don't mix.<br /><br />The dance routines are marvelously choreographed. What dancing and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly.<br /><br />Otto Kruger is the older gentleman who discovers Hayworth  when he sees her picture that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at the aisle-Hayworth's grandmother Maribel.<br /><br />A jealous reaction by Kelly drives Rusty (Hayworth) into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowman.<br /><br />The picture is basically history repeating itself at the end.<br /><br />To add to the glory of this fine film  there is the always wise-cracking Eve Arden and the hilarious Phil Silvers  appropriately named Genius in the film.,positive
One of my favorites non-MGM musicals  it's a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form  her beauty leaps out of the screen. Gene Kelly shows off his dancing skills and introduces to musicals his edgy and innovative choreography that eventually would change the way musicals are choreograph. Phil Silvers is the perfect second bananas  and Eve Arden injects this movie with a lot of class.<br /><br /> The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why  in this era where major Broadway shows come from the movies  Cover Girl hasn't been adapted to theatre.,positive
In Brooklyn  the nightclub dancer Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) has a simple but happy life dancing in the McGuire's  owned by her boyfriend Danny (Gene Kelly). Rusty  Danny and Genius (Phil Silvers) have a ritual on Friday nights: they order oysters in a bar  trying to find a pearl. The life of Rusty changes when she participates and wins a contest to be the cover page of the Vanity magazine. She is invited to work in a huge theater in Broadway  whose owner proposes her. She loses her happiness and starts drinking in her new life style  missing the love of Danny and her old friends. 'Cover Girl' is a delightful romantic comedy  very naive and having magnificent parts  such as the beauty and talented Rita Hayworth dancing  singing and acting; Gene Kelly  specially in two scenes  dancing with himself and with Rusty and Genius on the street; the songs and the choreography of the dances are also spectaculars. Danny  the character of Gene Kelly  is almost nasty with his chauvinist behavior. Rita Hayworth surprised me with her talent: I found her amazing in 'Gilda'  but she is stunning in 'Cover Girl'. In accordance with the information on the cover of the VHS  'Cover Girl' was the first musical where the songs were part of the plot  giving continuity to the story  instead of just being 'thrown' in the movie. My sixteen years old son saw this movie with a friend of the same age in a recent Gene Kelly festival and they loved 'Cover Girl'  therefore I dare to say that this classic is recommended to any movie lover and not only to the old generations. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): 'Modelos' ('Models'),positive
Sir has played Lear over 200 times but tonight he can't remember his opening lines.Sitting at the mirror his eyes reflect the King's madness. His dresser prompts him gently mouthing the words.There is an air of desperation about both these men.The great actor knowing his powers are slipping away his valet cum major domo cum conscience cum surrogate wife - aware of his boss's decline into madness and knowing he is powerless to do more than ease his passing. The Dresser is really a love story between the two.Over the years they have become mutually dependent on one another to the extent that neither can conceive a future without the other. Set during the second world war it concerns the fortunes of a frankly second - rate touring Shakespearean Company comprising an equal number of has - beens and wannabes led by Sir  a theatrical knight of what might kindly be called The Old School.Whatever part he is playing he grabs centre - stage and bellows out over the footlights bullying his audience into applause.But somewhere inside him buried most of the time deep beneath the ham he regularly dishes out there still remains an occasional glitter of his earlier greatness.It is to catch a glimpse of this that his audiences fervently hope for. Mr A.Finney very cleverly concentrates on the ham often to the point of caricature and just when you are ready to dismiss his performance as mere hyperbole and bluster he will produce a moment of exquisite subtlety and vulnerability that makes you realise that a great actor is playing a great actor. The same goes for Mr T.Courtenay.It's easy to write off his portrayal<br /><br />of Norman as an exercise in stereotyping.Here we have a middle - aged effeminate rather than camp theatrical dresser sashaying his way through life enjoying the company of The Girls and loving the wicked Insider gossip rife in The Theatre.There were - and I strongly suspect still are - many men just like Norman in The Profession.Infinitely kind and patient knowing more about the plays than many of the actors they run backstage with wisdom and affection.I believe the vast majority of them would hoot with approving laughter at Mr Courtenay's portrait. I saw The Dresser on the London stage where against the perceived wisdom Mr Courtenay's Norman was rather more subdued than in the movie.Sir was played by the great Mr Freddie Jones to huge acclaim from the audience.It was a memorable performance that overshadowed Mr Courtenay's reducing him rather to an also - ran as opposed to an actor on level - billing.The idea that Sir and Norman might be almost incomplete without each other went right out of the window. Norman was reduced to being his puppet which I'm not sure was what Ronald Harwood intended but made for breathtaking theatre. Messrs Finney and Courtenay redress the balance in the movie restoring equality to the relationship. Both men have come a long way since their early appearances in the British New Wave pictures when they became the darlings of the vaguely Leftish middle - class and ashamed of it movement.When the British cinema virtually committed Hari - kiri in the 1970s they quietly concentrated on the theatre apart from a few roles to keep the wolf from the door.With the renaissance of more substantial movies they re - appeared blinking in the unaccustomed bright light.<br /><br />The Dresser marked their return still fizzing with energy and talent  shouting to the world at large We're still here.It's not a big movie but is assuredly a great one.,positive
Rita Hayworth lights up the screen in this fun  fancy and delightful musical starring Gene Kelly. Rita plays nightclub dancer Rusty Parker who has dreams to be a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately  her career is getting no where in Danny McGuire's Night Club. When one of her fellow dancers says she's going to enter a Cover Girl contest  she decides to follow her dreams and enters. She reminds the publisher of her Grandma  who he was deeply in love with many years ago. But when she finds this success  her boyfriend is not happy about it.<br /><br />I had never seen Rita before this  and I am so glad I did! She has such a scene presence and is a very good actress. There are some good numbers in here  not the best of any musical but they are melodic and good to listen to. One thing I didn't like was Gene Kelly's character. He should have supported his girlfriend! But anyway  that's perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie. Cover Girl is a glorious  fluffy film - perfect escapism. Not everyone's ideal movie  but a wonderful movie nonetheless  due to Rita Hayworth's star power. Great movie  truly impressed.,positive
I really like this film because of all the stars and the dancing and the story that goes along with it. Rita Hayworth was at her most glamorous in this musical and the costumes were gorgeous. Although a musical  I thought Rita Hayworth did a fine performance of dramatic acting in this film as well. As far as her dancing  I think she was excellent. Even Betty Grable pretty much endorsed Rita's dancing in this film as she commented that Rita danced rings around her own dancing and let's face it  Betty Grable was an excellent dancer. The cinematography and vivid colors are also noted. Rita wants to be a cover girl for a magazine but she's also in love with her mentor played by Gene Kelly. Does she leave Kelly to fulfill her dream and bypass love and Broadway stardom or does she stick around to find that unique pearl that will change her life forever? You'll have to watch the film to find out!,positive
A fantastic musical starring Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth. He owns a nightclub where she dances. She's no star yet  but she gets a big break when she's chosen as a cover girl for Vanity  whose owner was actually in love with her grandmother. When he sees the resemblance  he picks her right away for a contest his maganzine is running. Hayworth's newfound fame at first works wonders for Kelly's club  but her star rises so quickly and so high up that his grasp on her begins to falter. This isn't the most original of plots  but the two leads really make it work. It also helps that the screenplay is great. Kelly's not yet at his peak  especially his peak as an actor. His dancing  however  wow. Hayworth is the star  but Kelly claims the film's most memorable moment as he dances passionately with his own reflection. It's obviously a take-off of Fred Astaire's shadow dancing in Swing Time  but I think Kelly one-ups it  which is hardly believable. In fact  this has got to be the most amazing dance sequence in film history  save perhaps the finale of An American in Paris several years later. The rest of the songs are also excellent  and the musical numbers are even better. Too bad Rita didn't sing her own songs (well  she may have a couple of them  as her singing voice seemed to be different sometimes). Her dancing is wonderful  as is the rest of her acting. It's hard not to love her in anything. She's really one of the few truly beautiful women from the classic era. Not plastic like many of them; no  you can really see the warmth in that woman. Her smile is so disarming. Phil Silvers has the role as Kelly's best friend  and he is also very funny. The trio of Kelly-Hayworth-Silvers is obviously the kernel which became the Kelly-Reynolds-O'Connor trio in Singin' in the Rain eight years afterwards. One of the biggest musical numbers in the film seems almost completely pilfered with the Good Morning number in Singin'. I do think Singin' in the Rain is the better film  as Cover Girl is a little rough around the edges. This roughness  though  just adds to the charm. There are aspects of this film that beat Singin' in the Rain  and even An American in Paris. For instance  the central relationship is more emotionally involving. Instead of the dominant older man chasing the little girl (Leslie Caron and Debbie Reynolds were just teenagers  after all)  we have a very nice relationship with two people who seem more like equals. There is no chasing around - an aspect that does unfortunately turn a lot of the best musicals a little sour  you have to admit. Kelly and Hayworth are a couple from the start  and when that begins to fray  I really felt it. 9/10.,positive
This has got to be one of the better post-Astaire musicals made by Columbia. Produced by Arthur Schwartz and directed by vet Charles Vidor  this picture really put Gene Kelly on the map and cemented Rita Hayworth's reputation as cinema's premier female dance partner. She plays a bit of a dual role here since she performs contemporary 1940s numbers with Gene and co-star Phil Silvers  but also puts her in the role of her grandmother  a nightclub performer in the late 19th Centry.<br /><br />The music should also be singled out because this was I believe the last project that the legendary Jerome Kern (most famous today for Old Man River and Smoke Gets in Your Eyes) worked on  and his lyricist was the equally legendary Ira Gershwin. They supplied a score that is full of charm and characterization. The music for the historical sequences is especially noteworthy because it's so perfectly styled in the early 20th Century idiom that was Kern's original period. It's a bit like picking up a record from one of your favorite bands from the 1970s and hearing them do a song in the original style of that time.<br /><br />The story is pretty inconsequential  which is fine with me because this film is as close an approximation as you will ever be likely to see of the 1930s/40s golden age of Broadway musical comedy style on film. Even the 1940s war propaganda aspects of the film's music give it extra charm as the talented trio sing make way for tomorrow and even humorously poke fun at America's enemies and use period slang such as referring to gremlins.<br /><br />Probably the most memorable performance in the film is Kelly's dance to the Alter-Ego Dance  which found him arguing with and then dancing with himself as a metaphorical image of the battle of the conscience. This prefigures much of his later work and also stands an effective and memorable scene in and of itself.<br /><br />Fans will want to seek this out for various reasons -- Kelly fans will see this as a rare chance to see him outside of the confines of MGM with a different set of co-stars and music superior to his usual MGM material. Hayworth fans will want to see Rita in glorious color at the peak of her fame and ability. And fans of classic Broadway musicals will definitely want to hear Kern's final score and marvel at the quality of Gershwin's lyrics and the compatibility of their styles. This is a definite gem in the crown of Columbia's musical program.,positive
Rita Hayworth is right there where she should be - as a Cover Girl in this 1944 Technicolor film also starring Gene Kelly  Phil Silvers  Eve Arden  Lee Bowman  and Otto Kruger. Rita plays a beautiful showgirl  Rusty  working at a small club owned by the man she loves  Danny (Kelly). Each Friday they go out for oysters with Genius (Silvers)  the club comedian. They all hate oysters  but they're looking for a pearl. When they find one  all three of them will have good luck  they believe.<br /><br />Rusty auditions and wins the role of cover girl for a magazine - she starts off ahead of the other contestants because the magazine owner (Kruger) sees a resemblance between Rusty and the girl he once loved  who turns out to be Rusty's grandmother. Once she becomes the cover girl  the world opens up for her and her dreams of appearing on Broadway come true. Danny wants her to have her success  but at the same time realizes he's lost her.<br /><br />Cover Girl has exuberant dance numbers and songs by Jerome Kern  with Rita dubbed by Martha Mears. Rita is at her best playing both Rusty in the present and her grandmother in the past. For such a sexy  desirable  gorgeous woman  she was apparently very insecure and always under the thumb of domineering men. None of this ever showed on screen  nor did the fact that she didn't want to be a movie star. She is one of the true goddesses and brought everything she did to life. Gene Kelly is in a serious role here  but gets plenty of chances to dance and sing. Phil Silvers is very amiable and funny as the in-house comic and best friend.<br /><br />This is a very good movie with no dull spots. The only problem I had is the idea that Rusty has to choose between a successful career and the man she loves. When supermodel Jinx Falkenberg  who plays herself in the film  speaks of getting married  she's warned by her boss not to  that she's too necessary to the modeling business. We're not told if Rusty continues with her career or goes back to work at Danny's - but all signs seemed to point toward the Brooklyn club. Why couldn't she have had both? Nevertheless  you can't beat Cover Girl for top entertainment  beautiful color  lovely music  great energy  fine performances  and its most fabulous asset  the glorious Rita Hayworth.,positive
This is one of the best musicals of the 1940s. The glorious Technicolor shows off Rita Hayworth's beauty and spectacular hair. She should have made more movies in color  but then Columbia was hardly in a position to splash out money for Technicolor spectaculars.<br /><br />Rita is a WOW as Rusty Parker - she more than keeps up with Gene in some of the most sparkling numbers ever. She also looked beautiful in turn of the century gowns  so she was given a chance to play her own grandmother.<br /><br />The film opens with The Show Must Go On - it looks great to me - but Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed. His motto is work  work  work!!! One of the dancers  Maurine (Lesley Brookes) is determined to better herself and is going to audition for Vanity's Golden Wedding Cover Girl Competition. Rusty just happens to find herself at the auditions as well. In a very funny scene Maurine has just had a so so audition and seeing Rusty  gives her a few tips on how to impress the judges!!! Don't be shy and demure - chatter and sparkle. Rusty does so with gusto!!!<br /><br />They decide on Maurine and go to the show to see her but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past. Cornelia (Eve Arden) is still having nightmares over Rusty's audition. Whose Complaining features Genius (Phil Silvers) and the dancers  dressed up as working girls - (Rusty is a cabbie).<br /><br />John is remembering a long lost love (Rusty's grandmother  Maribelle Hicks) the first time he saw her singing A Sure Thing - set at the races. Meanwhile Danny  Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls at their local diner. They then launch into the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) - Make Way For Tomorrow.<br /><br />Put Me to the Test is a spirited song and dance number featuring Danny and Rusty. In the meantime Rusty has been chosen Cover Girl and Danny McGuires' is the place to be seen. Lee Bowman appears as Danny's romantic rival and puts a damper on things. Lee Bowman is probably the most boring leading man ever - so Danny never needs to worry.<br /><br />Rusty (dubbed by Martha Mears) sings Long Ago and Far Away and it is danced beautifully by Danny and Rusty. The gowns that Rita wears are stunning. Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling designed them. Danny wants the best for Rusty but is afraid he will lose her. Gene Kelly is also fantastic in the Alter Ego number where he dances with himself.<br /><br />Poor John is another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely funny song poking fun at rich relations - Hayworth looks gorgeous in an amazingly quaint outfit. Look for Al Norman in both Poor John and A Sure Thing. He was an amazing eccentric dancer  who appeared in several early musicals  including King of Jazz and Paramount on Parade. He was easy to spot.<br /><br />The Cover Girl dance is just wonderful. Rita was so talented - beautiful and a great dancer. After a bevy of beautiful models parade through covers of America's top magazines  Rusty bursts through in a beautiful gold gown dancing down a ramp to the very catchy Cover Girl song. Gosh I just LOVE this movie!!!!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.,positive
This is a very enjoyable  fluffy  glamorous musical from the 40's. 'Cover Girl' made Rita Hayworth (formerly the dark-haired Latin senorita Margarita Cansino) into a bona-fide  all-American star. It confirmed Gene Kelly's amazing talent as a dancer  singer  actor and choreographer. It epitomises the exuberance and colour of the musical genre.<br /><br />Rita Hayworth is great as Rusty Parker- it is her picture  and her presence is always at the forefront. Her singing is dubbed  but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with Kelly. I think that Rita was highly underrated as an actress- she plays every scene superbly here. Gene choreographed the dance sequences (he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here)  and his 'Alter Ego' dance number is amazing. Such artistry. The stand-out tunes are 'Make Way For Tomorrow'  'Put Me To The Test'  and  of course  'Long Ago and Far Away'. The plot is rather thin  yet it does have a moral. It's about the perils of quick fame and fast money  and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed. This will cheer you up  lift you up to your feet and make you laugh.<br /><br />That said  'Cover Girl' is not the greatest musical ever produced- it has a number of flaws that must be addressed. One can say that a little bit of Phil Silvers goes a long way. His character gets tedious rather quickly. However  I was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with Gene and Rita. Another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great. The 'Cover Girl' number looks fantastic  but I'm not a fan of the lyrics or the singing. 'Poor Tom' is a huge downer. I think it's one of the worst numbers I've heard in a 40's-50's musical yet. It stinks. The grandmother sub-plot borders on being ridiculous. But that's only my opinion. Others may like these elements.<br /><br />Still  apart from it's faults it's a very  very good film  much better than most of the product churned out today. The dancing and singing is sublime  the production values are excellent  and it's mood is infectious.<br /><br />8/10.,positive
This is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of Charles Vidor. Rita Hayworth  (Rusty Parker) Charlie Chan in Egypt  sang and danced with Gene Kelly (Danny McGuire)  Anchors Away  Danny McGuire owned a night club in Brooklyn  N.Y. and was in love with Rusty Parker who was a dancer in his club along with Phil Silvers (Genius) Coney Island  who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with Danny  Rusty. Otto Kruger  (John Coudair) Duel in the Sun played the role as a promoter of a cover girl magazine and decided Rusty Parker was going to be his top model. Jerome Kern's music is heard through out the entire picture and the song  Long Ago & Far Away is the theme music for this musical. This film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during WW II which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were instant hits and their career's exploded on the silver screen for many many years. Great Musical and a film you will not want to miss  this is truly a great Classic Film. Enjoy,positive
Rita Hayworth as Rusty Parker is the COVER GIRL du jour--she's one of the dancing girls in Danny McGuire's club  the most special one according to Danny (Gene Kelly) and pretty much anyone who comes across her. Take for example  Vanity magazine magnate John Coudair (Otto Kruger): enchanted by Rusty's resemblance to her grandmother Maribelle (also played by Hayworth in flashbacks)  whom he wooed devotedly when he fell in love with her  he tries to relive his youth by fixing what he thinks went wrong between himself and Maribelle. He doesn't believe that Danny could give Rusty happiness  or everything she should be entitled to--he even gets Danny believing this himself. When Rusty shoots to fame as Vanity's 'Cover Girl'  Danny drives her away into the ready and waiting arms of Noel Wheaton (Lee Bowman). So what happens when Danny returns to town with his sidekick Genius (Phil Silvers) in tow  only to discover that Rusty is marrying Wheaton?<br /><br />As a musical  COVER GIRL benefits from the beautiful score and songs written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin  including the Oscar-nominated 'Long Ago and Far Away' (possibly one of the most gorgeous ballads ever written and beautifully  sweetly sung as a duet by Hayworth and Kelly)  Maribelle's number 'Sure Thing' (the more lacklustre 'Poor John' isn't a Kern/Gershwin collaboration) and 'Put Me To The Test'. The dancing  of course  is top-notch  since Gene Kelly had more than just a hand in the choreography. It shows in the simplest of dances  for example his dance with Hayworth to 'Put Me To The Test'  or the joyfully exuberant 'Make Way For Tomorrow' number (performed by the trio of Danny  Rusty and Genius)... which foreshadows the reaction Gene's character has to the police cop in the title number in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. Kelly especially scored a technological and artistic coup with the 'Alter-Ego' dance. Like its successors in ANCHORS AWEIGH and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS (Jerry the Mouse and the 16-minute ballet respectively)  this dance is an example of the incredible innovation and creativity Kelly brought to the modern film musical: wanting to use the film medium to present dances that couldn't be showcased on a stage  and years before CGI  Kelly insisted on dancing with the one person who could possibly match him in talent and style--himself. The number is hardly five minutes long  but it (and Kelly's genius) still takes one's breath away  even sixty years down the line. This is the reason I watched COVER GIRL  and if nothing else  this dance is truly worth it.<br /><br />You can tell that a great deal of money was lavished onto COVER GIRL and Rita Hayworth--not that she doesn't deserve it. Witness the scene when Rusty hits Broadway--the large screen showcasing all the different cover girls gives way to a staggeringly large stage rigged for Rusty's entrance. Hayworth is indeed one of the most effortlessly beautiful girls on show in the film  and she dances with a style and grace that is almost worthy of Kelly. (Very few of Kelly's co-stars have that honour.) She is hilarious in some scenes  for example her drunk scene when John and Wheaton come to get her from Joe's.<br /><br />For some reason  however  her performance still lacks the spark of greatness which would help COVER GIRL overcome its general curse of mediocrity. That curse is only lifted whenever Gene Kelly is on the screen (dancing or no)  or when Eve Arden as John's long-suffering secretary 'Stonewall' sidles by with another cutting comment or clever observation. Since the film  in the end  belongs to Hayworth  neither Kelly nor Arden can save it as a whole. This isn't to say that the film is bad--it isn't. It's enjoyable  with great songs and cute numbers and lots of pretty girls to look at. But it's just not quite a classic. The dancing is classic though--so watch COVER GIRL for that  and you won't regret it.,positive
Cover Girl is the best musical Rita Hayworth ever made. Ms. Hayworth will always be remembered for Gilda  however  the next movie would be Cover Girl. The story is great. It is about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in show business. She does it without the help of her talented dancer/director boyfriend (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly is given the chance to choreograph the musical numbers. The dances are spectacular. It is fun to see Phil Silvers  a comic  do the musical numbers with Ms. Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /><br />The supporting cast is perfect. Lee Bowman is given a chance to be an interesting third wheel  the other boyfriend.,positive
This is a movie that deserves another look--if you haven't seen it for a while  or a first look--if you were too young when it came out (1983). Based on a play by the same name  it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring Shakespearean repertory company in England during World War II. It deals with his stress of trying to perform a Shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors--the young  able bodied ones being taken for military service. It also deals with his relationship with various members of his company  especially with his dresser. So far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth. While tragic overall  the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout. The two male leads both received Oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama  theater--especially Shakespeare  or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity. The backstage goings-on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers.,positive
A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on broadway which means she would have to leave the small dinner theater where she works with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local bar where they get oysters so they can look for a pearl (they never eat them). The story line provides numerous opportunities for songs and dancing. The movie has two questions that Rusty must answer: Is fame all that it is cracked up to be? and Is less really more if you are happy? Answering those questions makes the movie. The movie also does a good job of showcasing the talents that all three principals had. Never a dull moment!,positive
It took a loan out film to Columbia for Gene Kelly's home studio MGM to realize his creative talent and give him some control over what he did in his own films. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II.<br /><br />Kelly plays the owner of a small nightclub in Brooklyn where Rita is a featured dancer and Phil Silvers the comic. Of course Kelly does a bit of hoofing himself there.<br /><br />Hayworth comes to the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger when it turns out that Kruger had loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother. In some flashback sequences from the gaslight era  Hayworth also plays her own grandmother with Jess Barker playing the young Kruger. You might remember Jess Barker was the husband of that other legendary screen redhead  Susan Hayward.<br /><br />Broadway producer Lee Bowman also is attracted to Hayward  but he's not interested in nostalgia. He wants her for his Ziegfeld Follies revue and in fact the biggest number of Cover Girl is the title song of the film. It's nicely done in Follies style.<br /><br />Hayworth also gets to sing A Sure Thing in a gaslight era number and in the only song in the show not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin  Hayworth also does an old English music hall number Poor John. When I say sing  as everyone knows Rita mouths words. Singing here is done by Nan Wynn.<br /><br />The biggest hit of the show is Long Ago and Far Away which is introduced by Gene Kelly. It was one of the biggest hits of the World War II era and one of the biggest sellers Jerome Kern ever wrote. It happens in fact to be a favorite of an aunt of mine who with my uncle will be celebrating 60 years of marriage this September. Long Ago and Far Away was nominated for Best Song  but lost to Swinging on a Star.<br /><br />What really sets Cover Girl apart and what makes it a milestone film for Gene Kelly is the two numbers Put Me to the Test and the Alter Ego number. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Mayer had refused at MGM  to give Kelly creative control of his own material. Kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever attempted in his career. In it he dances with a pale reflection of himself and the choreography is dazzling and intricate. <br /><br />In fact after one more loan out film  Christmas Holiday at Universal  Louis B. Mayer never loaned out Gene Kelly for the rest of the time he was at MGM. And he did get creative control from then on.<br /><br />With that dazzling technicolor cinematography and Rita's red hair and Gene Kelly's boundless creativity  Cover Girl was and is a classic and will forever be so.,positive
When I saw this film  it reminded me of all the greatest dreams i had (mostly filled with robots)<br /><br />I can relate to Eledore's problems and I have a similarity to Shiro  and this is a great film to watch (if you're a Goth who is bitter and eccentric like me!). All in all  watch it before it's out of print!,positive
I just re-watched 08th MS Gundam for the 2nd time. It is so much better than Gundam Wing. I can't wait to get the DVD and see what was edited out of the series. This is great to see the Gundams actually move about clumsily through the land. Somebody really thought over writing this move script.<br /><br />See this today .,positive
The 08th MS team features two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict. Aina  the Zeon officer  and Shiro  the Federal Forces' new pilot  meet in a battle in space  throughout the 12 episode series (and one movie) the two debate their love for each other while trying to come to grips with the war that surrounds them. It features a Romeo and Juliet romance and unbeatable animation. By far one of the best to hit American Shores. Suit Up!,positive
This Gundam series only follows Gundam 0083 Stardust Memory. The story takes place during the same time line as the original Gundam in the year U.C. 0079 the time of the One year war  but the mobile suits are designed as new models are and are as a result look more articulate. The Hero of the story is a young Lt. Shiro Amada  who may lack any real combat experience but makes up for it with creativity and effort.<br /><br />His life get complicated when he meets Aina Sahalin a Jion ace pilot (the enemy)  the to end up falling in love and begin to change their attitudes about the war around them. The other cast of characters in the story are not there for background either  every one in this story has a history to them.<br /><br />There is also another Ace mobile suit pilot in this series that can be added into the pantheon of ace mobile suit pilots. Right up there with Char Aznable and Anavel Gato is Norris Packard  not the top villain in this series  but his presence give the 8th mobile suit team a hard fight. 3 of them against Norris and his single MS-07B Gouf custom mobile suit.<br /><br />In conclusion This Gundam along with Stardust Memory is a must see!!<br /><br />,positive
Watched this film at a local festival  the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida . What a lovely film. A simple  uncomplicated morality tale about a young care free young man having to take responsibility for his actions. It neither pretentious or flashy my two teenage daughters loved it and for a change I wasn't embarrassed by any of the film content or language. A real family film and the best British comedy film I've seen since Billy Elliot.The film went on to win not surprisingly the top festival awards of Best Film and Best Director. Ten out of ten.,positive
Logged on to the imdb to say what a charming film Love Love is and am totally confused. Seems to me that someone has been getting their titles mixed up. Plastic demon baby what? This wasn't Love Life. A little bit luvy dovey for my tastes but a great  funny and original film. Especially liked the ending that didn't fall into the normal pit of cliche that all hollywood romantic films crash and burn it. Nine out of ten.,positive
I watched Love Life on holiday  when it was filmed at a film festival in Florida. It was a lovely surprise to find a British film that wasn't derivative or exploitive. A beautiful romantic comedy for a change that will charm the pants of audiences prepared to sit back and enjoy the gentle pace of the film. The transitions between scenes I found a bit distracting  but as whole I think Love Life is a winner  a ruby in the dust. One for all the family. A pleasant change to see a British film for teen audiences that isn't littered with four letter words. Try and see it.,positive
Wow! Why aren't more British movies like this. Great rights of passage money with a big heart and some stand out performances. The comedy is quirky and original and the kid is really great. One to hunt down and watch. Look out for it! Ten out of ten.,positive
This film has its detractors  and Courtney's fey dresser may offend some folks (who  frankly  need a good smack upside the head) -- but the film is top notch in every way: engaging  poignant  relevant. Finney  naturally  is larger than life. Courtney makes an ideal foil. I thought the performances to be terribly strong in both leads  and Courtney's character provides plenty of dark humor. The period is well captured  the supporting cast well chosen. This is to be seen and savored like a fine cordial. I only wish it were out on DVD already...(*sigh*)...,positive
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart. It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent. Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.,positive
It's just one of those films  you're either love it or hate it  my girlfriend and me loved it  told my brother to rent it and he hated it  said it was too flashy and colloquial  then again he only usually goes to see big action movies  so probably not enough explosions left him disappointed. There were some great new talent (I'd never heard of the leads before anyway)? Des Brady (the directors brother?) was especially good. Playing a right dick at the start I thought he never would redeem himself but he managed to crawl out of the dark hole he had created and by the end I was really routing for him. A very surprising film with a whole lot of heart  if you can live without a body count and explosions then this one is very original. Yashimo. Brixton in the UK.,positive
We really liked this movie. It wasn't trying to be outrageous  controversial  clever or profound. It was just entertaining and was what it said on the box a charming romantic comedy. Every other Brit film maker seems to want to change the world  nice to see one that just concentrates on telling a good yarn with elegant style.,positive
Rented this out from my local because it was the only new British film available this week. Never heard of the film-maker before or his other films (thank you IMDB). About time some one made a good young British comedy that didn't star Hugh Grant or forty something's. The story is a morality tale but never preachy  throughly enjoyable from a young and fresh faced cast. Luke Goss's cameo was surprisingly very good  but then he did surprise me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'. Loved the colour grading  especially in the night club sequences. Great music and a truly original voice at work here. Nine out of ten and well worth the rental charge.,positive
A vg Brit rom-com  one to watch if you can get your hands on a copy. Quirky and often surprising  this is not the best of Brady's films (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is by far the funniest)  though it does have a unique charm. Well written the story veers off into a few dead ends but mostly surfaces with a new plot high. You know from the start how it's going to end  but when it comes it is honest and very open ended  a realistic and credible ending  the end seemed like a beginning  enjoyable and left me wanting more.,positive
Inherited this from my x's DVD collection when he left with my best friend (enough said)  watched it one night when there was nothing on the telly (nothing new there then) and got a very pleasant surprise. Very British (you no hardly any budget  no faces you know or have even seen before)  the accents were a bit thick for my liking  but after a worrying start (a bit too close to home in my case) it began to grow on me. Apart from the some unnecessary jokey cutting that really didn't add anything  I found the film throughly uplifting  very real  natural performances throughout left me wanting more from an ending that came suddenly too soon. Highly recommended!,positive
After having seen The Lost Child for quite a number of times since its release in 1995  and having read the reader's comments (mostly about Jane Tennison's background and Helen Mirren's superb role in it)  it strikes me more than ever that no comments are made upon the brilliant role Robert Glenister is playing as Chris Hughes. Even after 10 years it is still one of the most credible ways of portraying the complex personality of a child abuser  carrying the weight of his own past.Watching the episode for the full one and a half hour makes you constantly switch between feelings of love and hate for this guy  in which the hate prevails because of the gravity of his actions. I have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor  but this one never fails to make the largest impression possible to me. Helen Mirren would never shine without these wonderful actors next to her. Praise for Robert Glenister!,positive
I'm surprised that mine  so far  is the only comment on this t.v. movie...as far as I'm aware  the series itself  has had a huge following  reviewer pundits and real people alike  have praised it to a person. Anyway  let me tell you right away that  if like me  you're a sucker for gritty police dramas  you'll like The Lost Child Tennison  the heroine  throughout the Prime Suspectseries  has been battling the male police establishment  throughout the series  getting to her present  comparatively powerful rank in the police hierarchy through hard work obstinacy  and sheer talent for police work. She is essentially  an ambitious career woman  but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man-hater. Unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours  which her career demands  and she has never married  so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair  she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother  and jeopardising her entire police job  let alone future advancement  or having an abortion - which she opts for. This abortion never looms large in the ensuing drama - it's very skilfully dealt with  in less than a couple of minutes screentime  a marvel of economy in scripting  and editing - but it's always there  as a counterpoint to Tennison's desperate efforts to find another lost child - a kidnap victim - before it's too late. The story takes many twists and turns before the surprise ending  and one is fascinated  alike  by the plot  and characters (although I found the many villains a little overdrawn)  the police  and especially Tennison  herself  are not always competent  nor that likeable  which figures  given the unpleasant job that they have to do  in the sleazy underworld which this series  habitually inhabits.<br /><br />Mirren  herself  has said that she'll make no more movies in the series  but  excellent as she's always been in the role of Tennison  the series  itself  is as actor proof as is another addiction of mine -Dick Wolf's AmericanLaw & Order - whoever appears therein  each could go on forever. As is my fervent hope.,positive
Prime Suspect 4 continues the exploits of the inscrutable and dogged seeker of truth and justice  Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4  PS5  & PS6) with the notable absence of founding writer Lynda La Plante from the credits. Imbued with the same gritty reality of the first three series  the second three series pit Tennison against the forces of evil while coping with middle age  loneliness  indiscretions  a host of personal and professional problems  and resolutions which are sometimes less than ideal. PS4 conjures two stories while PS5 & PS6 are single episodes each which find Tennison seeking justice on behalf of the brutally wronged while waging war against institutions which are willing to sacrifice the interests of her victims for those of a greater good. In other words  to prevail  Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces  something which makes the always gray scenarios of the PS series yet grayer and the Tennison wars as much a matter of principle as of finding murderers. Very good stuff which only gets better from series to series. (B+),positive
As the superb `Prime Suspect' series reaches part four there is no loss of momentum at all  this in itself a considerable achievement.' Prime Suspect IV: The Lost Child' has the solid supporting cast that we take for granted in these British dramas but of course the beautiful Helen Mirren easily dominates; our eyes never leave her while she's on-screen.<br /><br />The search for the lost child of the title leads Superintendent Jane Tennison's CID team to a prime suspect who turns out to be a convicted pedophile now living with a single mother and her two young daughters. The insight we are given into the workings of his mind is one of the emotional highlights of this mini-series but it may be too strong for many stomachs.<br /><br />The action sequences are brilliantly handled with the hand-held camera thrusting us right into the middle of the excitement and there's gripping tension during the climactic siege.<br /><br />Altogether this is another magnificent police procedural drama.,positive
The third entry in the Stepford franchise  but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down  whereas the 70's original as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular. I haven't seen either the early 80's Revenge of the Stepford Wives or the mid 90's The Stepford Husbands  but this The Stepford Children is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film. It's basically the exact same film as the original; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80's to the nth degree. The main difference here  like the title implies  is that not just the liberated wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergoes the typical and highly effective Stepford treatment  licensed by the local Men's Association. For some reason the scenario attempts to uphold the Stepford mystery until late in the film  even though nobody is likely to watch this sequel before having checked out the original and presumably everybody also knows about the denouement. The Harding family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford. Particularly father Steven is excited about their new life because he already lived in Stepford and always wanted to go back ever since his first wife  whom his new wife Laura and adolescent children Mary and David know very little about  died under mysterious circumstances. The town is almost too perfect  with picturesque neighbors and model students  and especially the modern teenagers face huge difficulties to adjust. Their efforts to modernize the place and take the local youth of Stanford in tow cause confrontations with the eminent townsfolk  particularly the members of the Men's Association  and put the familial relationships under a lot of stress. David meets and falls in love with the last normal girl in school Lois  but when even she transforms into a domestic dummy overnight  David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister Stanford secret. The first hour of The Stanford Children is slow-paced and rather tame  but the finale is trashy and cheesy like the VHS cover promises and like a late 80's thriller ought to be  in fact. The modus operandi behind the Stanford secrets is illustrated in greater detail  and I think horror fans and lovers of the original film will appreciate that. At least  I did. The overall plot still doesn't make a lot of sense and the script is chock-full of irrational aspects  but it's nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear. The acting performances are far above average. Especially the arrogant and obnoxious members of the Men's Association depict plausible characters and even teenage players Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff give away impressive performances. Recommended without hesitation!,positive
The Stepford Children  besides being a very good made for TV movie  shows the very disturbing result of indoctrination. It is quite a statement about how being made to act within the confines of what is considered Good behavior can destroy whatever it is that makes a person unique and an individual. I think that this is a movie that parents who want to maintain some semblance of the thought that loams within the hearts and minds of youngsters should watch with their children and discuss what the movie is saying. I don't know if that was in any way the intent of this movie but I have always been of the opinion that it is one of the best movie devices against the wish to have children conform to an unrealistic and domineering pretense of what is in the best interest of anyone other than that of the children themselves. I hope to one day see this movie on DVD. I am at the starting gate... waiting.,positive
You may have serious doubts about watching the third sequel to The Stepford Wifes  but this is an absolute classic. Much scarier in premise than the first  and very entertaining. It only got a video release here in the UK  but should be released worldwide for everyone to enjoy.,positive
The Stepford Children is the second best Stepford movie in the Stepford series.I saw the original The Stepford Wives in the theater when it came out in 1975.I was absolutely blown away it was terrific.I have seen all of the Stepford movies  and I like all of them.I think that The Stepford Children is such a campy and fun movie.I just watched it again recently on tape  and I enjoyed it immensely.The cast in this movie was real good to watch. Barbara Eden did a bang up job as usual.Every role that she has ever played has been very good.Barbara Eden is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and nurturing type of person.Don Murray as the husband and father was just perfect in this movie.He was particularly effective at being the irritated father to his two teenage children.I made sure that I have all of the Stepford movie on tape to enjoy.If you get a chance to see this movie you should.,positive
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood  I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday  since it originally played on USA networks. Does Anyone know where to buy this movie  or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me? Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again. I don't think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about  people only know of the Stepford wives and Stepford husband movies. No one is familiar with the fact that there was a children version. Maybe they should also do a re-make of it since they seem to be doing that a lot lately with a lot of my favorite old thriller/horror flicks. Well if anyone has any input Please I Beg Of You write me with information. Thanks Taira tcampo23@aol.com,positive
I was half-dozing as I watched a late night selection of short films--but sat bolt upright from the first frames of I Shout Love and could not take my eyes away for its full  brief  perfect length. With incredibly assured pacing and performances  this film maintains its funny/sad/insightful tone throughout. The credits at the end went by so quickly and in such small type  I had to go online to find out the person responsible for this master work. What a pleasing surprise to see the name of Sarah Polley  a major actress who is too seldom seen.<br /><br />Kristen Thomsen (Tessa) and Matthew Ferguson (Bobby) turn in rich  touching performances as a couple in the throes of breaking up. As they work through a reprise of Tessa's favorite moments from their time together  both actors reveal dimensions of their characters and their relationship in ways that bring nothing but honor to their talents--and to the director/writer's skills. The film creates a moving narrative with laugh-out-loud moments and caught-breath sorrow.<br /><br />I Shout Love is unquestionably one of the greatest and most memorable short films I ever expect to see. It has wit  heart and stunning originality. It matters.,positive
So real and surreal  all in one. I remember feeling like Tessa. Heck  I remember being Tessa. This was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending. I especially liked the protesters tangent. It is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it. If you get the chance to see this  take it. It is well worth the 30 minutes.,positive
This is a very moving film that takes a new twist on somewhere we've all been: a relationship as it's about to end. Kristen Thomson's performance as Tessa  desperately trying to hold onto her connection with Bobby for just one more day  is extremely convincing and moving and takes you right into the story. Who hasn't been faced with the end of a relationship and at least wanted to shout out tearfully  Just one more night! When he does give her one more night  the journey that these two people share makes you pause and think about how precious every truly close relationship can be  and how each one - whether permanent or not - should be treated with respect  rather than simply thrown away.,positive
In moments of desperation were willing to do whatever it takes to win. I loved how the Maple Leaves futility was used as a metaphorical basis for Bobby and Tessa. The acting was accurate by far superior from the hogwash intake given by the film industry.<br /><br />Great editing! At the end of the short I felt it was a bit incomplete but so is life and this is were life and art waltz into cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />Excuse me while I rinse off the cheese whiz  but I guess it's acceptable at certain times.<br /><br />Two scenes which I must point out are: The bath tub and the couch scene.<br /><br />The couch scene for Tessa was a defining moment and 360 of the human condition. Throughout the short I viewed her as a brute  but now we see her true reality. Her mind spoke before her heart. Need I say more about the bath tub scene.,positive
Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are brilliant as Sir and his Dresser. Of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of theatre  and I think you listen better in theatre; but on the screen we become more intimate  we're 'up-close' more than we are in the theatre  we witness subtle changes in expression  we see better as well as listen. Both the play and the movie are wondrous: moving  intelligent  illuminating--of the backstage story of the company  of historical context  of the two main characters  and of the parallel characters in Lear itself. If you cannot get to see it in a theatre (I don't imagine it's produced much these days) then  please  do yourself a favor  and get the video.,positive
"My yardstick for measuring a movie's watch-ability is if I get squirmy. If I start shifting positions and noticing my butt is sore  the film is too long. This movie did not even come close to being boring. Predictable in some parts sure  but never boring.<br /><br />All of the other military branches have had love notes written about them and seen their recruitment levels go up  why not the Coast Guard too? They are definitely under-appreciated  until the day your boat sinks that is.<br /><br />The movie was very enjoyable and fun. Kevin Costner is perfect as the aging macho man who doesn't know when to quit. However  I was most impressed by Ashton Kutcher's performance. I have never liked him  never watched any of his TV shows and always considered him an immature ... well  punk. In this film  he does a great job! He is well on his way to having leading-man status. I think the film we were shown must have been an advance rough cut or something  because about 2/3 of the way in  the film stock turned very grainy  the sound level dropped and microphones were seen dropping down all over the place. Also at the viewing were representatives from the movie  looking for audience feedback - particularly on the parts of the film we didn't like.<br /><br />*****POSSIBLE SPOILER: The feedback I gave concerned a a couple of lines in the beginning. Kevin Costner comes home to see his wife  Sela Ward  packing her stuff up and moving out. He says  Maybe I should be the one to move out. And she replies  No, you don't know where anything is in this house; I should be the one to go. This doesn't make sense: If she knows the layout so well  Costner is right  he *should* be the one to leave.",positive
At the beginning of this film  which I found myself watching on IFC in the wee hours of the morning  I was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that I didn't know if I wanted to continue watching...although it didn't really seem to me that I had much of a choice  so compelling was the situation.<br /><br />Gradually  though  that feeling of discomfort waned (although it never really disappeared entirely)  and I felt drawn into Tessa & Bobby's predicaments  and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together.<br /><br />Really just a moving  powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia  so now I love it even more.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it. ...If your lucky enough to catch it on the Independent Film Channel sometime  or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it.,positive
Excellent and moving story of the end of a uniquely intimate affair. Then again  the point of the film  to paraphrase another comment  is that every relationship can be unique and intimate. A truly quality short film which caught me at my busiest  yet had the power to pull me down onto the sofa and watch  fixed and quiet  for the duration. Bobby and Tessa are powerfully moving characters and anyone who has suffered the end of a love affair will find this film to be a cathartic exercise. Beyond that  the 'film within a film' idea plays out very well with this cast and is quite riveting  though in a somewhat melancholic way.,positive
"Comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years  with Mike Myers' 'Austin Powers' and Rowan Atkinson's 'Johnny English'  and more recently Steve Carell in the big-screen version of the hit '60's show 'Get Smart!'.<br /><br />Back in 1974  it was David Jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attaché case full of documents marked 'Classified'.<br /><br />'The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs' was his first starring role in a sitcom  after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as 'Six Dates With Barker'  the 'Doctor' series  and 'Hark At Barker'.<br /><br />Humphrey Barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in Bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside Michael Palin  Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the children's comedy show 'Do Not Adjust Your Set!'.<br /><br />'T.T.S.L.O.E.B' cast Jason as 'Edgar Briggs'  a well-meaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service. Whereas John Steed wore a bowler hat  Briggs had a trilby. Whereas Napoleon Solo carried a radio pen  Briggs owned a pipe. Objects fell to bits in his hands. He read Confidential documents in bed while his wife ( Barbara Angell ) perused Woman's Own ( on one occasion it would be the other way round ). When he tracked a pair of Russian agents to a heliport  he accidentally switched on the airport's Tannoy system  and broadcast his plans to capture them! When he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an S.I.S. man and his enemy-contact  it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to Brighton! When he tried to organise the defection of a female Russian scientist  he took a 'short cut' to elude his pursuers  only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park. Yet  like 'Inspector Clouseau'  he always seemed to come out on top at the end  much to the dismay of his colleagues.<br /><br />As previously mentioned  he was married. His wife Jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did. Though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their high-rise flat: Secret Service this, Secret Service that! You never stop thinking about the Secret Service!. He shouted back: Think of the neighbours! They're not supposed to know I'm in the Secret Service!.<br /><br />Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included 'Coronation Street' villain Mark Eden ( he was the psychotic Alan Bradley ) as 'Spencer'  Michael Stainton as 'Buxton'  and 'Doctor At Sea''s Elisabeth Counsell as the lovely 'Cathy Strong'. They answered to 'The Commander'  played by the late Noel Coleman. The Commander was kidnapped in one episode  leaving Briggs temporarily in charge of the S.I.S. - which naturally horrified everyone.<br /><br />This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna  who had written for the 'Doctor' series. Rather than spoof Bond  it was more of a send-up of the serious spy shows such as 'Callan' ( though it had a Bond-style theme tune ). Furtive meetings in underground car parks  code-breaking  stolen missile plans  that kind of thing. Jason brought a lot of energy to the role  doing a lot of his own stunts  such as Briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat  and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin  and were reminiscent of those to be found in the 'Pink Panther' films.<br /><br />'Briggs' had all the ingredients to be a smash-hit. Unfortunately  it was not networked. In the London area  it was put out on Sundays at 7.25 P.M. where it was trounced in the ratings by the B.B.C.'s soapy drama 'The Brothers'. It was then moved to Fridays at 7 P.M. because I.T.V. wanted to showcase its latest American import - the T.V. version of 'Planet Of The Apes'. Briggs never found an audience. A similar fate befell Jason's next major show: 1976's 'Lucky Feller'. It was not until 1977 and 'A Sharp Intake Of Breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle.<br /><br />You can see the title sequence ( along with two brief excerpts in German! ) for this series on YouTube. Unfortunately  that is all you can see. Jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on D.V.D. A great shame. For the moment  however  Edgar Briggs' life will have to remain top secret.<br /><br />CODA: I have seen a number of episodes recently and I'm pleased to say it stands up incredibly well.",positive
In the '60's/'70's  David Jason was renowned for his many supporting roles in television comedies such as 'Do Not Adjust Your Set!'  'Hark At Barker' and the 'Doctor' series. It was in 1974 that he landed his first leading role  in London Weekend Television's 'The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs'  written by Richard Laing & Bernard McKenna.<br /><br />Edgar Briggs is a secret agent of the 'S.I.S' ('Secret Intelligence Service'). He genuinely tries to do his job well but always seems to mess things up. Astonishingly enough  though  he always succeeds in getting to the bottom of cases  much to the amazement of his colleagues- 'Buxton' (Michael Stainton)  'Spencer' (Mark Eden) and 'Cathy' (the lovely Elisabeth Counsell)  all of which answer to 'The Commander' (Noel Coleman).<br /><br />Briggs is married to 'Jennifer' (Barbara Angell)  a woman who  much like Michele Dotrice's 'Betty' from 'Some Mother's Do 'Ave 'Em!'  has the patience of a saint and stands by her hare-brained (but well-meaning) husband  no matter what.<br /><br />Like 'Some Mother's Do 'Ave 'Em' and 'The Baldy Man'  'T.T.S.L.O.E.B' was laced completely with slapstick. Each episode saw Jason perform stunts such as plummeting from a high window sill or falling from the top of a ladder while decorating his flat. It was 'custard pie in the face' stuff really.<br /><br />'Edgar Briggs' was not a big hit  due to poor scheduling from I.T.V. A shame as it was an amusing and enjoyable show  well served by its star and the fine support cast. The leading man  though  did not seem to enjoy the experience of the show. David Jason vetoed repeat screenings of the show because he felt his acting in it was non-refined. Granted  the David Jason who played 'Del Boy'  'Inspector Frost' and 'Pop Larkin' is way different to the one that played Briggs but by no means was his acting unrefined. Most actors would have turned Briggs into a ridiculous caricature but Jason's performance made Briggs a credible  realistic figure. Odd perhaps  but not unimaginable.<br /><br />Jason's next vehicle was 'Lucky Feller'  in which he played mummy's boy 'Shorty Mempstead'. It too failed to make the ratings. His lucky break came in the shape of A.T.V's 'A Sharp Intake Of Breath'  in which he played walking disaster area 'Peter Barnes' for four series between 1977-1981. So  while not outstanding as such  'Briggs' is an easy and worthwhile watch. Nice 'James Bond' style theme tune  too!,positive
With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses  this was in my opinion David Jason's finest series.<br /><br />Coming straight after his TV debut on 'Do Not Adjust Your Set!'  these 13 episodes revealed a mastery of comic timing not seen since the old silent movie days. By comparison  Porridge  Open All Hours and that awful series 'Lucky Man' did not come close.<br /><br />I believe Jason banned the series being repeated because it showed him at his rawest. Shame on him. A new generation deserves to enjoy this. The series actually flopped in the ratings but that is most likely because it was shown against 'The Brothers' which aired on BBC at the same time  before VCRs were commonplace.<br /><br />BTW  I have only just noticed that his long suffering assistant  Spencer  was played by Mark Eden ; Alan Bradley off Coronation Street. I am amazed he didn't try to murder Edgar Briggs!!!!,positive
Me and my mates used to gather together in one house to watch this on a Friday night before going to the pub. It was the only programme that ever made us miss opening time. It is one of the best comedies I have ever watched if not the best. David Jason was brilliant and was compared many times to Buster Keaton with his clever stunts that were pulled off so believably. I wish I could get hold of the series on DVD to watch again. He had an amazing ability to make stupid things look believable and this series shows how much talent he has in so many different directions. He is an accomplished Trip and fall guy and I remember watching a trailer once where he showed people how to do this professionally. Certainly he is the one to teach people this art. He only showed glimpses of it in other programs he did. Pshaw  this program shows how multi talented he is. I am lost as to why David Jason vetoed another series being made  as for my mind it was one of the best things he has ever done and I've been a fan of his since he did this series. It is said he did not like it because it showed the rawness of his early career. Well to my mind  that might possibly have been the right decision when he took it  but now his career has progressed so far  I believe this would be a good time for him to do another series showing him looking back on his secret life full of blunders that he does not see.

Jacqueline Hyde is a good quality film and does manage to be likable because of what it is. Everyone out there will like it! Sandwiched between the amount of breast shots  the times Jacqueline rubs herself  the various times Jackie spends chatting to herself and the times spent heaving in the Magdelena Mountains  this could create one hell of a dishwasher if your career were to end.<br /><br />Unlike most horror movies that take place in space or in some restless tranquility with ripe green apples  this one takes awhile to guzzle. The performing is good. Other than great acting by Dan the pizza delivery guy (must see)  there are no standouts  but no notably bad outcroppings from my recent dinner either (and I do mean recent). Excellent acting overall because there are no typically dreadful actors which you'd find in movies of the four Skin related data fields or in the biological skimmer's found in any IBM shop. In addition if you see a female in this movie  the likelihood is that she will be butt naked by the next scene! Now that I think about it  there is quite a bit of action in this movie. Between the first and the second electro yank obtained from a hot chick and the time you observe her buckets naked  keeps em' speculating. I loved it!,positive
Anyone who critiques 'Jacqueline Hyde' as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that it's intended to be is just not playing with a full deck. Just from the title  it's obvious that this low budget horror comedy isn't meant to be taken seriously... it's as tongue in cheek as a nympho's french kiss  and just as titillating. The female cast members are all great and fun to watch. Check this out  Rolfe Kanefsky is the clown-prince of soft-core horror. Unlike most soft-core horror flicks  this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses. The movie doesn't even attempt to follow the storyline of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic  but instead seeks out every way possible to create risqué sight gags and erotic situations. Blythe Metz  the brunette femme fatale who portrays the sexier  homicidal side of Jacqueline  is a real knockout. Watch and enjoy!,positive
"One thing that came across to me in watching this film is that it was fun/exciting for the cast and crew; I could sense that they were going up against the budget constraint with enthusiasm & dedication because they apparently liked the people involved. <br /><br />I tend to like B movies that are original and have heart  and I think this is one such work. The actors seem to me to be putting there hearts in it more than usual  maybe because of some good direction from the lead actress/director  and they evidently were clear enough in their parts of the story to make a coherent  watchable piece of art. <br /><br />The critiques of this film that more or less say  why not just rent a hardcore porn movie, make the point as to why they didn't like the film. Going to this film hoping for a lot of T&A without patience for the material of the plot is why it is so unenjoyable for them. One could say the movie is more of a romantic work than a softcore porn movie  even though I take it the star has done her share of soft porn. I think she graduated. <br /><br />In terms of the writing  the dialog is not a huge part of the movie  like in a Tarentino film  but the plot is decent and the twists are original and sometimes fun. Particularly the ending is not a disappointment but a pleasure  with the villianess/heroine and the leading man learning from their complex web of feelings. <br /><br />I understand that the producer got a 3 film deal out of this. Hats off for proving a few tens of thousands of dollars can go pretty far if you have some artistic sensibility and pride. <br /><br />Gabriella and the other girls with scenes of nudity were likable along with being hot  not just airhead bimbos  so as an erotic science fantasy piece with some gorgeous nude art  even with the limits of B-movie land  not disappointing.",positive
I have to admit that I had low expectations for this movie. But I was surprised to find it entertaining  interesting  and funny. It's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film. There were moments that made my hairs stand up! Even better  though  were the highly amusing  occasionally hysterical  comedic moments in the film (you'll know which ones I'm talking about). There also are a few great special effects (and the humor and the special effects aren't necessarily separate).<br /><br />The acting  on the whole  is very good--way better than a typical low budget horror film. The lead (Jackie)  in particular  and many of the smaller  supporting roles (like the lawyer  the couple living next door  the pizza man) are well acted. If they hadn't been  the film wouldn't have kept my interest and I would have lost my belief in the story. This is a good  interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth a rental!,positive
A fantastic cinema experience. I really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out. There is nothing to add  except that is a terrible shame that sir Albert Finney still isn't accepted by the AMPAS (American Academy). After roles in such films as Tom Jones  Murder on the Orient Express  Under the Volcano (to name only few - for these he was nominated for the Oscar)  The Dresser is arguably his highlight  yet...<br /><br />I know  Oscars are just popularity contest  but if Americans like British actors and actresses (and the Oscar goes to Jeremy Irons  Daniel Day-Lewis  Anthony Hopkins  Emma Thompson  Glenda Jackson etc. - and they all deserved the award!)  why they always left sir Finney with empty hands?<br /><br />On the other hand  they gave it to John Wayne and Marisa Tomei (in Cousin Vinny). I don't know  should I laugh or cry.<br /><br />If you have seen the two leads in The Dresser  you won't forget what is the art of acting. Watch this film and enjoy! I recommend it to everyone who loves art.<br /><br />I give 9/10 for this excellent film (1 point missing for non-cinematic material  after all it is just a theater)<br /><br />Note: My criteria is much stronger than this on IMDb (10 only for the cinematic masterpiece that should/could last forever).,positive
Breathtaking at it's best  intriguing at it's worst  Francis Ford Coppala's groundbreaking epic 'Apocalypse Now' is one of the most iconic and celebrated motion pictures of the 20th century  and in my opinion  the greatest ever film depiction centered around America's involvement in Vietnam.<br /><br />What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it is uniquely different from any other films of the same genre. Growing up as movie buff  and with a particular interest in war films  I've seen many films  which have attempted to portray the 'images' and 'feelings' of Vietnam but have been unsuccessful in doing so. Films such as 'Hamburger Hill' and 'We were soldiers' fall into the category of trying to capture the atmosphere of Vietnam by depicting 'heroic battles' which are  more often than not  tainted by the zeal of Hollywood film production.<br /><br />In 'Apocalypse now' there are no battles  no heroes or villains  there is nothing in the film that suggests that it is intended to reflect the imagery of Vietnam through the physical aspects of war. Rather  it is a film  which powerfully investigates and explores the human psyche when it has been tormented by the absolute 'horror' of what was the darkest military conflict of the previous century.<br /><br />The sheer brilliance of the acting (in particular the interpretation of taciturn Captain Willard by Martin Sheen)  along with the spectacular cinematography (filmed in the Phillipines)  which provides crucial realism to the backdrop of the film  makes 'Apocalypse Now' an unforgettable epic.<br /><br />Evoking a myriad of emotions and leaving us with a maelstrom of mediation  'Apocalypse now' is not for the light-hearted moviegoer. It is masterpiece that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated.,positive
<br /><br />What more can you ask for? A great screenplay based on one of the finest plays of the latter half of the 20th century  two fine emotional performances by Courtney and Finney  a realistic vision of war time london  a great supporting cast. This film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster through humour  sadness  loss and fulfillment. if you are in the theatre it is even more effective. This is a true 10 on the rating scale !,positive
This is a classic war movie. One of the best  a stark image fest of flashing lights  harrowing dark backgrounds and helicopter blades morphing into ceiling fans. A star-studded spectacle of immense power.<br /><br />Martin Sheen is a mercenary sent up river to assassinate the general gone astray  a sadistic dictator played beyond belief by the great Marlon Brando. Also along for the ride are  Robert Duvall as an over the top DI with a penchant for napalm in the morning or at least the smell of it. Dennis Hopper is an edgy photojournalist with a view slanted views about the war and about his leader. Also in this amazing film you'll see up and coming stars such as Laurence Fishburne  R. Lee Ermey  Sam Bottoms  Albert Hall and keep an eye out for Harrison Ford too...<br /><br />Behind the lens is Francis Ford Coppolla delivering a film with maybe more intensity and drama than the acclaimed Godfather films  he highlights war in it's most basic form  which for the most part is something you can't see  you can only feel it  as the boat carries on up river the feeling of the war tightening in is quite unbearable. The feeling of this is a rather claustrophobic feeling and really makes for unusual moods from the viewers. Honestly no films has ever made me feel like that.<br /><br />Criticism is hard to find. The biggest qualm from some is that Brando earned tons of money for a ten minute role  but in all fairness this is unjustified. It was money well earned  a role that physically restricted him  being at the time an unwell man  and a role that he really made his own. I can't picture anyone better for the role. And if you get the Apocalypse Now Redux version  there's some extra bits of the great man  and I think the Redux does make the film miles better.<br /><br />Final impressions are that if you are lucky to get the Redux version then you will be blessed with a completely satisfying film with a cool 49 minutes extra footage. If not  then still you won't be disappointed  this film is up there with the best  and deserves some great recognition  and a firm place as one of the top 50 films ever made...,positive
This is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our contemporary world. The social criticism of our shallow  commercially oriented values is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the war is hell cliché  underscored by a mythical journey upriver to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a rogue colonel  who's left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw Apocalypse Now in 1980  I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. In particular  I found the final segment of the journey with Brando  which encapsulates Conrad's Heart of Darkness  to be rather boring. I finally got around to seeing Apocalypse Now Redux and the flaws have been taken care of. Redux makes the movie an outright masterpiece  certainly among the top 100 films ever made. Brando's performance now seems full and complete  perhaps rather less mysterious  but much more profound. Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting ensembles ever assembled. It's great to spot a young Harrison Ford  Scott Glenn  etc. in early screen performances that suggest what fine actors they will eventually be recognized as. The work of Robert Duvall  Fred Forrest  Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage. If you've never seen this film  skip the original and head straight for Redux. I wish we could get a Gangs of New York Redux from Scorcese to fill in all the gaps in that deeply flawed potential masterpiece.,positive
I would like to submit the following goof.<br /><br />During the bridge scene  soldiers are seen wading out in the river  asking to be taken away and seeking to escape. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and attempt to board carrying with them suitcases. Soldiers are not issued nor do they ever carry suitcases into a combat zone. They have duffel bags  packs and footlockers but not suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of keeping. Additionally  if you look closely  you will see that the suitcase is floating on top of the water. This is probably a very good indication that it is empty otherwise it would sink.,positive
You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed. Or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of judgement); that layer is completely uninteresting.<br /><br />Or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of Duvall's one-liners  but that's just a coating for commercial mastication.<br /><br />You can try to view this as a 'realistic' Vietnam war film  but ask any veteran and he'll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks.<br /><br />Or view it as a 'will he or won't he' morality play -- nothing rich there  either.<br /><br />Where I found the value was in the superb self-reference. Coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing 'a great man'.<br /><br />Brando the man was as much of a maverick as the Kurtz character. The studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method'  yet he always excelled and won accolades; the 'generals' are uncomfortable with Kurtz's 'unsound methods'  in spite of his strategic genius.<br /><br />So Coppola makes a movie all about Brando's greatness. To hammer on the point  he places himself in the movie (as Hopper  a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises. Brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the actor's power. And he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh  yes: the horror... <br /><br />Other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives  including 'being in the firefight' long before Private Ryan; the ground breaking use of sound  notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip.<br /><br />Don't get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound  vision and self-reference.,positive
I have seen this movie 4 times in 5 months and i never get tired of it just because it is perfect. And it has also got the best film music ever and the best supporting roles ever written for a movie. I mean you just have to love Robert Duval   Marlon Brando   Martin Sheen and Lauerence Fishburne in this movie but specially Duval. I can not believe that Kramer vs. Kramer did win an Oscar in stead of this amazing war movie. So this is my conclusion if you take the director of the worlds greatest movie ( The Godfather ) and the best of Hollywood actors you can only succeed. Now I just have to writhe something to get this preview so do not read this except the last line. This movie rules !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,positive
Brilliant actors and brilliant picture!! I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning  it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic! The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances. Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects. This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination. A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate. How insane the world is and the power of will and friendship  love and passion. A must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever! Many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this!!,positive
This movie is a must see for any war movie buff. One of the greatest movies of all time and loaded with great quotes such as:<br /><br />Kilgore: If I say its safe to surf this beach Captain  then its safe to surf this beach!<br /><br />Kilgore: Smell that? You smell that? Lance: What? Kilgore: Napalm  son. Nothing in the world smells like that. Kilgore: I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know  one time we had a hill bombed  for 12 hours. When it was all over  I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em  not one stinkin' dink body. The smell  you know that gasoline smell  the whole hill. Smelled like... victory. Someday this war's gonna end...,positive
It's that film that loads of people hail as a classic - Apocalypse Now  now a re-cut  re-up  Redux 22 years after it's original release.<br /><br />The film is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness  it's main plot (if it has one) being Capt. Willard's journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict on his way to terminate a rogue Colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets  and he tells the Colonel's story along the way.<br /><br />My initial feelings towards the film is that it's not particularly gripping at times  especially early on  but at least a good dose of comedy is put in  in the form of surfing fanatic Col. Kilgore. As the film progresses however  a good deal of tension is built up with Willard's reading through various reports on Col. Kurtz until the end is in sight  when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches an incredible level and holds it there until the end.<br /><br />The usual aspects everyone looks for in a decent film are all of a good standard. Cinematography in particular stands out as exceptional  and I found the performances of Martin Sheen  Marlon Brando  Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest to all be worthy of a special mention. The score I found initially sounded out of place  but as the film progressed... I'm not entirely sure if it did actually get better  or it fitted better  or if it had just grown on me  but by the end of the film I was thoroughly enjoying it.<br /><br />This is the second time I have seen the Redux version  (I have seen the original around four times) I'll say now that the first time I saw it I was disappointed. I was expecting a classic film  with lots of war. The fact that Willard got the mission at the beginning of the film and didn't carry it out until the end had me bored because all of the character interaction on the way that IS the film seemed unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not entirely defined (as the focus is more on the character and the journey more than the plot)  in most cases a second viewing is needed to appreciate the film fully (as with all films that are more character than plot based)  as the second time around  you know where the plot is going. I had a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life  which is now one of my favourite films.<br /><br />With the big four Vietnam films  Apocalypse Now wins over the rest on atmosphere  but lacks the action and involvement of Platoon  the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter  and cannot really be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favourite of the four). Apocalypse Now is a great piece of work  especially towards the end where it becomes staggering  and is to be recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character based film and doesn't mind some casual violence.,positive
First of all  I believe that this movie is much more appreciated by viewers who have actually read Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness  the book that was the literary basis for the movie. With that said  I believe that this movie is astounding. It is an excellent war film that doesn't so much concentrate on the gore and brutality of the Vietnam Conflict  but more the psychological toll that it took on the young  inexperienced kids who were sent to fight it. Coppola showed real genius in the art of film-making  using many visuals to help tell the story. The acting I felt was definitely all-around up to par. Marlon Brando's part in the movie is what really got me as far as acting. His elucidation to Willard at the end of the film reels you in  and reveals the hollowness of a man that you've heard about and wanted to see throughout the movie. Those who would consider this just another war movie need to give a detailed look to all the literary elements that are entwined with this film  because there is a great amount of meaning behind it all. In my opinion  this is one of the most sculptured and best-made films of all time.,positive
"Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great ending for a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s there was an atmosphere of tolerance  open-mindness  and progressiveness among the studios that allowed the making of major films by a few of the best directors that the United States has ever had. I am not a historian  but all the events that preceded the decade (a few being the violent deaths of major figures of the American political and cultural scenes  the racial struggles  the emergence of the 1960s counter-culture  the increase of violence and death in the streets...) seemed to influence the vision of filmmakers who were willing to dare  be different  and create entertaining and intelligent motion pictures. Coppola's film is a strange blend of humanistic thinking and skillful film-making  following the parameters of war and adventure films  and at the same time subverting them with its flowing reflections on the value of life  the reason of death  or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work  made against all odds  chronicled in the 1991 documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse; a motion picture that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam war ever to reach the screen. This may not be the definite Vietnam motion picture  but dealing with it Coppola defied the formula of classic melodrama found in two Vietnam movies made simultaneously  The Deer Hunter and Coming Home  or in latter ones as Platoon and Casualties of War  before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre  as horror in Jacob's Ladder  or comedies as Good Morning, Vietnam  among the more respectable. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the background of a search for answers to questions faced by any man every day of his life  without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.",positive
"I decided I need to lengthen up my review for my all time favorite film. Unlike other war films that focus on the event  Apocalypse Now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip. The sheer surrealism makes the body uncomfortable  yet you can't lay your eyes off of it. Based off of Joseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness  Apocalypse Now slowly descends its protagonist  Willard (Martin Sheen) into madness  most likely the same way Kurtz plunged into insanity. The production of this film is notorious for its delays provided by the monsoon season and for Brando's unprepared performance (he read his lines from cue cards). There is a documentary titled Apocalypse Now: A filmmakers Apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this.<br /><br />The opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film. As the blade of the helicopters are heard in slow motion and napalm is dropped in the trees  the song The End by the Doors can be heard. The next shot is of Willard in his bed with the fan on  so the noise of the helicopter coincides with the fan. We are informed that he does special missions for the military  mostly assassinations. When his next mission is given to him  he is baffled. Charging a man with murder here is like giving a speeding ticket in the Indy 500. The man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with tribes people. Kurtz is ordering atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped. Willard does not go alone however. He is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles. Along the way  they meet Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore Hoorah about the war. Willard ponders that if Kilgore is that crazy  what could Kurtz be like. There are many scenes that portray Willards plunge into insanity: The tiger attack  the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese  the nonstop rain  the piled dead bodies scattered about  and the deaths of his crew members. When he reaches the Kurtz compound  he is greeted by the village people and a hippie photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). Instead of assassinating Kurtz right away  Willard begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do. Kurtz  on the other hand wants to die. He is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier. Willard kills him with a machete while in unison  a buffalo is sacrificed with several machetes by the people. Once they realize their leader has been slain  instead of killing Willard  they hail him as their new king. Willard rejects the offer and leaves them.<br /><br />The cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking. The colors are grain free  something that is rare in older movies. I can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery.<br /><br />The acting ensemble is terrific  with everyone playing their parts well. Many criticize Brando for some reason  but I think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the war.<br /><br />The soundtrack and the score are haunting  and provide the mood for the film. I am wondering what instrument they used in that guitar-like sound when the credits roll? There have been many parodies of this film  but my favorite quote comes from Marge Simpson when she explains to Homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot: Your character provides comic relief for the show, like um, Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. Those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious.",positive
I have always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was lucky enough to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981  as he waited for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this work of art  especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is  without a doubt  a must see  a complete 10 and an important part of American Film History. Charlie Don't Surf. Robert Duvall's famous line (the other one) does not need repeating as it has become an oft repeated anthem and his Pattonesque character will long be remembered as a classic American war hawk in the John Wayne tradition. It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.,positive
Even with all the cinema dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's Ladder  The Deer Hunter  Apocalypse Now  and Taxi Driver to an extent) one feels that we don't even know the half of what happened. Even contemplating the horror feels inhuman. And a progression - or retreat? - to the inhumanity that it necessitates is a key part of Apocalypse Now  Coppola's greatest and one of the most important films ever made. Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 classic  Heart of Darkness which chronicles the loss of sanity and corruption of morality that comes with distance from civilization - a surfacing of a bestial nature  as it were  a la Lord of the Flies - it brings the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam. The story is of Willard  a general commissioned on a special mission to Cambodia after his first tour of duty in Vietnam is served. Willard at the beginning of the film is stuck in Saigon  psychologically unable to go back home - eerily echoing Nicky in The Deer Hunter. So he is contacted: his mission is to assassinate a renegade Green Beret who has isolated himself in a remote outpost on the Nung River  and who has purportedly gone completely insane - worshiped like a god by the natives  and killing indiscriminately. This man's name is Colonel Kurtz  played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best being Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). As Willard journeys upriver in an army boat with some soldiers accompanying  his witnessing the horrors and the insanity - and the overwhelming pointlessness of it all - leads to an eerie sympathy and identification with Kurtz before they even meet. By the time they do  Kurtz's methods don't really seem as wrong or as they should  and they certainly don't seem too unusual or out-of-place. Apocalypse - a place beyond morality  the outpost on the end of the world. The loss of civilization  the loss of judgement  of self. Kurtz's monologue about an atrocity he witnessed as a Green Beret  and his later revelation  is one of the most chilling and well-delivered speeches in cinema history. The film is about trauma  about the human spirit and its breaking point - here  it's a lot like The Deer Hunter  and just as good. Apocalypse  however  takes the boundaries of what we can endure to a global level - Coppola's sweeping footage of the humid  murky jungles of Cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amid exploding forests and an orange sky - set to an oddly fitting Doors soundtrack - as well as chilling scenes on the river and of an air raid on a village with Wagner blasting from speakers (a scene which has gone down as one of the most chilling  darkly humorous  and strikingly pointless war scenes ever) - this all contributes to the sense of Apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at some distant point in the future  but Apocalypse Now and forever. The Deer Hunter is much more up close and personal  you can even tell by the title  and shows the totalling effect trauma has on the individual psyche  the breaking down of the human soul  and its ability to either surrender completely to forces of darkness  or to limp on. This is why both films are equal - they are two parts of the same thing. In Heart of Darkness  Kurtz is shown as conflicted between morality (civilization) and his inner savage. In Apocalypse Now  Kurtz has left all conflict behind. He is beyond good and evil. He has let go of morality like a drowning man lets go of a saving hand in the moments before his death. Kurtz indeed is only waiting for death  quoting T. S. Eliot in his temple to himself  lost in the jungle. His last words  and the words echoed at the end of the movie  are  The horror...the horror. He is referring to the infinite void of existence  of the human psyche  and to the pitch black emptiness within his own mind  where atrocities are born again. It is impossible to express in words the experience one goes through watching this film - the experience  in short  that Willard experiences on his journey. The end part  at the outpost  almost in fact comparable to its brother scene in The Deer Hunter  is one of the most deeply  calmly  and seductively disturbing things I've ever seen.,positive
Movies seem to fall into two categories: films that reinforce existing societal values and beliefs  and those that challenge them. This film is a 180-degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric portrayed in offerings like The Longest Day and The Green Berets which seem more like Disney fantasies by comparison. The Apocalypse Now! project  the production and resulting film  is Heart of Darkness updated into a psychological horror story of the late 20th century post-modernist variety. The cast and crew who worked on it probably could relate to the terrifying places the human mind can achieve. This is the plight of Joseph Conrad's original character Kurtz who came into literary being in 1901 and subsequently referenced in TS Eliot's The Hollow Men (Mistah Kurtz  he dead) of 1925. Although neither a straight telling of Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1901) nor a first-hand account of the Vietnam experience  Apocalypse Now! stands as a masterpiece which pushed on the envelope of cinematic potential. Apocalypse is not just about the horrors of war per se  like Platoon and The Deer Hunter  but the darker sensibilities of human nature as revealed through the raw and demeaning confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. Apocalypse Now! is not so much seen as experienced.<br /><br />The bulk of the movie is the journey of a trained secret assassin  Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tour-de-force performance)  aboard a US military boat traversing an unnamed river into the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few westerners would ever tread. His mission is to terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando)  a career army Special Forces Division officer who was the darling of the US Military until he went AWOL and renegade in the deep uncharted jungles between Vietnam  Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the colonel has gone insane but as events play out  something else has happened to him that is far more terrifying than simply insanity. Sheen's mission is to terminate the colonel with the American public none the wiser.<br /><br />The movie is rather episodic. The journey along the river is made up of several vignettes as Sheen and his crew meet different self-contained aspects of the war at the ground level. American audiences of the 1970's had probably never seen this kind of film-making before  with the possible exception of The Deer Hunter which was released in the previous year. The first  and one of the most notable  is an helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar-nominated performance) who is a cross between General Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He loves to play Ride of the Valkyries from Wagner's The Ring when he bombards helpless villages. His line I love the smell of Napalm in the morning is one of those oft-quoted lines from the annals of cinema. Other encounters include an amphitheater where enlisted privates will be entertained by the likes of Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies.<br /><br />Despite all the production catastrophes that impeded getting this footage into the can  the remarkable aspect of this film is its pacing. The original release (not the later Redux version) does a fine of job of building until the viewer is emotionally prepared to deal with the climactic confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is worth the price of admission alone. And some of the shots of both Sheen and Brando in certain places are some of the starkest and terrifying images ever produced on film. Not even the likes of Clive Barker  Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in terms of horrific imagery. Brando's Kurtz in one scene in particular is so utterly terrifying it makes most other horror movies seem tame by comparison  which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from without but from within.<br /><br />Without giving too much away  Coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations. According to the documentary Hearts of Darkness  Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene would lapse into melodrama  and the atmosphere of the movie's darker hues would be compromised. He wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to witness the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox as practiced by the native people with whom Coppola was using as extras in the scenes with Kurtz at his village. After the viewing  Coppola had his ending  and it is one of the most simultaneously disturbing and beautiful sequences in the history of American film-making. Love it or hate it  no western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene.<br /><br />This film is not for all tastes just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on airplanes. It's not just the violence and the pointlessness of violence that are difficult for most American viewers to absorb. It's the naked unveiling of aspects of the human condition that seem so removed from suburban American life that make this film difficult for the average movie-goer to handle  which is as it should be. Coppola did not make a family picture. However  if the viewer can understand its larger point  there is a lot to be gotten out of Apocalypse Now!. If you're looking for a film experience to reaffirm pre-existing attitudes about American sensibility and heroism  better stick with John Wayne. But if you're willing to be taken into places you've never been  even beyond the evils of war rhetoric  Apocalypse Now will take you into a world you thought you'd never visited before  and the disturbing part of it is that you may recognize it.,positive
Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) has been sent on a classified mission into Cambodia during the Vietnam War to assassinate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he has gone completely insane and is no longer taking orders. And since Kurtz is one of the most decorated men in the armed forces  it is hard for Capt. Willard to understand how Col. Kurtz could go off the deep end as he has  killing without clearance and taking the war into his own hands. What possibly could have pushed this great man over the top? Through Willard's long journey through the jungle to find his target  he tries with some success to understand why. But what will he decide to do once he finds him?<br /><br />Any movie that can start out with The Doors' The End is a great movie in my book  especially if it can flow with the mood and imagery shown with the song. Apocalypse Now does this perfectly. I can't think of anything better for it to be set to  the Vietnam War and the insanity in the soliders' minds that it created. AN is a dark and brutal story about a long journey through some of the hairiest jungle in Vietnam  the ultimate destination of which is murder. Through it's use of music and score alone  we are thrown into a dark world of mystery  violence  and insanity. A perfect example of how to set mood through music alone is this film right here. <br /><br />An overall great cast  with the exception of Laurence Fishburne  of which Sheen and Brando give us more than enough acting skills to spread around on our movie desire bread. I just don't like Fishburne  ever since I found out he was Cowboy Curtis in PeeWee's playhouse my contempt and hatred for this man has increased ten fold. I realize the pettiness of this but I simply do not care. We need to sick Gary Oldman on him. Brando is excellent as Col. Kurtz and I can't think of any other actor that could have played the good man gone insane and hold such screen presence. Sheen is also fun to watch as Willard and we can identify with his questioning of his mission and the war in general. My favorite character in the movie has to be Robert Duvall's Lt. Colonel Kilgore. Before this film I never pictured Duvall as a wartime cowboy but honestly it's my favorite of his parts to date. He simply nailed his character  which is one of the best in the entire film  as the gung-ho Air Cavalry commander who loves to surf. Maybe a little over the top but still brilliant. I also love the smell of napalm in the morning.<br /><br />The plot is a fairly simple one and it doesn't take too much brainpower to figure out what's going on. Willard's mission is to kill Kurtz  plain and simple. But it's the journey of the film that is really it's heart and also the dire situations of war itself. In the Redux version we are forced to sit through the extended French plantation scene and the Playboy bunny scene which really adds nothing to the film's entirety other than it makes it a longer journey. I don't feel they take away anything though  it's just a matter of if you want to watch a three and a half hour movie or the original. Through this journey  the film points out the utter futility and irrelevance of the war to the Americans and the massive effect it had on the soldiers who fought in it...in fact  that's the entire point. On top of that  the troops were not supported by the public and that could very well have helped cause a character like Kurtz' to go completely mad. <br /><br />A big war movie lover  this one is up there with Platoon and The Deer Hunter  all of them classics. I sometimes try to compare films of the same genre to one another but it has gotten me in trouble in the past in my reviews as I have had to go back on what I've said. All three have their own strengths and add their own twist to the Vietnam War....so to really say one is better than the other is fairly pointless...even if after having most recently view AN I think it's a tad better. In the end  Apocalypse Now is a true classic in either version and worthy of the status it's been given. As a fellow reviewer has previously stated  AN is one of the most ambitious films ever made.,positive
"Spoilers. This review has been edited due to word limit.<br /><br />`The horror. The horror.' Marlon Brando  Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)<br /><br />The sentence which is as famous as `Here's looking at you  kid ' or `Are you talkin' to me?' or `May the Force be with you ' or `I'll be back ' means a little more than some one-liners. When it is spoken it lingers in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go unnoticed. What might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re-watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame.<br /><br />What  exactly  does this line of dialogue mean? The horror spoken of is the reality of war. The reality of moral men being so easily corrupted that they turn on their inborn instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt. When Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) stands before the dying Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) at the end of the film  `The horror.the horror.' is the realization of Willard's corruptness. He has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment. This isn't a typical Hollywood ending. In most cases a character gains something  whether it be emotionally  physically  mentally or all three. But Willard both gains and loses. He gains the knowledge that he has lost his morals. And that is a shocking ending.<br /><br />`Apocalypse Now' is Francis Ford Coppola's tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking. This film is wholly different from `The Godfather.' It is hallucinogenic  visually dazzling  and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. At first it seems realistic  and then it becomes strange  and then symbolic  and  by the end  original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare. This is not as much a film about the Vietnam War as it is a film about the war within us.<br /><br />At first it does appear to be another war film. Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned by an Army Lieutenant (a young Harrison Ford) to assassinate a renegade American Colonel named Kurtz (Brando)  who is hiding out somewhere in Vietnam with a hoard of troops who more or less act as his slaves.<br /><br />Willard carries out his mission `with extreme prejudice ' heading out on a boat along with four soldiers  including the boat captain  Chief (Albert Hall)  Chef (Frederic Forest)  and a very young `Larry' Fishburne (who later went on to appear as Morpheus in `The Matrix').<br /><br />Apocalypse Now is in a many ways a modern update of Homer's Odyssey. As our main character  Willard  carries on his journey  he meets an array of original and strange characters  including Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall)  who has a strange fetish for surfing  and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper)  whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser Jeremy Davies in The Million Dollar Hotel, one of the worst films I have ever seen. Davies failed to make any connection with an audience; Hopper does. He is like the poetic vibe between Willard and Kurtz; he is like an interpreter going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages. In this case  he is translating Kurtz to Willard  although I'm not so sure Kurtz needs a translation of Willard.<br /><br />Many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. Apocalypse Now has many. Kilgore descending upon a Vietnam village playing Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history. There is sharpness to it  a brutality to it  an ironic tone to it  and also a sense of playfulness. When Kilgore kneels down on that beach and says  `I love the smell of napalm in the morning.it smells like victory ' we all crack a smile.<br /><br />I won't lie to you: `Apocalypse Now' is a strange film. It isn't exactly the easiest thing to analyze. The end may frustrate some viewers if they don't understand Marlon Brando's significant speeches. But what it all comes down to  what really matters  is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche. The horror is the realization of war and its effects  not the war itself. Kurtz says  `You have a right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me.' Brando's character  Kurtz  is left to the audience to judge. To many naïve viewers he may appear as a crazy loon whose power got to his head. But that isn't what Francis Ford Coppola is trying to get across. By fighting in Vietnam  Kurtz has realized just how great he had it  and how bad some others had it. By walking through devastated villages he eventually comes to realize that we are the naïve ones  living our lives in a fool's paradise. We are totally naïve to our surroundings and possible misfortunes until they hit. By seeing how unlucky some Vietnamese are  Kurtz realizes just how easily he could be struck by something. Just how easily he could end up like the people around him. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door. Many people think the horror is one thing. It is two. For Kurtz  the horror is the reality of how naïve he was and the reality of the war's impact upon men. And after Willard murders Kurtz  and hears Kurtz's dying words  he realizes it too. He realizes the effects of war. To see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man. And what it has done to him. The horror.<br /><br />5/5 stars -<br /><br />",positive
Well  I've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when I first saw it. It is definitely one of the most unique films ever made.<br /><br />I still think Martin Sheen got dissed big-time in the billing  too. He dominates the film yet gets lesser billing than Marlon Brando  who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours  17 minutes film (theatrical version). How unfair is that?<br /><br />Sheen is fantastic in here  especially his narration  which runs throughout. It's one of the best narrations  if not THE best  I have ever heard in a movie. His voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible  nightmare-like adventure. I never fail to appreciate his work in this movie.<br /><br />The other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes  ones I have never forgotten  such as......<br /><br />Sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie's first scene; Robert Duvall and the totally out-of-place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music blaring out of the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle; the weird scenes on the long riverboat ride; the appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greeting the crew in Cambodia and then Brando's bizarre character. It goes on and on with strange scenes.<br /><br />That's not to say I enjoyed everything. No  there are a few very unpleasant scenes  such as the one in which an ox is sliced in half (can't watch that anymore)  an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheen's young stoned-out crew  and the crew is a little too goofy at times. Then  there is the huge amount of profanity  led by way too many f-words.<br /><br />So  there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this One thing for sure: it is a film you WILL remember!,positive
From all of the Vietnam war movies this is probably the most frightening and disturbing and that is really saying a lot with so many spectacular ones that have come out. It has this freakish feel to it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie it scares you. It is not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What does push to such a high level is the: <br /><br />The directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows of his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors he makes you feel as if you are in the war. Most others just display and show you the horrors of war. Coppola though makes you feel confused  shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us from a movie or story. This is something that I have only experienced very few times while watching a film. The writing was of course amazing too. It brought you write into the middle of the movie. It never made me bored and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the directing which very much added to the freakish experience of watching this film showing all the chaos around you even when everything seems calm.<br /><br />The acting was bone-chilling. Just look at Marlon Brando also giving his last great performance playing a deluded  out of whack colonel. When ever I think of a crazy gone made soldier I think Marlon Brando in Apocalpyse Now. With Brando n this film you don't want to look into his eyes. Like the movie he was freakish. To me this performance is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen gave a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career making you see everything through his eyes all the craziness he is experiencing and yet wanting him to get to his goal. It is just a wonder why these two did not get Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall was able to show part of that craziness with his ludicrous battle strategies  among those playing music to tell the enemy he is coming. Also Duvall's character asking one of the soldiers to surf in the middle of a battle was just shocking but believable. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne  Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a cliché. Also for once cameos were put into good use having Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford who I both love.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved in the making of it is at their best. There is nothing more I could ask of this movie with its great acting  directing  writing  cinematography and great ending. Watch and you will see why it lives up to its title Apocalpyse Now.,positive
'The Dresser' is one of those films which are so perfect you really struggle to find something not to like about them. Written by Ronald Harwood (himself a former dresser to the legendary Donald Wolfit)  it sparkles with energy and true love of life behind the footlights.<br /><br />As 'Sir'  the overbearing actor and main focus of the play  Albert Finney is a joy to watch - whether complaining about the lack of a storm during the 'blow  winds ...' bit of 'King Lear' or chatting to his faithful stage manager  Madge (Eileen Atkins  good as ever) about the old times. As Norman  his camp dresser  Tom Courtenay gives a fabulous performance  wiggling around at the beck and call of 'Lear'  collecting a bottle to go at the pub  or bitchily disparaging the former Fool  Mr Davenport-Scott (often mentioned  but never seen!).<br /><br />In an engaging support cast  there's Edward Fox as Oxenby (a typical arrogant second lead)  Zena Walker as her Ladyship  Lockwood West as the replacement Fool  and many others.<br /><br />This film has great energy  bringing with it some of the greasepaint of its stage origins  it is true  but being so well-acted you don't notice. Very well done indeed.,positive
"After the success of the first two 'Godfather' films in 1972 and 1974 respectively  Francis Ford Coppola embarked on an ambitious attempt to bring home the reality of the war in Vietnam  which had concluded with the fall of Saigon to the Vietcong in 1975 The plot was loosely based on the book 'Heart of Darkness ' a story by Joseph Conrad about Kurtz  a trading company agent in the African jungle who has acquired mysterious powers over the nativesCoppola retains much of this  including such details as the severed heads outside Kurtz's headquarters and his final words  The horror the horror <br /><br />In the film  Sheen plays an army captain given the mission to penetrate into Cambodia  and eliminate  with extreme prejudice, a decorated officer who has become an embarrassment to the authorities On his journey up the river to the renegade's camp he experiences the demoralization of the US forces  high on dope or drunk with power <br /><br />Although  as a result of cuts forced on Coppola  the film was accused of incoherence when first released  it was by the most serious attempt to get to grips with the experience of Vietnam and a victorious reinvention of the war film genre In 1980 the film won an Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Sound <br /><br />Apocalypse Now was re-released in 2001 with fifty minutes restored As a result  the motion picture can now be seen as the epic masterpiece it is",positive
I just watched The Dresser this evening  having only seen it once before  about a dozen years ago.<br /><br />It's not a big movie  and doesn't try to make a big splash  but my God  the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.<br /><br />The Dresser is the story of Sir  an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney)  and his dresser Norman (Courtenay)  sort of a valet  putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men  each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole  wheedle  and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him  he is nothing  or thinks he is  anyway.<br /><br />This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters  and as such  it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney  only 47 years old  is completely believable as a very old  very sick  petulant  bullying  but brilliant stage actor. He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser  who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use  though. For although  technically their relationship is that of employer and employee  most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.<br /><br />Yes  there are others in the cast of this movie  but there is no question that the true stars are Finney  Courtenay  and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there aren't other fine performances  most notably Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires  old regrets  and what might have been.<br /><br />Although it doesn't get talked about these days  it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay  Best Picture  Best Director (Peter Yates)  and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />I had remembered this as being a good movie  but I wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about  and be hugely entertained all the while  then I encourage you to see The Dresser.,positive
This movie changed the art of film making  telling a complex story in a powerful new way. The film mixes brutal realism with fantasy  intercutting a modern war with strange scenes full of technicolour smoke. The film uses music not as a score laid in later  but as a practical part of the scene playing from speakers  radios etc. Coppola uses a classic piece of literature as inspiration  taking scenes and characters  and putting them into entirely different surroundings. That is a tricky and brave thing to do. Then he takes a superstar  Brando  pays him a fortune  and films him so that you can barely see his face. The pure guts that such a move requires is astounding  and it works beautifully. This movie belongs in the top ten.,positive
Somewhere on IMDb there is a discussion about the greatest director of all times (Spielberg  Copolla and others are named there). The greatest argument was around Spielberg and whether he is or isn't a great director. The problem with Spielberg is that while he is a master technician  most of his films lack depth.Saving Ryan is really outstanding from a technical point of view  but its message is dull and while its very entertaining  it doesn't make you think about anything. AN is the best movie I ever saw because it combines great shooting with a deep philosophical perspective on so many things  starting from war in general  the clash of civilizations  the condition of soldier in wartimes (is a soldier a hero or an assassin? Brando says he is neither  the french lady says he is both ...) and many others. The problem with some people is that they try to argue about whether these points are true or false. But a great movie  and a great piece of art in general is supposed to spark arguments  not to solve them ... Maybe Coppola is right  or maybe he isn't  nobody holds the truth anyway. You can watch this movie for its outer beauty  amazing scenes  great acting and memorable quotes and you will be entirely satisfied. But what really make this movie a masterpiece is its inner quality. You can't help but make a comparison with the recent Fahrenheit documentary.Both Copolla and Moore tackle similar issues  but while Copolla presents matters from an outside   objective point of view  Moore takes a very partisan position that really compromises the whole point of a documentary ... It is really a shame that a film like Fahrenheit 9/11 won a prestigious award like Cannes. But anyway  if you want to start to understand a little of the Vietnam war  the Iraq war  the second World War and any war in general  you should definitely see this movie  and not the other one ...,positive
"Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now is not a Vietnam War film. Do not confuse it with one. It is set to the back drop of the war  but it is a metaphorical exposition on the deteriorating effects that war has on the human psyche. It is also one of the most audacious films ever made  produced  or even conceived (second to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. To call it a masterpiece would be an understatement of proportions as ambitious as the film's production levels.<br /><br />Opening with no credits and following a memorable first scene playing to the tune of the Doors The End as Martin Sheen's Captain Benjamin L. Willard hallucinates to images of helicopters and napalm  the plot is essentially laid out in the first 15 minutes. Willard's mission is to terminate... with extreme prejudice Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has invariably gone AWOL in the far reaches of the Cambodian jungle and  as told by his general  is out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops. Kurtz is a delusional Colonel now being worshipped by a large group of followers who have dubbed him a god. For Willard  this covert operation seems somewhat more manageable than actual combat  yet  the journey he is about to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the limits of his human behavior.<br /><br />Teaming up with a small crew  they embark down the vast reaches of the river in a rickety boat. Along the way  Willard educates himself on all things Kurtz. During Sheen's raspy voice over  he details his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was a normal man with a family  until a part of him succumbed to the horrors of human brutality and he led himself down the path that Willard is being led. The descent into the jungle is marked by a mesmerizing aura that echoes the battles being fought not to far away. Eventually the power of the experience weights on the group as drugs and a sort of solitary confinement attacks their senses. But Willard seems unfazed and desensitized in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythic figure  he is drawn to the man's power and why he has become what he has become. We know that Willard's slow decay will parallel that of Kurtz's.<br /><br />Marlon Brando has been revered for decades. His presence: unmatchable. His genius: undeniable. But for those unacquainted with his acting prowess and unaccustomed to his physical nuance  Brando can be perceived  in the eyes of an uncompromising film-goer  as a hack. He is most certainly not. Brando was difficult to work with  hard to interpret and impossible to understand  but his talent for unintelligible rants and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. The man obviously knew what he was doing even if we didn't. His Colonel Kurtz is a being of limitless delusions and continual profundity.<br /><br />If the film is any indication of the journeys into hell than Francis Ford Coppola's actual experience with making this masterpiece is a true life account of one man's fanatical struggle to produce a movie. It is reported that during the film's 200 plus day principle photography schedule  Coppola contemplated suicide. The film was not only an undeniable struggle to make; it is a grueling film to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood seep through the pores of the steamy locals and his dedication filters through the orifices of Martin Sheen's haunted soldier Willard.<br /><br />I can not help but feel a warm sense of nostalgia for this type of film. At the dawn of all that was original and unprecedented  films that challenged as well as stimulated were commonplace. Audacity aside  Apocalypse Now is pure film-making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shudder at the return to what has become the norm for today's standards for film: a lack of innovation. It is not simply the unoriginality of the world of cinema today; it is the fact that nobody seems to care to tell a story anymore or to tell one with heart. But we still have the great ones like Coppola's masterpiece  a film which bathed in its ability to give us something deeper than that which we could comprehend.<br /><br />That depth in Apocalypse Now is the step into madness. The killing can disturb. The loss of innocence can unhinge. But it is the damage from within; the countless barrages of images that distress  unnerve and detach us from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts that eventually segregates us from humanity and propels us into the realm of the instinctual  the savage and the animalistic. If the thought of killing does not provide sustenance  the act of killing provides man with its fundamental catharsis.",positive
"i have lost count as to how many times i have watched this movie. i've never grown tired of it since this is a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just don't make movies like this anymore.<br /><br />after recently finally watching the riveting documentary on the making of this film (Hearts of Darkness:a filmmakers journey into madness)  i'm even more amazed that this film even got finished  yet alone turn out so great.<br /><br />the fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungles of the Phillipines is the film's greatest asset. you actually FEEL like your in Vietnam.<br /><br />all of the actors are fantastic with my favorites still being Robert Duvall (I love the smell of napalm in the morning!!) martin sheen  and the great Marlon Brando.<br /><br />a lot of people complain that the film gets too murky  weird and cerebral near the end. well  remeber what Coppolla said about this movie  This film is not about vietnam, it IS vietnam! what he means is that this film is about MADNESS and not the war.<br /><br />this movie is based on the short story Heart of darkness by Joseph Conrad and is set against the vietnam war instead of the civil war as in the book. i think that was a brilliant combination in my opinion.<br /><br />this is perfect  challenging film that is dark  violent  humorous at times and well done in every single possible way.<br /><br />a true classic<br /><br />rating:10",positive
'Apocalypse Now Redux'  Francis Ford Coppola's war opus is probably the most beautiful war film I have ever seen. Capt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnam soldier who is tapped to head a very dangerous and highly classified mission into Cambodia to 'terminate the position' of Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando)  a highly ranked and highly regarded army man who seemingly has gone completely insane and defected from the army  setting up his own little society and helped by a cultish following of soldiers. Escorting him up the river to Cambodia is a handful of navy men  and along the way  they encounter several interesting people (most notably is Robert Duvall's Kilgore  a badass lieutenant colonel with a few screws loose) and some horrifying situations. <br /><br />'Apocalypse' is less historical war film than a philosophical and psychological study. It is more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The running time of 'Apocalypse' is over three hours  but the film is so wonderfully paced and compelling that when the end of the film arrived  I was actually surprised at the amount of time that had passed. The beautiful cinematography is surely what stood out the most for me  however. After seeing this film  I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The 'Godfather' films were all tinged with an almost sepia tone  and shadows created the feeling of a Baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse'  there is an incredible usage of natural light  and the shadows  particularly in the scenes involving Brando and Sheen  almost become a living character  they are so pervasive and effective. Another gorgeous scene was when Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes  and come across a tiger. The sheer enormity of the surrounding foliage (leaves as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian  but the colorization of the scene was incredible. While everything else was almost a muted grey  the leaves were an incredibly vibrant green  an effect that was particularly striking. Another really minor positive moment in the film was the great scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and company attack the small village while playing Wagner. This could have just been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack to the scene  but instead Coppola turns the song into an actual part of the scene  with Duvall mentioning that he likes to play it while they are approaching to 'scare the hell out of them'. <br /><br />The performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. Much has been made of the amount of money Brando earned for the film  and the amount of trouble he caused. Regardless of this  he turned out a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time. Sheen is completely outstanding - this is the first time I have seen him really unleash in a film  and Duvall is a lot of fun to watch as the loony Kilgore. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that is so pervasive in pop culture by now (most know several choice lines from the film  'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' et al) but I knew little enough about it that there were plenty of surprises left to experience. I have not seen the original cut of 'Apocalypse Now' so I cannot compare it to this newer cut  but this is a film that should most certainly be experienced. 8/10<br /><br />--Shelly,positive
During the final throes of the Vitnam war  our central character  Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) is dispatched by the CIA on an illegal one-man mission to assassinate a renegade US Marine commander  Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando)  who has allegedly gone 'completely insane'  but who is successfully waging a private cross-border war from his base in Cambodia  a neutral and therefore off-limits country.<br /><br />The entire narrated story of what Willard sees and does as he is ferried up the Da Nang river by an undisciplined and terrorised navy patrol boat crew to murder Kurtz is a grand metaphor for the excesses  decadence and ultimately the weakness of the Anglo-Saxon psyche: If we don't understand something  and we are unable to control it  exterminate it. Kurtz had eventually come to know this.<br /><br />Unless you pay complete attention to every emotional gesture  to every word of the dialogue between the protagonists  especially in the scene where the two of them are alone in Kurtz's darkened lair  you will miss one of the central themes of this incredible movie. Kurtz's subtle deal with his executioner  his unilateral 'surrender' in return for Willard agreeing (did he nod?) to tell Kurtz's 'son' (another metaphor for us  the next generation  the ones watching the movie) the truth about all the horrors that they had both seen in Vietnam  is mind-expanding stuff.The bonding between the two men whilst Kurtz cross-examines Willard --interlaced with some of his own horror stories  is incredible  nay  genius  film. The closing (intercut)scene of the ritual slaughter of a sacrificial bull is the single most powerful of symbols. Coppolla has made  intentionally or not  the ultimate anti-war statement  one that should resonate through the ages.,positive
As I peruse through the hundreds of comments that loyal readers of the IMDB have posted on this film  I find it very interesting how few  middle of the road comments there are. Everyone either loves it  or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now approximately 30 times  and having recently dissected it on DVD (how did we ever live without those magical digital machines?????)  I can say without hesitation that I am one of those who have a very special place in my heart for this film. Why would you like a film that's so confusing? ask many of my associates. The answer is this: Forget the war  forget the brutality....This is a classic story of society protecting itself from those that refuse to fall in line with the status quo. Brando represents the individual that has his own way of getting the job done. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job  he does it too well  without adhering to the accepted standards of death and destruction (Am I the only one who's troubled by the fact that we have 'standards' for death and destruction????)  so they send the Conformity Police out to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm....Draw any parallels between this and things you see every day? With the deepest respect to Mr. Coppola  whom I believe is one of the best directors of all time  I think he transcended his original intent of the movie  and probably didn't even realize it until after the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that permeates the entire movie has way too much to it to have been planned and portrayed; instead  it seems to have 'grown' itself  like some wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I must reiterate: I think FF Coppola did a bang-up job on this entire production  as did the cast and crew  but the sum of the movie exceeds the individual efforts ten-fold. So if you haven't seen the movie  rent it  watch it  then watch it again  and maybe a few more times  and look for all the generic parallels to everyday life. Only then make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you that have seen it  watch it again with the mindset previously described. I think you may just have a whole new appreciation for the film. Or maybe not! No matter whether you love it or hate it  be sure and give credit to Coppola for his masterful story-telling style!,positive
I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time . I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it <br /><br />This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound   editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted   and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border <br /><br />How about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director   I said  was  in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head   but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen   but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes   so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states  This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam  he's right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970 ) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of America <br /><br />It's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party   or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars   though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novel<br /><br />My all time favourite movie and it's very fitting that I chose this movie to be my one thousandth review at the IMDb,positive
My favourite movie of all time. This was a flawed piece of work by Coppola and seeing the documentary 'Heart of Darkness' made it even more compelling. Coppola at this point was king of Hollywood after making 'the Godfather' and 'GodfatherII' and had developed the ego necessary to even dare try to make a movie like 'Apocalypse Now'. Through sheer arrogance he went to the Phillipines with a partial script and thought he would know what he would do when he got there. Just as Captain Willard thought he would know what to do once he got to Col. Kurtz's compound. And just like Willard  he DIDN'T know what he was going to do once he got there. This is such a masterpiece of American cinema  beautifully photographed and the river is such a perfect metaphor and backdrop for the story. What I like most about 'Apocalypse Now' is that it offers no answers or conclusions. Consequently  because of this open-endedness  it infuriates some viewers who like their movies to be much more obvious. <br /><br />This movie defies categorization. Some call it a war movie which it isn't at all  really it is more of a personal study of man. The best pic about Vietnam is 'Platoon' in my opinion and if a viewer is seeking a retelling of the Vietnam War go there first for answers. <br /><br />Coppola should be commended for his take on the bureaucracy of war which he conveys quite effectively with the meeting with Gen.Corman and Lucas (Harrison Ford) and the Playmate review. The sheer audacity of Kilgore makes him an unforgettable character and the dawn attack will always be a Hollywood classic.<br /><br />It is an almost psychedelic cruise to a very surreal ending which makes it a movie not accessible to everyone. Very challenging to watch but rewarding as well. I could offer my explanations on each scene but that would be totally pointless. This movie is intended for interpretation and contemplation as opposed to immediate gratification.<br /><br />A little footnote  definitely if your a first-time viewer of Apocalypse Now  watch the original version first  the 'Redux' version is  I think  more intended for the hardcore fan and is more of a curiosity than a 'new and improved' version of the movie,positive
Touching Bollywood epic melodrama about a 10 year-old girl who finds out that she's adopted  and is determined to find her birth mother. The film's major success is the performance of P.S. Keerthana  who plays the girl. The first half of the film is very good. There are a few really good songs  too  especially the number that introduces the protagonist. Unfortunately  the film's second half  which takes place in war-torn Sri Lanka  feels like an entirely different  and disappointing movie. It's big on explosions and special effects  with Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels dodging grenades  running from fireballs  and being yanked by stunt wires. All the film can offer as insight are cheap platitudes like  Some day there must come peace and Perhaps the children will find a way. The final sequence  where the daughter and mother are reunited  is good  but so over-the-top with the music and a well-timed downpour that it feels like a cheat. I know  I know  it's all in the style of Bollywood. But this is a story where big moments simply detract from the simple  powerful central story. Bollywood could certainly use a little restraint at times  too.,positive
LACKAWANNA BLUES is a fine stage play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and an even finer film as the author adapted his own life story for the screen. This brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors  fine music  brilliant editing  superb direction by George C. Wolfe  and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory! Yes  it is just that good.<br /><br />The story is based on the author's life as the child 'Junior' (Marcus Carl Franklin) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic Rachel Nanny Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson)  a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the South  from mental hospitals  and from the streets to Lackawanna  New York. The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by Nanny. The myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business: Terrence Howard  Rosie Perez  Mos Def  the beautiful Carmen Ejogo  Louis Gossett Jr.  Jeffrey Wright  Ernie Hudson  Charlayne Woodward  Jimmy Smits  Patricia Wettig  Macy Gray  Liev Schreiber  Kathleen Chalfant  Lou Myers  Hill Harper - the list goes on and on.<br /><br />In the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism  the history of desegregation  the dynamics of drug abuse and violence  the infectious joy of African American music contributions to our musical culture  and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. S. Epatha Merkerson is wholly submerged in this role  a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. She offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years  and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an HBO movie  she without a doubt would add the Oscar to place along side her Golden Globe award.<br /><br />The entire cast is exceptional and Wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece  he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues  jazz  dancing  and joy. The production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story. Highly Recommended  almost Compulsory Viewing! Grady Harp,positive
Recently had the pleasure of seeing this emotionally charged film by Director Mani Ratnam at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. I have bestowed my highest honour of the Film Festival on this feature. Make sure that you do not let an opportunity to experience this cinematic gem pass you by ... but be forewarded: this film will make you shed a tear if you belong to the species known as homo sapien! A 10 !!,positive
Last night  I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK (KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles). Oddly  it was 137 minutes long--slightly longer than the time listed on IMDb.<br /><br />At first  I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me. The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it. At the beginning  a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding  war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated. Months later  the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India. At a refugee center  you see the lady about to give birth--after which the titles to the film finally are revealed.<br /><br />The entire focus of the film then changes completely--to a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras  India. You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family. None of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missing--what about the lady who was about to give birth? My wife and I debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film. Somehow or another  she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad #2--though she did NOT realize these people were not her biological parents.<br /><br />Soon after this  the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots (one of the complaints I had about the film)  as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage AND tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused. Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way  the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother. Seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents (particularly the adoptive mother) was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interest.<br /><br />Unfortunately  Sri Lanka has been involved in a very  very long and brutal civil war with Tamilese militants  off and on  for three decades. The family's decision to look for the mom back in Sri Lanka was indeed noble  but also a bit stupid at times--as they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war! This was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parents--first you tell her she ISN'T your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a WAR ZONE!!! Sure  the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother  but this really was stupid in hind sight. If it were me  I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kid--thus avoiding being in the middle of a war!<br /><br />Despite my complaints  the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding. Far from perfect  it sure hits an emotional home run. Also  while I expected this because I have seen several Indian films  many Westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no where--this IS standard in most films from India--including those made in Bollywood (Bombay) and Tamilwood/Kollywood (Madras).,positive
It pays to watch Reader's Digest. Or Time  if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration to Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adopted girl who goes in search of her biological parents  Mr. Ratnam paints a classic that rivets as much as it rebukes  cherishes as much as it chastens and preaches as much as it practises.<br /><br />Where does one start? The foreboding gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family headed by a firebrand engineer-author and 3 adorably naughty children? Or that murky region where reality crosses the point of providing a comfortable existence and becomes a monster of incredulous and sinister events and ideologies? Whichever way one looks at it  this film is worth being in your collection  if you happen to like Mani Ratnam's compelling dramas.<br /><br />Mr. Ratnam is a past master in blending fictional tales within real life incidents and in this film  he oozes class in adapting two real-life stories into one. I will not go into the story as it is better seen than read. But  what I will dwell upon is the impact it had upon me and why  for all the war-mongering that happens in this world  it cannot destroy that simple yet inexhaustible force called hope.<br /><br />Innocence  in its purity  cannot fathom the complex desires of adult decadence and greed. Nor does it recognize perils when it is accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what it wants. It is an innocence of such nature that drives Amudha to seek her biological parents  despite warnings that they could be lost in the cauldron of civil war. Having survived a terrorizing experience of conversing with a physically challenged man only to realize that he is a more lethal entity in disguise  Amudha sticks to her cause in a manner that tears down her well-wishers' resistance. And finally  when the twain do meet  mother and daughter  the reunion is so taut with emotion that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears. Aided by a coruscating background score from A R Rahman  the scene that follows is poignant to melt even the stoniest of hearts: a list of questions that Amudha has to ask her biological mother. In a culmination as dramatic as the sequence of incidents leading to it  a child discovers its mother  alive in body but lost in spirit. With the crushing realization that she has no hope of staying with the one who bore her  Amudha does to her adoptive mother what this film's title means: a peck on the cheek.<br /><br />As for the cast  the trail is clearly blazed by the brilliant PS Keerthana. Mr. Ratnam has a gift of extracting spectacular performances from little-known child artistes  but this should take nothing away from Keerthana for an award-winning performance. With an able supporting cast of Madhavan (Thiru)  Simran (Indira) and the stupendous Nandita Das (Shyama)  she embellishes the scenes in almost every frame she is in. The music may be not as memorable as other Rahman offerings but that still didn't stop him from garnering another National Award for the best music direction. Vellai Pookal is as much an ode for the need to cherish human life as it is for nature. The dialogues are top-class (sample the touching exchange Amudha and Indira have on the swing  shortly after the revelation that she is not Indira's biological daughter) and the cinematography  superb.<br /><br />This film is a clear statement to drop arms as much as it is to respect human life and expressions. Do not judge it as a lesson in film-making; you will only lose out on experiencing one of the very best from the Mani Ratnam-A R Rahman stable.,positive
Mani sir as usual brings out another amazing story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such an amazing relationship between parents and child is brought out in a beautiful fashion. Mani Sir as usual without much special effects and not much outdoor shoots.(In fact this was the only movie where he went outside India ever..that too just to sri lanka).Mani's class is written all over the movie...and to add to it ARR's music..which is just amazing...Vellai Pookal is one of my most fav songs ever... Maddy who is what he is in the film industry has impressed a lot too. Starting from alaipayuthey  to kannathil to ayutha ezuthu to guru.. Mani ratnam has showed to the world what a versatile actor Maddy is. Simran has been really good too. She has showed that she can act too in non-glamorous and character roles. In all an amazing movie. Sad that the tamil public could not appreciate this gr8 movie and it bombed at the box-office....,positive
This film is absolute gold. If you haven't seen it  do. Mani Ratnam outdoes himself once again. This film introduced me to Nandita Das as well  though everyone shines in this movie. My only regret is I've never found a copy with subtitles to the lyrics of the songs. We are led from the jungle of northern Sri Lanka to the serene beaches of Southern India  as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by love of the human heart. Beautiful  subtle  witty  with a few hidden surprises waiting for the viewer  this movie stands up to being seen again and again  and the story within the story  The Umbrella  is done so well  as we watch the scene unfold from drawings in a book. Lovely. Watch it.,positive
I have seen this movie when it was released and no doubt it is heart touching. I liked the point of view of a kid who came to know that what she was thinking about her were actually not true. It's a shatter to that small kid. And her search to find out who she is. And before and after she knows about her  the relationship between her and her foster-mom. That's a nice view. A R Rahman adds his stress by a good re-recording and songs. In this movie mani ratnam does not exaggerate or give advices (like in Vuyire) but simply narrates the characters as they are . And because of that the film exactly strikes the audience. The pool bath scene of chakkarvarthy and nandhitadas did not convey perfectly what it meant for. Mani Ratnam has amazingly improved.,positive
When you want to celebrate life and love  especially for precious little daughters  you have to shout it from the countryside. And what gorgeous countrysides! There are so many tears of joy even God joins in. See this movie.<br /><br />,positive
Kannathil Muthamittal is for sure a great movie. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a great directing job and A.R. Rahman for great songs. The camera work is just excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for Best Foreign Film or even Best Camera Work.,positive
Hello all! I went to this movie without any expectation though I knew Maniratnam would've given an excellent film! I was stunned!! The backdrop is the struggle between the tamils settled in Sri Lanka and the government. The story is about how an young girl Amudha who lives with her foster parents at Chennai  India leaves to Sri Lanka in search of her real mother. The high points of the film are the performances of every actor and actress and ofcourse  the cinematography  editing and all other technical details. Full marks to the cast and crew. I have to mention about the cinematography as it brings out the war in such a way that you feel yourself being there. Excellent work! Though the war sequences reminded me of Saving Private Ryan  such a work was never attempted on Indian Screen. Overall the movie is great! And hats off to Mr.Maniratnam.<br /><br />Mani Ratnam has once again proved that he is a director who can take Indian cinema to great heights! I would love to watch this film again and again. An excellent film and a must see.,positive
To tell you the truth  I do not speak Tamil  and I did not understand the film. My good Tamil friend  Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow  what a long name)  explained every thing to me. What a great movie!!! After watching this movie  I felt I should have watched many more movies from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry). The war scenes were amazing  camera work excellent  and plot beautiful. The actress Simran  what a beauty. Give her an award for best looking someone. Ding  Ding  Ding  come on I smell a OSCAR winner. I didnt understand the songs  but they were excellent. Mani Ratnam is a great director  and I hope his next film was a success.,positive
You don't have to be a tamilian to appreciate this gem of a movie.I don't know a word of tamil and saw this movie only because a friend had recommended it to me.Understanding a movie without knowing the language is quite tough but I could make out the story because the lead actors (and actresses)emoted really well.And the little girl was really cute (she wasn't irritating like child actors in most hindi movies).The story is really touching and hats off to Mr. Ratnam for trying something different.The relationship between the parents and their children are shown quite realistically.(I could identify with the characters in the movie).It was alltogether a movie that will remain in my heart forever and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my friends.Also the songs are just out of this world!They were beautifully and meaningfully picturised.If only I could understand the right meaning of the lyrics:(,positive
I think this is one of the best tamil movies i've seen in a while. i love the fact that it doesn't revolve around a guy and girl falling in love and they made the movie brilliantly. The cast did a great job and i especially congratulate the litte girl. She was brilliant and really brought out the feeling of an adopted child searching for her real mother. Best of all are the songs  beautiful music and moving lyrics. There are some great songs in this move ya'll! especially 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'. Great songs  both of them. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a good cry and some great acting (and superb songs! ). Cheers Simran.,positive
When I stepped into the theater  I thought this was going to be a great movie. And I was not disappointed one bit. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt through out the whole movie are extraordinary! Great acting by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. This might most probably be the best Tamil movie I've seen in ages. Mani Ratnam has yet again proved that he is the best in making meaningful and heartfelt movies.<br /><br />This movie is basically about a young girl (P.S. Keerthana) who is in search of her biological mother (Nandita Das) who abandoned her in a refugee camp to fight for her country just like her husband (J.D. Chakravathy). A young novelist (Madhavan) finds out about this young girl's story and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to adopt this young child but one day she finds out that they are not her real parents and decides to search for her biological mother.<br /><br />This movie really screams EXCELLENT. The way Mani Ratnam presented the movie is magnificent. <br /><br />My Rating - 10/10,positive
This is an incredible movie that begins slowly. It leads you along in thinking of it as a typical maudlin family drama. Then  in the second half  there is a plot twist that utterly transforms this into a profound tale of global scope.<br /><br />If you are unaccustomed to films from India  with song and dance routines seemingly grafted on for no reason  stick with this movie. Especially beginning with the second half  you will find this movie an amazing experience.<br /><br />*********** Minor Spoiler Here ************* I have but one complaint with the movie. The dialog at the end (between Amudha and MDS) seemed very weak and missed the opportunity to bring in the war as a force that transforms people's lives. It was implied all along  but there should have been something about the importance of the struggle for MDS.,positive
One more classic performance by Maniratnam and his team. They can be proud to show this movie at all film festivals for it has got everything that needs to name it as an all time classic. The war and its impacts in Sri Lanka through the eyes of a ten year old girl is the movie all about but the scenes and circumstances will surely be not the one that you will expect. Madhavan no wonder he is one of the best actors in the country who can always add beauty and unique identity for the role he plays  and it needs real daringness to act as a father for three kids when he is considered as a dream boy with a glamorous personality in the industry. Music by AR Rahman makes the movie a special one for those who love melodies. Above all the story and the way it is told makes it as the best movie in the recent times.,positive
Mani is back wit a Rathnam(gem) he manages to capture the mental trauma of a small girl searching 4 her mother they way he goes about showing the problems-in Ceylon is a treat.. .. Tis movie is a must watch.the musical score does enhance the viewing pleasure.. Rahman a find of Rathnam has given some great tunes the lyrics r apt 4 the movie the locations used for the movie are very good and makes viewing pleasant the movie starts of in a light manner moves over to capture the feelings of the girl finally goes on o shed light into the life of people in war torn places across the world this is yet another classic from ManiRathnam,positive
I finally snagged a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal through Netflix and spent New Yera's Eve watching an amazing drama unfold. It began with Shyama (a winsome Nandita Das) getting married to Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then a war takes over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she gives birth to a child. Several years later we see Amudha  a playful well-loved child (P. S. Keerthana)  who is the darling (or burden) of teachers  parents and fellow schoolmates alike  in a very How to Solve a Problem Like Maria sequence. On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she is not their biological child  she was adopted. This tilts her confident love-filled world and she constantly dwells on why her birth mother left her. Several attempts at truancy later the adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try to find her birth mother. The country is torn asunder by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught up in the mess. But this also leads to their meeting the new Shyama - one who finally is confronted by Amudha and asked why she abandoned her daughter.<br /><br />The story of a child who has to grapple with the fact that she was abandoned at birth  her obsessive drive to reconnect with her birth mother  the unconditional love of the adoptive parents  the demons that drive the birth mother  the normalcy of Chennai and the horrors of terrorism ravaged Sri Lanka - Mani Ratnam made a masterful film that blended many ingredients into a saga that is soul stirring. AR Rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and the poignant moments in the film. The film has excellent performances from Madhavan  Nandita Das  Simran and an absolute stunner role as Amudha - the abandoned one - done by the child artiste P. S. Keerthana. This performance won her a National award.<br /><br />The cinematography is visual poetry - each frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot. I am intrigued by the connection Mani Ratnam has with terrorism  love and obsessions. I think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding. Mahadevan's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish  rather was well matched with how much he cared for the little girl. His one liners were hilarious. The mother played by Simran was also quite multi-dimensional - she was idealistic  loved the adopted daughter but also worried about her biological kids. The shock  angst  and obsession of the child Amudha was outstandingly portrayed by P. S. Keerthana. Her wide accusing eyes did most of the talking. In fact the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das  and her husband. Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious so as to not give us overt ideas of why they were the way they were - the enigma of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes. It also kept him from being judgmental - this was another conflict in which he took no sides but merely reported while showing the human tragedy.<br /><br />Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul stirring drama - I rarely weep in the movies  but this one left me moist eyed and a little heartsick. This is a beautiful film - a treasure and a keeper if you can find a copy; beg borrow or steal one today and watch the film!,positive
Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through. It details the life of a strong woman by the name of Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is referred to as Nanny by all who know her  but she could have just as easily been called Wonder Woman. She epitomized strength  will power  confidence and resolve. She owned a home that she used to house just about every type of person that society would reject. Her tenants consisted of a lesbian  a psychotic war veteran  an amputee  and a host of other vagrants that made the home miles away from ordinary. Each successive event Rachel took in stride and handled flawlessly. She wasn't a dictator devoid of compassion  but in fact she was quite the opposite. She displayed compassion almost to a fault by giving shelter and refuge to so many that she seemed to over-extend herself.<br /><br />Merkerson did a good job  but I believe this role was right up her alley anyway. The movie had an even keel never straying from Rachel. There were of course dramatic moments but they were to be expected. Nothing was ever to shocking or profound other than Rachel herself.,positive
The Director of Kannathil Muthamittal directed the first Indian film I had seen Dil Se which led me down the path of buying well over 122 Hindi DVDs in the<br /><br />course of four months. I can say I understood the total attraction  I was<br /><br />somehow confused as to why the film would stop for music videos. It was an excellent movie  I didn't know what to make of the dancing and the female<br /><br />vocals were a bit shrill for my western ears  but somehow I found AR Rahmen's score hypnotic. I bought the soundtrack the following day and then Lagan  Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G the following week and with the exception of Ichi the<br /><br />killer a few other Korean films   I can't be bothered to watch much else. Kind of strange for someone who has only watched a strict diet of Hong Kong  Horror<br /><br />and Action/Science fiction films for the past 30 years.<br /><br />But I should get back to Kannathil Muthamittal  It is one of the Mani Ratman's latest efforts and I laughed  Cried  Got totally mad  terrified and most of all I didn't feel manipulated. The acting was superb  the photography was beautiful  I think you could stop the movie at any given time and would notice that any give frame would be worthy of painting. The music fit the movie perfectly and after the<br /><br />credits rolled  I wanted to watch again... so I did.<br /><br />It would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you may miss the pleasure of watching the events unfold and the characters develop. This is what great film is all about! I stood and applauded in my home theater when it was over!<br /><br />My wife is watching now  and I can't wait for her reaction  I can't expect it will be anything less than mine.,positive
This movie was astonishing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary  and the acting spectacular. At first I thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary  but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie  it struck me that I was dead wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie  and despite this  I must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! No  the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been  but the plot is what really gets you. American or Asain  I would recommend this to anyone--and I have now. I guarantee that after seeing this one  you'll get the best out of it  and its plot. I hope you feel the same  and write a rave review too!,positive
Kannathil Muthamittal was simply one of the most touching and sincere movies ive seen in a long time. the story of an adopted girl who on her 9th birthday learns the truth about her parentage. she sets out in an endeavour to find out more about her real mother and learns that her mother is now a terrorist.<br /><br />the greatness of the movie lies in its simplicity. mani ratnam generally has a tendency to create unreal and pompous overblown characters in this movie  every person seems real and their interactions are touching and sincere. this is the reason why this ranks as one of his best movies.<br /><br />the movie is emotionally draining and tugs at the heart of the viewer  keerthana as the 9 year old amudha and simran as her adopted mother are simply brilliant. their relationship is the cornerstone of this movie. there are some notable flaws here  particularly the scene where amudha learns that she is an adopted child is jarring and seems totally unreal. it is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would break such a news in the manner that they did. another flaw is  surprisingly enough  the brilliant songs. they again seem forced and stand out  not gelling with the rest of the script.<br /><br />having said these  this still is one of the most poignant and beautiful movies to come out of india in a long long time. this beauty is not just in the script or characters but in teh technical brilliance as well  ravi chandran's camera work is sheer poetry. all characters perform creditably and the realistic humour  especially in teh flashback scenes are entertaining.<br /><br />a sincere 9!!,positive
In Sri Lanka  a country divided by religion and language  the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)  a separatist organization  has claimed an estimated 68 000 lives since 1983. Human rights groups have said that  as a result of the war  more than one million people have been displaced  homeless or living in camps. The impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film A Peck on the Cheek  winner of several awards at the National Film Awards in India. While the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl's voyage of discovery  the human cost of war is made quite clear and Ratnam gives the fighting a universal context  pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing.<br /><br />Beautifully photographed in Southern India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of Sri Lanka  the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in Sri Lanka. Played with deep feeling and expressiveness by P.S. Keerthana in a memorable performance  Amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama (Nandita Das) and Dileepan (J.D. Chakravarthi) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out  leaving her in a Red Cross camp. In a loving flashback  we see Amudha's adoptive parents  father Thiru (Madhavan) a prominent Tamil writer  and mother Indra (Simran) a TV personality  marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl.<br /><br />Young Amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday  according to the parents' prior agreement. While she is playing  Thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that you are not our daughter and the response is predictable. Distraught  she questions who her father was  what her mother's name was  why she gave her up  and so forth but few answers are forthcoming. Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother  now a fighter for the Tamil separatists. The family's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions  handled mostly with skill by Ratnam  though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish.<br /><br />A Peck on the Cheek is of course a Bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama. The melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors; however  I found the musical dramatizations of songs by A. R. Rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick  high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing. Yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film's limitations. Tamil cinema has been criticized by many  even within the country as being too clichéd and commercial  yet A Peck on the Cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues. That it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute.,positive
I am a big follower of Indian Movies especially Malayalam and Tamil.<br /><br />Shame on India for not sending this movie as their official Oscar entry. I have seen this movie and it has clearly revealed to me the maturity Tamil cinema has in its screenplay and narrative which bollywood better catch up with.By the way to all we westerners  Tamil Cinema is more qualitative and very different from Bollywood which is all about good looks glamour and promotion.<br /><br />Coming to the point what was India thinking when they sent a movie like 'Devdas' to the Oscars? That was a really a Masochist move. I think they are trying to punish Oscar judges with boredom by sending Devdas since the judges toppled Lagaan last year.<br /><br />'Devdas' is just a brigthly colored but stale and predictable melodrama of Love  fate and destiny. I would keep away from it. Anyway  not sending a movie like Kanathil Muthital shows how much of a revamp Indian administration needs to save them from poor administrators who lack intelligence. Now I know why this country has so many issues. They are heavily talented but not showcased properly.,positive
Sri Lanka... not a country I've ever given much thought to  I have to admit. I didn't even know it was near India  let alone that there has been a bloody civil war going on there since 1983. It seems that the rebels of the Tamil minority have been in an ongoing conflict with the military regime that runs the country for many years  causing many deaths and widespread suffering on the island.<br /><br />Mani Ratman's latest film  A PECK ON THE CHEEK  tells the story of a young girl named Amudha  who is separated from her Sri Lankan parents by the war and raised by a young Indian couple. Amudha is a bright and mischievous girl  whose life is turned upside down when her parents tell her that she was adopted as a child. Although her adopted parents love her as much as could be  and have raised her without prejudice along with their biological children  Amudha cannot help but want to learn more about her biological family.<br /><br />Mani Ratman is probably best known for his 1998 film DIL SE  which hides a story about terrorism and politics inside a love story (or is it the other way around?). A PECK ON THE CHEEK inhabits similar territory  but is perhaps more ambitious in the ground it covers. The central theme that binds the movie is of love between all the various members of a family  and especially that between a child and her adopted parents. It's a pretty honest and open look at feelings  that can be extremely touching and heartwarming at some times and quite painful at others. It's an emotionally complex film  with characters that are somewhat idealised but still behave in a very human way.<br /><br />The film revolves around 9 year old Amudha  played with charm and vivaciousness by young actress P.S. Keerthana in her first and only acting role. She's a princess and a monster  always getting into trouble but so disarmingly charming nobody can stay mad at her for long. The young actress is perfectly cast for the role  and does a tremendous job in the various and often difficult emotional scenes required of her.<br /><br />A PECK ON THE CHEEK has such an innocent name I was quite unprepared for the intensity of the experience. Never has such a small act come with such an enormous emotional impact  I dare say. The film is a bold and artistic effort to explore issues that are not frequently covered on the silver screen.<br /><br />Mani Ratman's direction is superb  very confident and mature - the most sophisticated work I've seen from this director yet. The film is visually very stylish  with some excellent camerawork and imagery. A.R. Rahman provides the film's soundtrack  which is not as good as his classic DIL SE or BOMBAY music (based on first impressions at least) but still shows his great musical talent.<br /><br />I'm not aware of a DVD release for the film yet - I saw it in Tamil with English subtitles thanks to the San Francisco International Film Festival  of which the film was undoubtedly the highlight. The production is a truly world class effort  and I am sure it will be popular with western audiences as it begins to receive wider exposure.<br /><br />Recommended.,positive
I saw this film at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival.<br /><br />This is the first Indian film I've seen in the Tamil language  and while it does share some similarities with other Indian films (wonderful music and choreography  sweeping storyline)  the director attempts more than just to entertain. The film tells the story of Amudha  a precocious nine-year old whose parents reveal to her that she was adopted  thus beginning an odyssey that takes them all from India to war-torn Sri Lanka. Gorgeous visuals mix with horrifying scenes of violence expressly to make a point  though it is a simplistic one. Amudha is played by P.S. Keerthana  and she is one of the few child actors I've seen who can be precocious and yet not annoying. Her charm and beauty held the film together.,positive
Reanhauer (Bill Roy) is the leader of a desert-dwelling cult who tries to resurrect one of his people  only to have a heart attack himself! He ends up dying on an operating table  and for the sake of revenge  his spirit takes over the body of the title character (Jill Jacobson)  who then proceeds to go about hacking and slashing until her fellow nurses learn what needs to be done to exorcise the demon.<br /><br />While I know enough about the directors' filmography to know that it primarily consists of outright schlock  Nurse Sherri is really not all that bad. Sure  it's clear that this was very low-budget stuff  yet all that I found egregiously cheesy about it were the visual effects. The acting is not as bad as one might expect  either.<br /><br />There are two different versions available of this on DVD. A much more sex-oriented version featuring bountiful amounts of T & A is the original cut  with such hilariously silly vignettes as the victim and and her love interest sharing their strangest sex moments  including one involving fellatio during a college lecture!<br /><br />The movie would then be re-cut for theatrical version with the horror elements emphasized more strongly. Some scenes are dropped with new ones added (with Stevens  the role played by J.C. Wells  expanded). The movies' most memorable sequence in this cut is a scene in a foundry  and it works quite well. This cut of the movie is more interesting overall; I would recommend that a viewer see them both and compare them.<br /><br />Both versions hit their stride in the final third  and benefit from a marvelously scene-stealing performance from Bill Roy as the crazed Reanhauer  and a moody climax set in a graveyard (although actually filmed in Adamsons' backyard!). Marilyn Joi is also worth mentioning as the cute nurse who is attracted to football player turned patient Marcus Washington (Prentiss Moulden)  who's lost his eyes in a car accident  and who incidentally is key to resolving the story with his knowledge of voodoo rituals. The movie also makes amusing use of music from composer Harry Lubins' personal collection  including compositions for such TV series as 'One Step Beyond' and 'The Outer Limits'.<br /><br />Nurse Sherri (known by more alternate titles (including Beyond the Living and Hospital of Terror) than any other Adamson movie) is actually fairly entertaining low-budget fare. I ended up having a good time watching it.<br /><br />7/10,positive
''Meet Sherri..for an evening of Pleasure and Terror!'' Cheap special effects cheesy lines yep its the original 1978 Movie ''Nurse Sherri'' Starting Geoffrey Land as Peter Desmond and Jill Jacobson as Sherri Martin and Directed by Al Adamson.<br /><br />The movie is about an evil ancient spirit that possesses a nurse at a hospital then she starts killing doctors one by one.The acting was okay but some of the acting was robotic.The storyline was good but the sex scenes were just thrown in there probably to get more views.The directing was bad And the special effects looked like a drawing the effects didn't fool anybody.the death scenes were pretty good but the director mixed too many things in there that didn't make any sense like the sex scenes the nudity the football player and many more.<br /><br />Overall Its A Good Movie But Not The Best.<br /><br />7 Out Of 10,positive
I love just about everything the late Al Adamson directed in his long and varied career  but The Possession of Nurse Sherri stands head and shoulders above fun yet admittedly grade-Z schlockfests like Horror of the Blood Monsters and Dracula Vs. Frankenstein. This film is actually scary! Am I saying that you're going to jump out of your seat when you watch Nurse Sherri? No  of course not. But this pastiche of elements from The Exorcist  Ruby  and Carrie is one of those nice  eerie little horror movies common to the seventies. You can't put your finger on what's so spooky about it  but the film drips with atmosphere. (And what an ending! Don't worry  I won't spoil it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really nailed it with this one  and it doesn't matter whether Nurse Sherri was a calculated success or a happy accident. Jill Jacobson is likable but not outstanding as the hapless nurse who becomes possessed by the spirit of a recently deceased cult leader (Bill Roy  who shines in his brief role). Geoffrey Land is okay as her surly doctor boyfriend. There are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the bottom line with these cheap drive-in flicks  after all) but they actually contribute to the plot rather than just being window dressing. Nurse Sherri was a Poverty Row production  and it shows at times (sets  special effects  etc.). Still  the film has heart  mostly decent acting and direction  and some genuine chills. Sam Sherman also saw fit to use Harry Lubin's theme music for the late '50s/early '60s television series One Step Beyond in this film  which certainly adds to the creepy atmosphere. The DVD contains two significantly different cuts of the movie (the early version features a lot of T&A that wound up on the cutting room floor to make way for more horrific stuff) as well as the theatrical trailer  the TV spot  and a great commentary by Sherman. Does anybody know whatever happened to Bill Roy  by the way? Next to John Carradine  he's the best actor I've ever seen in an Al Adamson film  and he plays the cult leader like he means it.,positive
Lackawanna Blues is a touching story about Nanny  a woman who gives all of herself to help those in need. It's told from the viewpoint of a boy  taken in by Nanny when his own mother isn't quite up to the task.<br /><br />I have respect for this movie for three main reasons: 1) It is touching  but not sappy. It's told in a very real fashion  without a lot of the aggravating Hollywood storytelling baggage. And the ending is quite good (teary but not over-the-top).<br /><br />2) Although it's clearly an African-American film  being set in the post-segregation black community of Lackawanna  New York  it doesn't wear its ethnicity on its sleeve. The story stands on the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) surrounding their lives. It's not preachy  it's simply good.<br /><br />3) It has a great soundtrack (can't beat old-school R&B and Chicago blues).<br /><br />Generally the acting is strong  but not universally so. Some of the performances simply don't hold up to the characters the actors are supposed to portray. But considering it was a made-for-TV movie  that's to be expected.<br /><br />8 out of 10. Imperfect but likable  good film for a rainy day.,positive
This is one of those games where you love it to bits or hate it to shreds.Even being a hardcore Mario fan can make you dislike this game.You can hate it because it is 2 short and somewhat boring and easy.Or you can love it because it is a mixture of amazing graphics(not a Nintendo fan huge excitement) music or game play.I know a lot of people that say it is amazing and others who think its the worst Mario ever.It really depends on the type of Nintendo fan you are.I personally love this game and I think it is the best wii game but you should determine that for yourself.So I think you should absolutely get it if you are the right Nintendo fan.But If you love The classics too much you may not like it.So try it out yourself.,positive
Ever since 1981  Nintendo has been making great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas would get a bit boring after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem to get boring because they're always adding something new. It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear that there's a new version of the Wii scheduled for release in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that your actually doing something instead of just sitting on the couch pushing buttons. <br /><br />And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is to be released in 2010.,positive
(Warning: May Contain Spoilers) Let Rosalina help Mario lead the way and smile because this game will brighten your day. <br /><br />120 stars will require luck and skill  but 60 will bring you as much of a thrill!<br /><br />Blasting through stars show Mario and Luigi and what travelers they now are! <br /><br />Walking upside down has never been more fun  especially a final battle with Koopa near the Sun! <br /><br />This is truly a super awesome game and it absolutely deserves a place in Nintendo's Hall of Fame!,positive
Like some other people wrote  I'm a die-hard mario fan  and I loved this game. <br /><br />This game starts slightly boring  but trust me  it's worth it. As soon as you start  your hooked! The levels are fun and exiting. They will hook you 'till your mind turns to mush. I'm not kidding. This game is also orchestrated  and is beautifully done. <br /><br />To keep this spoiler free  I have to keep my mouth shut about details. But please try this game! It'll be worth it!<br /><br />Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's that good!) Hardness: 10 Attention Grabber: 10 Average: 10,positive
the mario series is back  and in my opinion  better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative mario yet; even more so than super mario 64. the controls are great; some of the best for the wii. beautiful graphical design as well. the levels are very big  and the good old bosses are back. there is tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of replay value. I only have 2 complaints: 1: the story is a little to similar to mario 64. and 2: the difficulty isn't very high; though it does require some patience. mario fans: the game you've been waiting for. Casual gamers: this game is more than worth the buy. 9.8 out of 10.,positive
*THIS COMMENT WILL PROBABLY HAVE SPOILERS!! I CHECKED THE SPOILERS BOX JUST IN CASE BUT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE SPOILERS  BUT BE AWARE ANYWAYS IF I SAY SOMETHING THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER A SPOILER AND I DON'T!* Wow...best game since Super Mario 64. I got this game the first day it came out  and before I got it  I went on some gaming websites to look at its ratings (yes  they already reviewed it before it came out)  and I was shocked. I was expecting something like Sunshine because lately all the Mario games have kind of been getting worse and worse. But this one totally beat the other games. The scores on this game even beat Halo 3! It's simply amazing.<br /><br />STORY: Not the best  Mario games are never known for their plots  and this one isn't really much of a difference. Bowser once again kidnaps Peach but this time invades the Mushroom Kingdom on a festival celebrated once every century and gets a flying saucer and it shoots lasers on the ground and then they put anchors inside the ground and rip off the castle and its foundation into outer space.<br /><br />GRAPHICS: Absolutely gorgeous  the best graphics on Wii so far. The water effects are really nice too  if you ever see the water  it looks so real because the effects they put in it.<br /><br />MUSIC: Simply amazing  the music in this game is orchestrated. Not all of it  but even the ones that aren't orchestrated still sound very nice.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY: Very entertaining  keeps you wanting to play more and more  and for me  since usually I tend to be very frustrated with games if I die a lot  I mean  I'm definitely not the only one  but this game for me didn't have that a lot. Now it still kind of did  but not to the point like Mario 64 where I totally go crazy and end up turning off the game because it made me mad  this one never did that.<br /><br />DIFFICULTY: There are two types of difficulty  because you can just technically beat the game with just 60 stars  which I think is kind of easy  but to beat the game 100%  you have to get 120  like always  and that quest is way harder  but at the same time still very fun.<br /><br />LENGTH: Good length  definitely not too short. It took me around 15-16 hours to beat it with just 60 stars  but 120 took me more like 45-50 hours. Now I didn't play it constantly that much  I played first a lot one day  then the next couple of days just a couple hours each day  then the next two days I played it all day. To me though  I think the quest for 60 stars was a tiny bit short  so if you want a long game  I suggest getting all of them.<br /><br />PRESENTATION: Now  the cinematic scenes in this movie are superb. The way they are  it just looks so much like something I would see in the theaters. They are hands down the best cinematic scenes on any Mario game so far.<br /><br />OVERALL: This game is definitely a great game  and I advise you to not wait until Christmas  get it as soon as possible. This game also is a good mixture of old and new  you'll have some sidescroller levels where you move just side to side  or up and down because they'll change on gravity  but even the music has some old classics in it. So this game seems to be like a masterpiece. To me  it's my favorite Mario game of all time  but others may disagree. But it's still a great game. I recommend every gamer who wants to have fun in a game to get this.,positive
I have been a Mario fan for as long as I can remember  I have very fond memories of playing Super Mario World as a kid  this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing Mario franchise. There is much very different about this game from any other Mario before it  while still keeping intact the greatest elements of Mario  the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space.<br /><br />The story begins much like any other Mario game  Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. Upon arriving at Peach's castle Mario finds Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attacking the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and then lifts her castle up into space. In the midst of the castle being lifted into space Mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talking star named Luma and is taken back to the Luma's home  a floating space station  here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader  a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser has taken away the space station's Power Stars and scattered them across the universe  it is up to Mario to help the Lumas find them and save Peach  thus the adventure begins.<br /><br />The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies  each galaxy consists of multiple planets that Mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the Power Stars. Mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity  some planets are small and others are big  many planets are similar to classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game are the controls  all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same  but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake the remote Mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game  and it will as well activate the shooting stars. You can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment. Then there is the graphics  these are by far the best graphics on the Wii  it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks  you could probably almost say it looks as good as some 360 games.<br /><br />My only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to  and also the story is pretty weak. The worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game  no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at 4 lives. Still these minor problems aside it's a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging. This is the type of game that we've been waiting for on the Wii.<br /><br />A perfect 10 out of 10!,positive
I saw what I believe to be the best Australian film of the year so far  Jon Hewitt's Acolytes.<br /><br />Acolytes is a stylish thriller with a killer premise. Get thistwo bullied and molested teens discover a local serial killer in their suburb AND then set about blackmailing him to kill the bully who molested them. Hewitt has picked a top notch cast including excellent new comers Sebastian Gregory  Josua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the teens. Add to that three  yes  thats right three great psycho's! Lead by Joel Edgerton in an outstanding performance of serial killer du jour  Belinda McClory his deranged spouse and Michael Dorman as the teen raping bully  with swastika tattoos. Once you add these teens and these menacing adults  all hell breaks loose Hewitt has crafted a balls to the wall serial thriller thats damn original and accomplished. You can see the influence of Larry Clark and David Lynch's Twin Peaks but Hewitt makes it all his own  in a Qld suburban back water  always ringing with the drones of emptiness. The script by Shayne Armstong  Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight.<br /><br />If marketed correctly this film could be a break out hit with teens. The next Wolf Creek? It could well be. It makes all the right moves. The teens are real ala Larry Clark. They don't suck and have an attached PC agenda  they are non communicative  good looking and hip. The killers are dark with real menace. Joel Edgerton steals his scenes as the mild mannered local Ted Bundy  who sports a butterfly on his 4WD spare ala John Fowles The Collector. Dorman's petrol head rapist pours on the menace that tops Suburban Mayhem and provides a creepy thug who you can't wait to see buy the farm.<br /><br />The film is fast paced  tough and brutal. Not only that  it displays a confidence and directorial mastery from Hewitt that is surely to win him an IF or AFI nomination  if not award! Its nuanced and poetic mise en scene  brilliant sound design  excellent cinematography and tight structure mark it as clearly one of the best directed Oz features I have seen so far this year.<br /><br />The film leaves you shaken  thinking and unsettled. Its a truly great edition to the return to genre going on in Australian cinema at present. It will surely garner the interest of Hollywood. Oh  and did I mention it got into Toronto? What other Oz feature films can say that much? The world should get ready for a new auteur  Jon Hewitt.,positive
I Would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment. I watched this not expecting too much from it. The Fact is that the cast were superb  Especially The lead Teen Female. The dark sides of them all came through  all were messed up in an not obvious way. There was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality. The serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children. What this movie is  is a strong drama/thriller. Yes I would agree they don't do the obvious  but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable. Also a decent dark ending  instead of which could have so easily been an opt out happy one. The attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also. I very good solid 7 out of 10. A little slow at times  but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from.,positive
"One of Chaplin's longest films up to that point  Burlesque on Carmen is a clever and surprisingly complex parody of what was then Prosper Merimee's well-known story about Carmen. I was a little confused about the difference between the IMDb's listing of the 1915 Burlesque on Carmen and the 1916 version. Based on the running time I assume that it was the 1915 version that I saw  since the 1916 one is a good 20 minutes longer  and from what I've read  those are 20 unnecessary and unimpressive minutes. <br /><br />From the very beginning  it's clear that Burlesque on Carmen is one of Chaplin's most complex and ambitious efforts to date  starting off with a long back story  told through inter-titles  about the tragic love story of Carmen. <br /><br />Carmen is sent by a band of gypsies (A band who put the GYP in gypsy.)  to seduce a Spanish officer so they can pull off their smuggling operation. It's a clever  Chaplinesque band of criminals  the leader of whom  Lillas Pastia  has spent 50 years learning to steal, thinking he might be offered a job in politics. <br /><br />On a side note  I've seen some almost misogynistic messages and jokes in some of Chaplin's earlier work  but probably none quite as overt as in this one. Near the beginning of the movie  as the band of gypsies are traveling  there is a scene where the mules and women are loading  and an inter-title explains that the mules are the ones with long ears. In case you couldn't tell  I guess. <br /><br />Chaplin plays the part of Don Jose  the hapless officer who is to be seduced by Carmen. He is described as a brave soldier and lover of women. Not exactly a stretch for Chaplin who removed any doubt about his ability to play a convincing comic soldier a few years later in the brilliant Shoulder Arms. And of course  he didn't have to act about being a lover of women.<br /><br />What is different here  of course  is his polished military uniform and straight-backed disciplinary manner  interspersed  of course  with some of his traditional slap-stick moves. He strikes me as a little guy in a position of authority  struggling to maintain the respect of his subordinates by exerting a gruff  stolid exterior.<br /><br />Soon Carmen enters (Loved by all men under the age of 96)  and she immediately begins flirting with Charlie. I should mention that for a good majority of the movie  it is surprisingly faithful to the original story  which was full of jealousy and tragedy. Chaplin is strangely convincing as a jealous lover  able to evoke a jealous passion that I've never seen from him. There's at least one scene where he is genuinely a little scary. <br /><br />Chaplin has some great sight gags in the movie  like a hilarious table dance and some classic sword fighting near the end. And his boyish charm and the role of a soldier is also definitely a winning combination  although there is another peculiar stunt involving a group of men pushing a huge door back and forth that wasn't very effective to begin with but just kept going on and on and on  probably about five times longer than it was worth. Although it was interesting that when it finally fell over it clearly was revealed as a movie prop. I always appreciate such glimpses at the old movie sets.<br /><br />The end of the film is it's strongest part. It bears striking resemblance to Romeo and Juliet  but just when you think that Chaplin is going to conduct a major thematic experiment by diverging distantly from his traditional style  there is a hilarious twist that is as vintage Chaplin as anything I've ever seen. Nice work!",positive
"Being the second last of Chaplin's Essanay films  CARMEN is a parody of Cecil B. Demille's drama with the same title. It stands as quite obvious that Demille's acknowledged film didn't impress the comedy king that much  which he later admitted in his autobiography.<br /><br />Parodies were not a new experiment for Chaplin. He had done several of them already  namely HIS PREHISTORIC PAST and HIS NEW JOB  and would continue to do so until the very end of his career in films (for instance in A KING IN NEW YORK).<br /><br />Chaplin does a very good portrayal of Don José  and Edna Purviance's is very as good as Carmen. Neither act as we are used to; Charlie is not the lovable Tramp and Edna is far from an innocent little woman  but that was not Chaplin's intentions  either. A BURLESQUE ON CARMEN is a somewhat odd Chaplin-film  very different  but includes good material nonetheless.<br /><br />The main story is  although very differently structured  as in the original drama. Don José is very much in love with Carmen  but is not alone in that field; Carmen, Carmen, (the) beautiful Carmen, (is) loved by all men under 96, but he has the big advantage that he is an officer  and there we are; this is the famous story about rivalry  love  greed and honor  seen from a humorous perspective. Thanks to Chaplin's and Purviance's performances  and to the wonderful  wonderful music by George Bizet which I highly admire  this could actually have been a near-comedy masterpiece  it's time taken into consideration. It could have been. But unfortunately  although it is a good pretty good comedy  I don't feel it's fair to blame people who claim that A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is far from being a masterpiece. But it's important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with any lack of talent  but rather a result of conflicts concerning business. When Chaplin refused to re-sign Essanay contract after completing his last film for the company  POLICE  they took revenge by editing back all the scenes Chaplin originally had edited out from CARMEN. Thanks to this  the film is somewhat confusing and has several pointless scenes which are more annoying than funny  and the film turned out to be rather a Ben Turpin-feature --Turpin played Remendados-- than a Chaplin-short. Naturally  Chaplin was in despair when he discovered what Essanay had done  and had to stay in bed for several days.<br /><br />Despite its obvious flaws  A BURLESQUE OF CARMEN is highly recommended to Chaplin-fans and to admirers of beautiful music.",positive
Every once in a while a film comes along with characters we all know and love. A film where you see people you know portrayed on screen. It's cinema very at its best.<br /><br />Lackawanna Blues is that film. Set in 1960s upstate New York  the story surrounds a rock- solid woman  who is the foundation for her community. This  based on a true story film  is told from a child she accepted as her own. This child  Ruben Santiago-Hudson wrote the screenplay.<br /><br />*Emmy winner  S. Epatha Merkerson stars as Nanny  a woman who has wit  drive and determination for helping others in her boarding home. She does this as she wrestles with infidelity from her young lover  Bill Crosby  played by the **Oscar nominated Terrence Howard. <br /><br />But make no mistake; see this film for the amazing performance of Merkerson  who is brilliant in this role. She encompasses a person we have all known  and perhaps love.<br /><br />Lackawanna Blues is already on DVD; be sure to pick it up at your local video story today.<br /><br />*Merkerson has already won an Emmy  Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild for this role.<br /><br />**Howard has an Oscar nomination for his role in Hustle & Flow.,positive
I just re-watched this thriller  one I had previously believed to be one of Hitch's lesser efforts. How wrong can you be! Maybe because I'm older  or maybe because the film gets better with every viewing  but now I think it's amazing. Every bit of suspense is wrung out of the tiniest detail  and that final scene on the merry-go-round is just breath-taking! Perfect in every way  highly recommended.,positive
The first murder scene is one of the best murders in film history(almost as good as the shower scene in Psycho) and the acting by Robert Walker is fantastic.A psychopath involved with tennis star in exchange murders.That´s the story and overall this film is very good but theres one problem:why dosen´t Guy Haines go to<br /><br />the cop in the first place.4/5,positive

This movie was fabulous. It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film. The directing and camera shots are nearly flawless(aside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand  clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like that.<br /><br /> I would rate Bruno as hitchcocks second most interesting character( of course bates is first). Robert Walker plays a very believable maniac. He didnt overact the part which made it believable(much the same how perkins didnt overact his part). Overall this is an excellent movie  an absolute must see for any hitchcock fans.<br /><br /> <br /><br />,positive
This is another one of Hitchcock's highest rated movies and rightfully so. This is a tale of two men who meet on a train and playfully exchange murder fantasies. One of them (Robert Walker) takes it seriously and this leads Guy Haines (Farley Granger) to trouble with the law. Another fast moving Hitchcock movie with lots of great scenes (the carousel scene and the tennis match are worthy of mentioning). Not a movie to be missed- it is a shame that no one will re-release this on DVD with loads of extras- just a cheap Warner Brothers DVD is all thats out there now.,positive
It's been said before--Strangers on a Train is Hitchcock's best movie--and he's made so many good ones! Like other Hitchcock  Strangers on a Train requires your full attention to really appreciate it  but once you can...you will.,positive
This is a well-crafted piece from everyone's favorite master of suspense. As usual  the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding (especially for the film's time). I did not find the first part of the film very exciting  but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like about this movie was the choice of Farley Granger for the part of Guy Haines. Somehow  I didn't find him very believable. On the other hand  Robert Walker shines as sinister 'bad guy' Bruno Anthony.<br /><br />Overall  I would highly recommend this.,positive
Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />Tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets the mysterious Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Soon afterwards  Guy finds himself drawn into the psychotic realm of Bruno's world. <br /><br />Guy is separated from his wife and is now involved with a senator's daughter. Guy is interested in entering into politics after he retires from tennis. Bruno wants to kill his own father but doesn't want to do it himself.<br /><br />Bruno proposes that he disposes with Guy's wife  while Guy's part of the deal is to eliminate Bruno's father. Guy dismisses this idea since he isn't interested in having his troublesome wife killed. <br /><br />Bruno goes ahead with his half of the proposal. While Guy becomes the prime suspect of his wife's murder. As law enforcement continues to investigate Guy  Bruno continues to torment Guy  wanting him to complete the other half of the proposal. <br /><br />'Strangers on a Train' has one of the most exciting endings of all Hitchcock movies.,positive
Has aged really well - still thrilling and suspenseful today. Certainly one of Hitch's best movies. Beautifully shot  with a great premise for suspense  sex-appeal provided by beautiful Ruth Roman. Because of the great premise  you feel like you have to watch it to the end. If you find yourself losing faith in Hitch and doubting his title as the Master of Suspense  i recommend this nice little movie as an antidote. 5 out of 5.,positive
LACKAWANNA BLUES is an entertaining  engrossing  emotionally-charged HBO-TV movie based on the childhood memories of actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson (who also appears in a small role). This joyous motion picture experience is centered around Santiago-Hudson's childhood guardian  Rachel Nanny Crosby  a strong  big-hearted black woman who ran a boarding house in upstate New York during the 1950's. Nanny was a one-woman social service organization whose boarding house was filled with drunks  derelicts  cripples  drug addicts  misfits  and everyone else in town who needed a hand-up instead of a hand-out. The crux of the story revolves around Nanny's relationship with young Ruben (beautifully played by Marcus Franklin) a boy whose divorced parents were unable to raise the boy properly so Nanny took him in. S. Epatha Merkeson  who has been wasted for years in the thankless role of Lieutenant Van Buren on NBC's LAW & ORDER  turns in a powerhouse performance as Nanny  the neighborhood mother-figure whose boarding house became a symbol for the downtrodden black folks in her town. Merkeson is nothing short of magnificent  in a performance that earned her a Golden Globe and an Emmy Award. Merkeson is backed by an impressive all-star cast that includes Terrance Howard (brilliant and heartbreaking as Nanny's husband)  Louis Gossett Jr.  Rosie Perez  Jimmy Smits  Delroy Lindo  Macy Gray  Michael K. Williams  Jeffrey Wright  Henry Simmons  Patricia Wettig  Ernie Hudson  Mos Def  and Hill Harper as the adult Ruben. Colorful and exciting  beautifully photographed and exquisitely scored  this is one of a kind motion picture experience that works on all levels  but if for no other reason  is worth seeing for the electrifying starring performance by S. Epatha Merkeson  who is given the role of a lifetime and makes the most of it.,positive
I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM  so I had the opportunity to see it. It's rather hard to find  despite it being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately  it also has its shortcomings  some of which Hitchcock has repeated later. First off  the ending is a little too neat and perfect. In the last few scenes  until the last five minutes  there is an astounding amount of tension; then  the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up... very unsatisfying. The ending is also overly dramatic  for a Hitchcock film. He is  was and always will be the master of suspense... why would he stoop to something as low as a cheap action sequence for the ending? Apart from the few shortcomings  the film is great. The plot is excellent; one of the best and most universal ever. The theme? Simple. You meet a stranger. A perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you... you know you have someone you want(if nothing else  subconsciously) dead. The catch? He asks you to do the same for him... will you accept this bizarre yet ingenious arrangement? You're clear of suspicion  and so is he... after all  neither of you knew the victim. And you don't know each other  either... you're just 'strangers on a train'. Brilliant concept  and one that just about every single person can relate to. The pacing is good  you never lose interest or patience. The cinematography is good  but not nearly as good as it is in other  better Hitchcock films. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written  credible and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the same elements that he often uses; the dominating mother  the mothers boy  etc. The film is very good  but it just feels a little watered down. It didn't go that famous extra mile that would have made it great. It stopped before crossing the line between what's common and what's daring. That is the primary reason for the film failing to be great  but mainly remains good  with potential to be more than that. The end leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed. However  everything leading up to the end is very good  so the film still gets a deserving 8/10. Good  but not great. Any fan of Hitchcock should see it  as it is among his best... somewhat far down on the list  but still there. I recommend it to any fan of Hitchcock. 8/10,positive
In my never-ending quest to see as many quality movies as possible in my lifetime  i stumbled upon this film on cable. I tried Hitchcock three times before this  and never have i felt that the man's work lived up to the praise he had received. I always felt he was good  not great (from what I've seen) This was the best of his films I've seen thusfar. Robert Walker is absolutely chilling  his performance takes the film where Hitchcock wanted it to go. Even an average performance here damages the overall product. My favorite scene was his obsession about getting the lighter from the drain (how exactly does he get his arm down there though?) Bruno is quite a compelling character  but i also loved the performance by Patricia Hitchcock as Barbara. The rest of the Morton family as well as Guy were a bit dry and boring  but she added some flare to the movie  as well as having some of the better lines in the script.<br /><br />Lastly  in any suspense movie  you're going to live and die by your ending. This one holds water  unlike a couple other Hitchcock films I've seen. I truly was unsure of how it would end  which kept me on the edge while i watched and waited.,positive
I knew the premise of this film  and obviously I can't miss a good sounding film  especially from Master of Suspense director Sir Alfred Hitchcock. Basically tennis champ Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets eccentric stranger  Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train travelling from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder  Guy hates his wife  and Bruno hates his father  so Bruno suggests swapping murders. Guy obviously didn't take him seriously  until of course when Guy's wife Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) is found murdered in an amusement park. Guy of course is the chief suspect  and Bruno keeps bumping into him reminding him of their plan  and giving him more things to help him kill the father he wants dead. This murder enquiry and Bruno's stalking are threatening his tennis career  and his relationship with the daughter of Sen. Morton (North by Northwest's Leo G. Carroll)  Anne (Ruth Roman). Bruno realises that Guy won't do his murder  so he decides to plant the evidence at the crime scene to make him guilty  Guy's monogrammed cigarette lighter at the amusement park. After his tennis game  Guy and Anne (who obviously found out the murder plan) race to the amusement park to stop Bruno  and they have a fight on the speeding out-of-control carousel. Also starring Patricia Hitchcock (the director's daughter) as Barbara Morton  Marion Lorne as Mrs. Anthony  Jonathan Hale as Mr. Anthony  Howard St. John as Police Capt. Turley and John Brown as Prof. Collins  and Hitchcock's cameo is the Man boarding train carrying a double bass. Some interesting dialogue and character interactions  some good suspense moments  and of course the unforgettable carousel finale  a good classic film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons  the film was number 32 on 100 Years  100 Thrills. Very good!,positive
As I looked at this movie once again  I think it belongs among Hitchcock's greatest films. The first time I saw it I was just blown away by the suspense  action and imagery. It has the gripping ending  the deranged murderer  the innocent man framed or victimized by circumstances  some great on-location shots  e.g. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has great supporting actors with Hitch's daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and the stalwart Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movies. The merry-go-round episode near the end is one of the most nerve-wracking in Hitchcock's body of work.<br /><br />Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his last full film) gives a great performance as the deranged stranger on the train  who worms himself into the life of the unsuspecting tennis star  Guy Haines (Farley Granger). Granger plays the nice guy who is caught up in a messy divorce. The movie opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men as they leave their taxis to board the train. Eventually  they meet and the story takes over. The stranger takes an unusual interest in the tennis star and as the movie continues the stranger becomes a stalker. The action shifts from place to place  including Washington  the fictional small town of Metcalf  the Forest Hills tennis championship  and a passenger train taking the two leading men back and forth on separate missions. Towards the end  the pace of a tennis game is woven into the plot as they race against time. The camera cuts away to the faces of the athletes as they volley and serve in a remarkable series of shots. When the closely-fought contest is over  the climactic chase takes place. Hitchcock has a love for trains and it is great to see Penn Station  long since gone. Trains are featured in the 39 Steps  the Lady Vanishes  Shadow of a Doubt  Spellbound  North by Northwest and this movie. <br /><br />This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the start of a period of great creativity for the master of suspense - the 1950's and I am convinced that one day it will be given its due in the Hitchcock hall of fame.,positive
"One of Alfred Hitchcock's three greatest films  along with Psycho and The 39 Steps  Strangers On A Train is as brilliantly out-of-control as a merry-go-round in Metcalf  and almost as deadly. It's the kind of film you have so much fun watching  you can't even feel properly guilty about it until you have time to catch your breath.<br /><br />Top amateur tennis contender Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a singularly weird  louche stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages  Bruno knows all about Guy's problems with his no-good wife Miriam  and rather gaily suggests they do each other a favor: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno's father  who wants to put Bruno in an institution. Guy laughs it off  but Bruno ain't kidding  as Guy finds out to his peril.<br /><br />It's a great premise for a murder story  and Hitchcock gives Strangers On A Train a run for all its worth  with the help of Walker in perhaps the greatest performance in any Hitchcock film  including Anthony Perkins in Psycho. While Perkins makes his mark playing tetchily against the grain  Walker as Anthony is one perfectly at home either buttering up old ladies at a swank dinner party or strangling a young woman at an amusement park.<br /><br />What drives Bruno? Many commentators suggest his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty Guy. Yes  Bruno lights up the old gay-dar  but Guy seems happy enough on love's rebound with socialite Anne Morton (Ruth Roman). Bruno's interest for Guy could just as easily be envy  for someone making a mark in the world while he lives at home  letting Mommy file his nails.<br /><br />Oh, I certainly admire people who do things, Bruno purrs  looking like a cat eyeing a mouse. You know, it must be pretty exciting to be so important.<br /><br />Later on  Bruno calls himself a bum  accurate enough except for our rooting interest in him  even as he wrecks Guy's life with his homicidal meddling. It's the ultimate perverse underdog's tale. There's a sense of integrity about Bruno  in his dogged dedication  which commands our respect and which Hitchcock plays to so brilliantly. When Bruno floats away from the scene of his big crime  am I the only sick person in this world who's actually happy for him? I think not  yet Hitchcock keeps the story on a right-enough path for us to realize how low we have fallen. We don't want Bruno to win  exactly  but we enjoy his élan as he tries.<br /><br />Everything else is so perfect  or at least close enough  to make every shot memorable. Hitchcock always managed at least 2-3 good setpiece sequences per movie; here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone. (20 Big Shows the neon side at the entrance says  and they aren't kidding.) Script  camera-work  a gripping tennis match  Ruth Roman's jaw-dropping figure  it's all too much greatness for one film to contain. Even Granger does his callow-youth thing here with more risible plausibility than Gregory Peck ever managed.<br /><br />You can call this a clinic in movie-making  but clinic sounds too dull. Strangers On A Train is good nasty fun  all the way through  leaving you with a nifty stinger at the tail as you realize you were rooting for the wrong stranger all along. Heck  I'll take that ride over again in a second!",positive
Safer indeed. Hitchcock is cinema's all time pervert; however  we all know his perversions are ours as well  so we forgive him. And we not only forgive him but we applaud his clever way to invite us for an unforgettable train ride.<br /><br />I saw Hitch's 1953  I Confess  a week before this one  and I put both in the same category as part of his trademarks. These trademarks resided in his genius questioning and pulsing his artistic veins that spills psychological drops of blood on the viewer without leaving stains of guilt  instead very subtle awareness of feeling ashame.<br /><br />The pen is always mightier than the sword and Hitch firmly wrote the most arguable questions with his wrist  and then holding firmly with his hands  he held cameras that always reflected peoples thirst for blood (most humans have)  otherwise comedy wouldn't be mostly a tragic thing  and making people laugh wouldn't be so complex.<br /><br />Mixing all dark elements of high society  with a wealthy psychopath Bruno  and an ambitious tennis player wanna be politician  Guy  the story is one of the most well constructed and guided by Hitch  inspiring many filmmakers  not only with its plot  but with tricky images provoking dark smiles and happy nightmares.<br /><br />Barely perfect!,positive
When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes  and his contractual arrangement with David O. Selznick ended because of this. Actually he made some really good films in the period  such as NOTORIOUS  SPELLBOUND  UNDER CAPRICORN  ROPE  and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked  the audiences were turned off by Hitch's attempts at experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable  as was the setting among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public (making ignore the merits of that film)  and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked - far more disliked then it deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of it's star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem to be a failure (which it wasn't). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in it's favor.<br /><br />With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN  Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films. Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith  the story was of how Guy Haines  a professional tennis player  meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony  a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and fawning  and Guy views him as one of the typical fans he has met...if a little eccentric  with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam  and is in love with Anne Morton  daughter of a Senator. Bruno knows that Miriam won't divorce her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather  who is constantly criticizing him. Then Bruno mentions (sort of off the cuff) an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect  unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees it is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy's destination  and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just does not realize that the eccentric Bruno is a sociopath  and believes Guy has just agreed to the two killing each other's foe!<br /><br />It's a wonderfully simple plot actually. Bruno  of course does kill Miriam  but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified - and worse  he finds that he is the police department's number one suspect. When Bruno  to encourage Guy  mentions he has the latter's lighter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site  Guy finds himself in deeper problems - how to avoid the police  and how to control (if possible) the insane Bruno?<br /><br />Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully  so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other. There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other's orbits. It is like fate drawing them together. Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch  with a typical twist  makes the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure. His scheme may be vicious (it will kill two people if successful  and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what) but he has a zest for life. One suspects that once Guy too had one  but his marriage's failure  coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman  has made him more circumspect and dull than he was.<br /><br />The cast is good too. Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this film (only a year before his death). It was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK. His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE  especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies  Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam - enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses) so that they actually are cheering Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman)  who bears a close resemblance to Miriam  and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman is properly supportive of Granger  but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background  and somewhat low keyed. Other supporting performers  Leo G. Caroll as the Senator  Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's dotty mother  and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are all shown to best advantage - all at the hand of a master.,positive
I have never seen this in the theater  my second viewing was tonight on big screen DVD as opposed to old VHS tape from rental store.<br /><br />Saucey for it's time and I'm sure the Hayes code was pushed to it's limits.<br /><br />Hitch's pallet here is the game play between two combatants. And yes if Guy calls the cops on Bruno right away the movie is 63 min shorter  HELLO people do you always make the best or most logical choice. How many times have you been in either person's shoes and made the right choice? For the love of God it's called poetic license..However as Guy sees the situation he has found himself in he takes it upon himself to rectify it. He does not solicit help nor does he lie to his would be new wife. Her defense of him sets off the final show down with Bruno feeling he has one more card to play.<br /><br />For the cop shot-ting an innocent person in pre-cam corder days and before rules of engagement this type of thing did happen. In the post Rodney King world a presidential candidate backed the police in sending 43 bullets at an unarmed man. If you haven't seen or witnessed outrageous police behavior your blind or have an application pending for the academeny.<br /><br />Back to the movie...<br /><br />Go watch it with. Try and wear a post WWII filter and pretend your seeing a great suspense movie like many did for the first time back then  and sure it's been copied since but your looking at one of the source of inspiration for many that followed.,positive
In Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's Strangers On A Train  Guy Haines (Farley Granger)and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker)meet for the first time on a train journey and discuss the idea of carrying out two murders. The rather pushy Anthony suggests that he could murder Haines' unfaithful wife and Haines could murder Anthony's domineering father. The lack of any connection between the murderer and the victim in each case should ensure that both crimes would remain unsolved. The tenor of the conversation leaves the more easy going Haines with the impression that the proposal is not entirely serious. Complications arise later when Anthony murders Haines' wife in an amusement park and then pursues Haines to keep his side of the bargain.<br /><br />The differences between the two men are clear from the start. Haines is a professional tennis player  respectable and rather modest about his achievements whereas Anthony's life is going nowhere and he admits to having been thrown out of three colleges for drinking and gambling. Haines is in a relationship with a Senator's daughter who he wants to marry. Anthony characteristically interprets this as a cynical manoeuvre on Haines' part to provide himself with a shortcut to a career. The character differences are also reinforced visually. Anthony often inhabits shadowed areas and travels in a boat called Pluto whereas Haines is frequently seen from the more heroic perspective provided by low camera angles.<br /><br />There are some striking visual sequences such as:- <br /><br />(1) The murder of Haines' wife which is shown through the reflection of her glasses which fall to the ground as she struggles to free herself from Anthony.<br /><br />(2) The depiction of Anthony alone  dressed in black and looking very small against the enormous white Jefferson Memorial building.<br /><br />(3) The occasion where all the spectators at a tennis match are moving their heads in unison  following the action  whilst one head (Anthony's) chillingly remains fixed in a position looking at Haines.<br /><br />(4)The scene where the roundabout goes wildly out of control and eventually crashes spectacularly.<br /><br />Frequent use is made of doubles throughout the story  for example  Haines and Anthony are originally introduced as 2 pairs of feet getting out of their taxis and going to the train. As the train pulls out of the station  there are 2 sets of tracks each providing a choice of 2 ways forward. The 2 men discuss the murders of 2 potential victims and order 2 double whiskies. The Hitchcock cameo sees him struggling on board the train carrying a double bass. Haines feels double crossed when his wife reneges on an agreement they had for her to see a lawyer to arrange a divorce. Haines' wife goes to the amusement park with 2 boyfriends. When Anthony confronts her before the murder he lights his cigarette lighter and produces 2 reflections in her glasses. Anthony later becomes very disconcerted when he meets the Senator's younger daughter who he sees as a double for Haines' wife. Anthony also feels double crossed when Haines refuses to go ahead with the second murder. When Haines is travelling alone in a train going to Metcalf  he sees 2 men in the same carriage accidentally kicking their feet together in the same way that he and Anthony had.<br /><br />The action throughout the movie proceeds at a great pace and the performances of Robert Walker and Patricia Hitchcock (as the Senator's younger daughter) are particularly powerful.,positive
"In Truffaut book-length interview with Hitchcock  it's apparent that Big Al's fear from the police dates back to his childhood. His father sent him to the police station carrying a note. The note said: He's been naughty, imprison him for an hour. The policemen obliged and ever since Hitchcock has had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and taken by the police.<br /><br />Strangers on a Train is probably one of the best in his wrongly-accused series. The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. That's the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She was always fascinated by smart criminals.<br /><br />Hitchcock's opening is very strong and takes you immediately to the protagonists: Guy Haines  a famous tennis player  and Bruno Anthony  the aspiring criminal. The two guys share a chemistry which in that day and age was probably a lot more than what the audience could chew. Bruno tries to persuade Guy that they could commit the perfect murder (leaving no clues)  if they switch victims. Bruno will kill Guy's wife who wouldn't give him a divorce  and Guy would kill Bruno's father. The motives are respectively love and money.<br /><br />Bruno's performance is meant to be seductive and homoerotic. This is not something that was done by accident. In fact  Hitchcock edited two versions of the movie: one US  one UK. In the US version the volume of Bruno's seductiveness was turned down quite a bit.<br /><br />Strangers on a Train is a very deep movie but more importantly this is another excellent Hitchcock thriller. An excellent example of a thrilling scene is when Guy is climbing the steps up to Bruno's father room. Hitchcock reasoned that the audience's attention needed to be distracted at this point so that they don't figure out what Guy will find in the room. Hitch treats us to a HUGE  menacing dog at the top of the stairs which provided the needed distraction.<br /><br />The most famous shot in the movie occurs during a tennis match. Bruno has been continuously stalking Guy so that Guy will fulfil his end of the bargain (kill his father). When Guy looks at the audience  all the heads are swiveling back and forth. All except one - Bruno's. He's looking straight at Guy with an i'll-get-you smile.<br /><br />The ending is another example of suspense. Both men fight for one key piece of evidence on a merry-go-round that's rotating at mad speed. A worker is crawling under it so he could get to the controls. When we finally get off this ride and the movie ends with Guy proving his innocence  we are left exhausted and nail-less (for those of us still biting our nails!).<br /><br />Strangers on a Train is easily one of Hitchcock's best wrongly accused movies. Some credit him with one of the best villains (Bruno) as well. All in all  the movie might appear somewhat dated but that's a lesson in thriller-making from the master himself. I won't turn down Leonardo  if he came to teach me Renaissance painting  so neither should you.<br /><br /><< Review posted at FilmDailies.com>>",positive
This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films  and one of his most underrated. I believe it certainly exceeds a 'Psycho' or 'The Birds' for technical artistry and brilliance. It is a macabre  tense  darkly humorous product that will leave you in awe for quite some time.<br /><br />Robert Walker creates one of Hitchcock's most memorable villains as the father-hating  mother-fixated (but aren't most of Hitchcock's villains mummy's boys?) Bruno. It is a disturbing  stunning performance that illuminates the whole film. His character is obsessive  apparently homosexual (look at those deliberately effeminate ties and hear how he is described as 'European')  strangely charming and dangerous to cross. Farley Granger certainly knows this as he becomes entangled in Bruno's sordid web after the pair meet on a train. Bruno  knowing some inside information on Guy's affairs  proposes the two 'swap' murders for each other's benefit. Walker will kill Granger's slutty  conniving wife who is inhibiting his marriage to beautiful Anne  whilst Granger will murder Bruno's father  who he so intensely hates. Everyone's happy  right? A win-win  as Bruno asserts? Wrong. Granger forgets about the indecent proposal  but an obsessed Walker doesn't. He commits his murder and is determined to hound Granger until he completes his side of the bargain too. 'Strangers' becomes a riveting  suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse in Hitch's capable hands.<br /><br />Hitchcock was absolutely amazing at creating intriguing minor characters and building scenes. We have the whore Miriam  Granger's estranged wife pregnant to another man. She lasciviously slurps a phallic ice-cream cone whilst openly eating up Bruno with her eyes. Barbara Morton  Anne's sister  is a deceptively sweet yet smart and cunning young girl who comes out with the most crude remarks you'll hear from a bespectacled girl in the pictures in the 50's. Senator Morton is authoritative and self-absorbed. This is one of the most daring films Hitchcock ever made  and it is  typical to a Hitch film  subtly sexual in detail.<br /><br />This fits into the film-noir category with it's focus on murder  lies and deceit and shadowy cinematography. Walker's nut is one for the ages  and Granger makes a convincing troubled protagonist. Roman is perhaps weaker than the other two  and I never believed her relationship with Granger. Still  the overwhelming positives cancel out the slight negatives and it can be safely said that this is one of the BEST American films ever made.<br /><br />Just look at what Hitch does here- the originality  the technical skill. We see the murder of Miriam reflected in her shattered glasses. A game of tennis turns into one of the most thrilling  intense scenes you'll ever see. A innocent fairground turns into a place of murder and foul occurrences. A young boy's balloon is popped callously by Walker (Hitch obviously liked what he saw in 'The Third Man!').Children's delight at riding the carousel turns into screaming  fast-paced terror. Hitch subverts normal  everyday events like no other.<br /><br />The camera-work here is among the best ever seen in a Hitchcock film  and the premise is to-die-for. It's slick  oozes sophistication and devilish charm. The cross-cutting between Walker and Granger's characters is magnificent- Granger's do-or-die tennis match is just as vital as villain Walker's rescue of an incriminating piece of evidence lost down a drain. Hitch again build his villain into a nasty  repulsive yet sympathetic and oddly charming (Did anyone else find him strangely attractive  more so than Granger?) piece of work- we are just as tense as Walker in our hope that he can get the lighter out of the drain. We need him to  anyway. He holds the key to the story.<br /><br />You'll never view an approach from a stranger in the same way again after seeing this film.<br /><br />Amazing.<br /><br />10/10.,positive
This is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times. I'll go so far as to put it up there with Ray and The Aviator. It is the story of a young  bi-racial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing Miss Rachael aka Nanny. You will fall in love with Nanny  a woman who gives all of herself to those around her. S. Epatha Merkerson brings the character to life beautifully  and the other cast members are do the same. If I were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles  I'd have to mention everyone in the entire cast. <br /><br />The music in this film perfectly blends with the story  almost dictates the way it goes. And what's more  this film is actually entertaining. It won't bore you at all  not even for a minute! <br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone wanting to spend an evening at home watching a very smart  very entertaining  quality film.,positive
How many movies are there that you can think of when you see a movie like this? I can't count them but it sure seemed like the movie makers were trying to give me a hint. I was reminded so often of other movies  it became a big distraction. One of the borrowed memorable lines came from a movie from 2003 - Day After Tomorrow. One line by itself  is not so bad but this movie borrows so much from so many movies it becomes a bad risk.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />See The Movie! Despite its downfalls there is enough to make it interesting and maybe make it appear clever. While borrowing so much from other movies it never goes overboard. In fact  you'll probably find yourself battening down the hatches and riding the storm out. Why? ...Costner and Kutcher played their characters very well. I have never been a fan of Kutcher's and I nearly gave up on him in The Guardian  but he surfaced in good fashion. Costner carries the movie swimmingly with the best of Costner's ability. I don't think Mrs. Robinson had anything to do with his success.<br /><br />The supporting cast all around played their parts well. I had no problem with any of them in the end. But some of these characters were used too much.<br /><br />From here on out I can only nit-pick so I will save you the wear and tear. Enjoy the movie  the parts that work  work well enough to keep your head above water. Just don't expect a smooth ride.<br /><br />7 of 10 but almost a 6.,positive
Well  this is about as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was only a master of commercial suspense or maybe a compulsive technician -- or was he really deep. Nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean  but it's legitimate to ask if  at his best  he could not have been all three things at once.<br /><br />In this one he seems to be about at his peak. Hardly anything in it is accidental. It abounds with doubt  ambiguity  and wit. And the story is engrossing  Patricia Highsmith apparently having complexes similar to Hitchcock's own.<br /><br />I'm sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so I won't bother going into it. I'll just point out five on screen incidents that Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible for.<br /><br />Bruno Antony (Walker) has followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night with the intent of murdering her. She's noticed his attention and is innocently flattered by it.<br /><br />1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through The Tunnel of Love and then to an island in the center of the lake. Walker is right behind them  smiling  in his boat -- Pluto. Pluto. It's not an allusion to the Walt Disney cartoon character. It's a reference to Pluto  also called Hades  a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This tiny touch can't be an accident. And the underworld that Walker represents is not just a literal hell  but the underworld of the human mind. I hate to say he's a Jungian shadow but that's what he is. (Did Carl Jung see this movie? He was alive at the time of its release -- but probably not.) 2. Now  this is a deadly serious sequence  right? Walker is a lunatic who is about to murder a woman he doesn't even know. Imagine the way this would have been laid out by most directors. A night-time stalking through a crowded carnival  stealing from shadow to shadow  the killer peering from behind the canvas walls  and so forth. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker first comes through the gates  concentrating on his victim  a little boy in a cowboy suit  holding a balloon  runs up and shouts  Bang! Bang! You're dead! Walker jerks his head back in surprise and glares down indignantly at the kid. And when the kid starts to walk away  Walker darts his cigarette at the balloon and pops it  then continues his pursuit without another glance. That's one way Hitchcock treats impending doom.<br /><br />3. The famous strangling reflected in the fallen eyeglasses  which has been aped innumerable times.<br /><br />4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of those devices that you pound with a big mallet  sending a kind of hockey puck up the shaft to measure the strength of your blow. One of her boyfriend whams it and the puck doesn't reach the bell at the top. Under Miriam's delighted and admiring gaze  Walker smiles and rubs his hands together  then picks up the mallet  slams it down  and the puck bangs against the bell. She's thrilled. He puts the mallet down  looks at her  grins  and WAGGLES HIS EYEBROWS at her like a ten-year-old showoff! 5. After the discovery of Miriam's body  while whistles blow and people shout  Walker leaves the carnival and encounters a blind man waiting at the curb. Walker takes the old fellow by the arm and leads him across the intersection  gravely holding up his hand to stop the traffic. A macabre joke.<br /><br />These incidents and others all take place during the ten or fifteen-minutes of the carnival visit. (Robert Walker's performance is exceptional throughout.) It's essentially a kind of invitation to be noirish. (Cf: Ride the Pink Horse) But the menace of the scene is undercut by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. None of the familiar noir techniques are employed. There's nothing really creepy about it. And the murder itself is hardly a savage one. I don't think that any director other than Hitchcock would have handled it the way he did. It would have been all menace and shadows  hiding places  abortive attempts  scowls instead of grins.<br /><br />Not that it's an entirely flawless movie. A flawless movie is not yet with us. Some of the middle section is a bit slow going and Farley Granger  although a nice guy  is stolid  dull  and rather stupid. His new girl friend is just dull.<br /><br />Hitchcock was to treat the misattribution of guilt with deadly seriousness in The Wrong Man. I'm not sure Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal guilt and moral guilt. The latter was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education. Original sin -- you're BORN with it -- and all that. In filmed interviews  he always glibly explained away his fear of the police and of authorities generally by telling a story about his father taking him to the police station to put a scare into him after some peccadillo. We're justified in asking if that was only what psychoanalysis calls a screen memory. I hope you get the pun. I know  I know. It's strained and inept but I spent a good deal of valuable time thinking it up.,positive
Looking back at the career of Alfred Hitchcock  it never fails to be surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be denied sufficient recognition for how revolutionary he was for the film industry. It is likely a sign of how ahead of his time Hitchcock was  always attempting to push the envelope  and never coasting along with a film made simply for the purpose of being entertaining  but always with a deeper  more poignant motive on his mind. Strangers on a Train  one of Hitchcock's first and more underrated hits  is a perfect example of these traits - an entertaining and suspenseful story  even when viewed over 50 years later  yes  but so carefully and intelligently constructed it stands today as a masterpiece in film technique. <br /><br />Arguably one of the pioneering suspense thrillers  Strangers on a Train may come across as slightly dated in certain aspects  but it retains every bit of superbly crafted tension as it did back in 1951 (if perhaps slightly less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting as well as quick  careful editing are what really make the film stand out  drawing out every possible iota of tension and retaining the audience's focus even in slower scenes. If there was ever any doubt of what a simply masterful filmmaker Hitchcock was  simply watching five minutes of Strangers on a Train should be enough to disavow such sentiments; every shot is so carefully chosen and constructed  all serving to drive the storyline ahead in a particularly innovative fashion. Sadly enough  there are certain moments in the story which are screechingly out of place enough to jar our focus away from the superb cinematography and editing - Bruno being able to reach down to the bottom of a sewer grate is simply unbelievable  and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wildly out of control carousel provides unintentional comedic relief in what is meant to be the film's most tense and engaging scene. These are only brief moments  but they are enough to stand out as painfully weak in an otherwise stellar film.<br /><br />But what really makes Strangers on a Train stand out is the story premise. As Hollywood films of late run the risk of descending inescapably further and further into the vat of turgid clichée after clichée  it's wonderfully refreshing to see a 50 year old film with a premise which actually comes across as smart and original. Sure it's fairly straightforward  but the concept of swapping murders is simply one that would not fly in films of today's day and age  which makes it all the more entertaining to watch; the film's brilliant screenplay keeps the action flowing at a swift pace while providing us with some wonderfully memorable lines all the while. One can't help but notice the deeper themes Hitchcock is alluding to throughout as well  especially the concept of darkness in humanity's heart  demonstrated by elderly ladies being fascinated and exhilarated by the prospect of murder  as well as Bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humour (Bruno popping a child's balloon with his cigarette is priceless)  and irony  shooting suspenseful scenes in happy  easy-going environments  such as the iconic carnival scenes  to create an even more eerie atmosphere. This may be a suspense thriller  yes  but to overlook the brain concealed beneath it would be simply inexcusable. <br /><br />The antagonistic figure of Bruno (essayed to perverse perfection by Robert Walker  sadly in his last film role  but easily stealing the film from his admittably very talented fellow cast members) is without a doubt what makes Strangers on a Train so memorable  as the character is a marvel to behold. Here we have a simply superbly crafted villainous figure  all the more intriguing by how ordinary and unassuming he seems. Rather than cackling madly and thwarting the hero at every possible moment  Bruno is a calm  controlled  psychotic mess. He speaks of murder in such an offhand tone  yet retains a passionate glint in his eye when discussing different fashions of killing people. Bruno could seem to represent the Id  as Freud would put it  the inner  darker and uninhibited aspects of mankind. It makes an interesting contrast to the hero figure  Guy Haines  and how bland and uninteresting he seems  almost as if to drive home the prospect of evil being much more interesting and appealing than constantly striving to do the right thing. <br /><br />Yet despite this implied message  Hitch still twists our emotions enough that we root for Guy at every turn  and cheer at each new obstacle he is forced to overcome. It's a testament to actor Farley Granger's talent that despite Robert Walker's villain easily stealing the show  Granger's hero still comes across as sympathetic  still commanding our support even when falling prey to being a far less compelling character. Superb support is given by Ruth Roman  who manages to overcome the clichée and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest figure  Kasey Rogers giving a stunning performance as Guy's horrifyingly manipulative and hedonistic first wife  and Patricia Hitchcock  proving that she is far more talented than being simply the director's daughter would imply. The superb cast (headed by a simply wonderful Walker) really bring the film to life  adding so much more merit to the film than simply Hitchcock's breathtaking stylistics. <br /><br />All in all  Strangers on a Train may still come across as slightly too dated for certain viewers  but it's still a shock how modern and appealing to contemporary audiences seems  considering it was released half a century ago. Once again  Hitchcock proves his unparalleled mastery of tension and film technique  and the film's surprisingly original and enjoyable premise is alone worth a viewing. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliantly made but superbly entertaining film experience! <br /><br />-9/10,positive
I have used this movie in my college Ethics courses for over 10 years (also Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors--another terrific  multi-leveled ethical study). <br /><br />It's fiction. I don't focus too much on the unrealistic features of Strangers because all fictional films are obviously false on many levels. I love the film as gallows comedy  tautly told  with many ironic twists and visual pleasures--even if it's unbelievable. The story is told so well that I don't even think of criticizing its plausibility (although I must confess that the tennis match seems the weakest part to me--too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition).<br /><br />Some problems presented in the film that hold promise for realistic moral education and ethical discussion:<br /><br />1. Ethical Passivity: some weaknesses of the Guy character are intended by Hitchcock. A primary ethical insight of the film is the danger of inability to articulate one's moral positions. Guy is unable to effectively block Bruno's crazy proposals at the start. An interesting question is why and how does Guy behave so passively  ineffectively? A possible answer is his depression because of his intense and complicated divorce process. <br /><br />2. Miscommunication: Guy commits another failure at the start: on the train  to get away quickly  he agrees that Bruno's ideas are all good. But Guy's literal meaning is opposite to his inflected  sarcastic meaning. Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the criss-cross murders. Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement. To some extent  near the beginning  Bruno may be partially pretending that an agreement has been struck  to draw Guy further into a web of complicity. Bruno is manipulating Guy; Guy's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno a chance to put an ethical stranglehold on Guy. Bruno manipulating Guy may also take on other meanings . . . .<br /><br />3. Secrecy: Some have speculated about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. It seems at first ridiculous  especially since Guy appears obviously heterosexual in his relationships with Miriam and Anne. However  remember that Guy is also ineffective with both women. Guy appears (stereotypically--it's 1951 remember) effeminate  especially in relationship to Bruno. Guy  the strong athlete  is weak on the inside. Bruno is also conflicted (playing against himself)  appearing facially and physically strong at first but then displaying some effeminate traits (Bruno's fashion and footwork; his gushing emotionally to Guy in different situations; his receiving a manicure from his doting mother; Bruno kissing and desperately fondling his mother's hand; other more subtle gay stereotypes that hold cryptic meaning from Hitchcock's point of view). I wish I could hear Hitchcock clarify his intended meanings here.<br /><br />4. Dishonesty and Distrust: Guy makes some colossal blunders in hiding truths about Bruno from family and from police. Guy fails to fully comprehend that admitting fault quickly may be better than a cover-up or a delay in confession. Again Guy is driven by passivity  insecurity  fear--and perhaps a self-hate that is closer to Bruno's own self-loathing than we care to see or to admit. Both Guy and Bruno act out their own parables of impotence.<br /><br />5. Lack of Evidence: Guy feels a problem mustering the evidence to acquit himself. While quickly going to the police would solve a huge problem  Guy traps himself with his own doubts and insecurities: the absence of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on Guy's behalf; the obsessive need to appear politically pristine; and other personality factors that cause Guy to feel defenseless. He is as dysfunctional as Bruno--just not as dangerous (yet one could partially blame Guy for Miriam's murder).<br /><br />6. Disease and Mental Disorder: an interesting question is how legally responsible is Bruno for the murders? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is as a sick sociopath  the more guilty Guy may be as someone healthy who failed to stand up and morally act to prevent the crimes. Guy's failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide  and death ensues. One could argue that more than one crime is committed and that Guy is an emotionally hobbled accomplice.<br /><br />These and many other features of the film make Strangers on a Train a gem of a morality play  a diamond for philosophical and cinematic reflections.,positive
This is such a revered and studied film  a classic among Hitchcock's many  it takes no cajoling to want to watch it again. Yet you think: can it hold up even when the huge (and clever  and amazing) trick of the plot is no surprise?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />And for starters there is the start  a profoundly beautiful and slick telling of the really the whole story  the gist of it. Two taxis  two men shown with their shoes  each walking onto the train  sitting then across from each other  and  oops  a mistake  a little nudge  and the conversation begins  and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. <br /><br />The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock  as it is in many horror and suspense films-- cheery and light. We know entering the film  however  that this won't be the case  so already we are worried. What  after all  is about to go wrong?<br /><br />A lot. In truly Hitchcock fashion  it is a purely innocent man (nearly always a man) who faces injustice  who is trapped by circumstance threatening what is most valuable to him. The innocent in this case  tennis player Guy Haynes  is played with an innocence that is believable--his collegiate politeness in that first scene  for example  as he realizes the other man is a little cuckoo  is just what you or I might do. The not-so-innocent man is the self- absorbed and scarily intelligent spoiled child  Bruno Anthony  played with utter brilliance by Robert Walker. (This uncanny performance is equivalent to that of another Hitchcock wacko  played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) So from scene one  on the train (and the train  really gorgeous!)  we have the two leads and we have the mind-blowing and utterly simple and ultimately devastating plot  from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith  who also wrote the books behind the two Mr. Ripley movies. And it doesn't hurt that the screenplay was co- written by Raymond Chandler himself  who knows something about economy and clever dialog. And crime.<br /><br />And of course there is more than just the first scene. What to note? Well  that smarty of a senator's daughter (I thought she was terrific) is Hitchcock's daughter  Patricia  who is still with us (as of 2009; she also had a role in Psycho). And there is a characteristic landmark location for a key scene in the film--the tennis courts in the Hamptons  known to us as the site of the U.S. Open. The fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves into a kind of slow and steady montage  building up the suspense by making it surreal. The fear gets positively fattening with the laughing children and the old man crawling underneath it all. And when it collapses in a crash--that's all backprojected on a set  one of the more naturalistic uses by a director known for not worrying about the realism of his back projections.<br /><br />The photography is that perfect Hollywood stunning without becoming so stylized (as in some noir films) that it is an object in its own right. Look again at the first scene  or the shooting (and editing) of Haynes entering the house for what the audience thinks is a murder. This is sophisticated construction. When we are not completely surprised that it's Bruno in the bed  that only proves that the director has us on our toes. Something unexpected is always expected.<br /><br />Are there glitches? Who knows? It depends on what kind of falseness you can accept (or embrace) as beautiful style. The scene where Bruno is choking the old woman at a party is both brilliant (the woman  played by Norma Varden  is a caricature so believable it takes your breath away) and marred by his looking at the senator's daughter and being triggered into a deadly trance by her glasses  and her resemblance to his earlier victim. This is a mid-20th Century idea of psychology that intrudes on many of Hitchcock's efforts. (The end of Psycho  for starters.)<br /><br />The Wikipedia article on the film smartly emphasizes the consistent doubling of things in the movie  from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator's daughter. This echoes in lots of little ways--two men trail him to the tennis court  two men accompany the victim to the amusement park  and so on. There can be too much made of this  but it does supply an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness. Don't forget  there are meant to be two murders--it is the lack of the second murder  the inability to create a doubling in that case  that causes Bruno to unravel.<br /><br />Walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this movie was shot  and just afterwards  he died from a reaction to a drug used to calm one of his outbursts. Though he appeared in other films  Strangers on a Train is easily his tour-de- force. Farley Granger had a long career that never quite saw him break into true stardom  though his style can have a peculiar nervous sweetness that really works  especially in They Live by Night. <br /><br />And if you watch this one for the first or third time  do look for the chilling and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowd's heads all move back and forth in unison-- except for Bruno's. He is staring out without moving his head straight at us. As the trailer for the movie says  after this movie  you won't be talking to strangers on a train.,positive
"<br /><br />Lets swap Murders- your wife, my father- seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey. Guy  a solid  respectable tennis player  whose problem is that his wife  the flirtatious Miriam  won't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter Anne  laughs the whole conversation off as a joke. The following week he isn't laughing any more. In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense  Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her. As he does  her glasses fall off and we see the murder eerily reflected twice through her lenses. Cold hearted and amoral Bruno  his part of the deal completed  approaches an appalled Guy expecting  even pressuring him into 'doing his bit.' Matters are not helped when Anne's precocious and outspoken younger sister turns up suspecting Guy of Miriam's murder. So accused of a murder he didn't commit and expected to commit another  what is Guy going to do? The power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature - and this Hitchcock does to perfection.",positive
In Strangers On A Train  it's obvious from the start that playboy wastrel Robert Walker has singled out Farley Granger as an unwilling accomplice to a pair of murders. Granger's a semi-public figure  he's a tennis pro  but not an especially high one. High enough however for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and would like to be free to marry Ruth Roman.<br /><br />So when they meet as complete Strangers On A Train one afternoon  Walker knows enough that Granger will at least be intrigued enough with the possibility that if the two of them  complete strangers  did commit homicide on parties that the other would be convenienced by their demise. Though Granger is repulsed by the idea  one of the beautiful things about this film  is that you can see in the performance he gives that Granger just might submit to temptation.<br /><br />In fact when Walker kills Laura Elliot  Granger's wife whose been two timing him and even gotten pregnant by another man  he expects that Granger will in turn murder Walker's father so that Walker can inherit his estate. Today Walker would be called a trust fund baby and a pretty malevolent one at that.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock directed Walker to his career role  ironically in his last complete film. Walker died the following year with most of My Son John finished. Hitchcock does not do too bad by Farley Granger either. <br /><br />Of course when Granger does balk at committing homicide on people who never did anything to him  the tension. Strangers On A Train is also characterized by great editing  first in the tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and waylay Walker before he plants evidence convicting Granger at the crime scene. And also in that final climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger.<br /><br />Strangers On A Train is Hitchcock at his best  it should not be missed and ought to be required viewing when film classes study editing.,positive
Strangers on a Train was one of those film classics I had always heard about but somehow never gotten around to actually seeing. I finally watched it a few weeks ago and  as always with any Hitchcock movie  it not only stood up to the test of time  it far surpassed most thrillers being made today. You can see the inspiration for future action movies here - the climactic ending with the out-of-control merry-go-round and the two villains dueling each other reminded me of the big action sequence at the end of Jan de Bont's Speed. Of course  Strangers is over forty years older than Speed and contains no modern special effects  but the visceral thrill is there - Hitchcock was a true genius.<br /><br />The not-so-subtle gay side of Bruno (Robert Walker in an amazing performance) has taken form in many other psycho-stalker-figures in future movies. Consider him a male version of Jennifer Jason Leigh in Single White Female. He knows about Guy before he even meets him on the train - we almost get the feeling their contact isn't incidental - and is soon entirely obsessed with him.<br /><br />Hitchcock loved the Oedipial elements in his movies (also see Psycho for more blatant undertones) and there's a lot of that here. Bruno hates his father and wants him to die so he can be with his mother. His effeminate ways and obvious homosexuality must have just slipped by the censors in 1951  when gays were not allowed to be portrayed on the screen - yet Hitchcock gets the message through effectively when we see Bruno in the lounge on the telephone wearing a very non-masculine robe  flirting with Guy and responding to his mother.<br /><br />The deep layers of this movie make it a fast-paced thriller than you can return to again and again - unfortunately it's being remade as a big-budget Hollywood production  but after seeing the original I honestly can't imagine anything surpassing the sheer white-knuckle thrills of this movie.,positive
Even though some unrealistic things happen at the end (i.e. a cop shooting a gun into a crowded merry-go-round where any number of innocent could be killed)  this still was an intense  enjoyable thriller  one of Alfred Hitchcock's better films. Robert Walker is excellent as the chilling nutcase  really convincing giving a fascinating performance that is almost too creepy at times. His co-star in here  Farley Granger  is okay but is no match for Walker  either in acting or in the characters they play. It's the typical Hitchcock film with some strange camera angles  immoral themes  innocent man gets in trouble  etc. Unlike a lot of his other films  I thought this one was a fast-moving story with a very few dull spots. Being an ex-tennis player  I enjoyed his footage of some excellent old net matches that featured some good rallies. Hitchcock's real-life daughter Patricia has an interesting and unique minor character role in here. She didn't just get the job because of her dad; she can act. Also of note: the DVD has both the British and American versions and there were some differences in the story. This is a classic film that is still referred to in modern-day films  even comedies such as Throw Momma Off The Train.,positive
Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers  and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time. One film that tends to get somewhat lost under the Vertigo's and the Psycho's is this film; Strangers on a Train  the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever made. The story follows Guy Haines  a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the Senator's daughter  if he can get a divorce from his current wife. One day  on the way to see his wife  he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall; and one that could ultimately cost him his life.<br /><br />The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinema's most intriguing and thought provoking of all time. What if two people swapped murders  thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime  and rendering their motive irrelevant? Could this truly be the perfect murder? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is lead into could happen to any  normal everyday person. Everyone has someone they'd like to get rid of  so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his? The chances of it happening are unlikely  but it's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of Strangers on a Train; and in this situation  anyone could. <br /><br />Is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony any better than Robert Walker? The man was simply born for the part. He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in. The character of Bruno is a madman  but he's not a lunatic; he's a calculating  conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable. His performance is extremely malevolent  and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality. Unfortunately  Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train  and I believe that is a great loss to cinema. Nobody in the cast shines as much as Walker does  but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger. Granger never really impresses that much  but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against Walker. Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person; and that is how it should be. Ruth Roman is Guy's wife to be. She isn't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression  but she makes the best of what she has. Alfred Hitchcock's daughter  Patricia  takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara  the sister of Guy's fiancé. She is suitably lovely in this role  and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock's direction is always sublime  and it is very much so in this film. There is one shot in particular  that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses. This is an absolutely brilliant shot  and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene. Hitchcock's direction is moody throughout  and very much complies with the film noir style. The climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting  and I don't think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film. It's truly overblown  and out of turn from the rest of the movie; but it works. There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time  and the reason for that is that he doesn't only use the script to tell the film's story  but he also uses to camera to do so as well. Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made. Its story is both intriguing and thought provoking  and is sure to delight any fan of cinema. A masterpiece.,positive
S. Epatha Merkerson shines as Nanny in this touching and vibrant look at the life of Ruben Santiago  Jr. (Marcus Franklin) while growing up under the guardianship of Nanny. The film gives a good character study of both Nanny and Ruben and manages to capture life's ups and downs in a realistic fashion unlike so many memoirs that are made into film. The supporting cast adds much spark and many recognizable faces appear in smaller roles including Mos Def  Macy Gray  Terrence Dashon Howard  Rosie Perez  Louis Gossett  Jr.  Liev Schreiber  Jimmy Smits  Ernie Hudson  Delroy Lindo  and Patricia Wettig. Loses some steam and vibrancy towards the end  and the ending sequence leaves a bittersweet feeling. But  overall a great film with a truly outstanding performance by Merkerson.,positive
One would have expected Hitchcock's return to major studio filmmaking to err on the side of chastened caution. Surely few expected his most riotous  unrestrained film  a gleeful melange of vicious black comedy  exciting suspense  mocking manipulation  and astonishing flights of fancy. But that is precisely what they got: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN.<br /><br />What is remarkable is how much Bruno's transgression disrupts the world of the film. Much has been made of the masterly crosscutting motif  but its immediate effect is to completely obstruct the straight line of progress Guy is making of his life  and hence the society he represents or is eager to join. Guy is the archetypal American  the working-class boy made good  moving in influential circles  athletic  successful  handsome. Bruno is his destructive opposite  gay  decadent  'European' (he lives off his father  in a Big House  and just lounges about dreaming of murder). Bruno's life is one of repetition  circularity  whereas Guy moves straight ahead. It is Bruno's achievement to move Guy into his realm (represented by the merry-go-round) and force HIM to transgress (break the law  hope for murder (Bruno's)).<br /><br />Bruno is quite literally fighting patriarchy. All the authority figures in the film are criticised - Bruno's father  a man whose brutality we get a glimpse of  but the true horror of which is constantly alluded to in the film (especially in Aunt Clara's paintings - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Anna's incredibly Machiavellian  self-serving father; the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunching after an execution; the tennis commentator whose smugly authorative comments are always mistaken. Far from being the mother-hater of legend  Hitch  as Robin Wood perceived  is deeply hostile to fathers and patriarchy.<br /><br />Bruno's transgression turns the world topsy-turvy. This is Hitch's most surreal film. Whenever Guy is in his plot  he is filmed straight  with conventionally romantic music. But whenever Bruno intrudes  the atmosphere becomes carnivalesque  bizarre  much more fun. This is Hitch's first truly American film  revelling in the primitive detritus of Americana. Grown men puncture little boys' balloons  or try to throw them off merry-go-rounds. Distinguished professors of mathematics sing about goats on trains. Elderly society matrons are strangled at elegant soirees. Washington is filmed like a series of spare lines in a vast desert under a huge sky  like a haunting Dali painting. There is one of the greatest  and funniest  scenes in all cinema when we see a motionless  smiling Bruno in a sea of turning heads at a tennis match  an image worthy of Magritte. Just look at any scene with Bruno in it  and watch it derail into the bizarre.<br /><br />Phalluses abound in the most ridiculous permutations - check all those balloons (Hitch had obviously just seen THE THIRD MAN) - as well as in more staid environs: Washington will never look the same again. STRANGERS is also  VERTIGO notwithstanding  Hitch's most overtly sexual film - as well as the phalluses  there is the sustained homoeroticism  the remarkable play with 'riding' horses; the gobsmacking fellatio joke when Hitch's daughter spills powder over the policeman.<br /><br />And yet Hitch doesn't stint on good old suspense. In the very proper endeavour to show what a great artist he was  critics tend to overlook what made him famous in the first place. Much has been made of Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates  and Hitch plays merry havoc on audience identification  willing Bruno into murder. There is a hilariously painful sequence where Bruno loses the lighter with which he intends to frame Guy down a drain. The gasps of tension and sighs of relief on the part of the audience I was a part of in support of an insane murderer is inherently funny  slightly disturbing  and highly revealing about our true reactions to conformity and success. And Hitch milks it with callous glee - listen to the mocking music and exagerrated compositions  and kick yourself for taking it all so seriously.<br /><br />STRANGERS is one of Hitch's five best films  and therefore one of the greatest things in cinema. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant  I can't believe it wasn't written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful imp  standing in for her cheeky father as she taunts Guy. The fairground finale is a remarkable  dizzying fusion of exciting  tense set-piece  black comedy and symbolic site. If Bruno's final words condemn him to hell (according to the Catholic precepts Hitch is supposed to embody: compare with a similar ending in THE KILLERS)  we applaud his integrity  infinitely preferable to Guy's debased serving of self.,positive
Cam Archer's lyrical Bobbycrush boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt) that is more vibe than narrative. Caught somewhere between documentary and dream  Bobbycrush recalls the inventiveness of early Todd Haynes and the vivid hyperrealism of Gus van Sant. With grit  glamour and heartbreak  it's kinda like the movie equivalent of Sonic Youth playing bubblegum pop.,positive
Beautiful....that one word pretty much sums up this whole film. Everything from the cinematography  the directing  the acting.....brilliant. At any point of the film  you can pause it  and you will no doubt be looking at something mosaic or artsy fartsy as some people would say. I assure you  that after one viewing  Bobbycrush will be stuck in your head. I know this from first hand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes together very well with the tone and pace of the film. Be thankful that Cam Archer exists in this world. We need more people like him to make films that show love and shame in totally real (and surreal) imagery.,positive
Dylan and Bobby are boyhood friends and they are in love the way that young boys sometimes are. But Dylan has met a girl and is starting to put those boyhood things aside. Bobby knows that he's not interested in girls and misses what he had with Dylan. <br /><br />Told as part cheesy 80's pop video  part home movie  part video recollection this film tells a confusing and sad  but all too often true  story that will hit home with many that see it. <br /><br />This film brings back a lot of memories and struck a very true chord with me but I wish the film maker had gone a bit further and left it on a happier note. Yes  we all love and lose  even when we are young  but there's always tomorrow  especially when we are young.,positive
Very enjoyable 50's Western. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western fans.<br /><br />Mostly Victor Mature's movie and quite well done in my estimation.<br /><br />He's a trapper who joins a frontier post as a scout. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. They all joined as scouts after their loss.<br /><br />Victor has set his eye's on the Colonel's wife and lives life on the post without much regards to regulations.<br /><br />Action done quite convincingly but no great depth or much feeling to other characters.<br /><br />50's Westerns are my favorites and this slides easily to a satisfaction. A Western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps never to be made much again. One to enjoy. Gave it a 7 rating. Likely 6.8 worthy but films like these become more precious over time.<br /><br />For film-noir fans...The Big Steal They Live By Night Side Street are most wonderful movies to be enjoyed. Bought and viewed. Noir seems to resemble Westerns in a way. Some long ago and never forever.,positive
I enjoyed this film  which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex love-hate relations  along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline. All the main characters are well cast. True  John Wayne or Robert Mitchum could probably have done the starring role just as well  but Victor Mature certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling Tarzan of sorts. Reminds me of his film role as Samson  another difficult  but not impossible  man to tame.<br /><br />The mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism  as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20 years before  with the collapse of western beaver populations as well as the fashion market for beaver pelts. This story supposedly takes place in Oregon just before the end of the Civil War. Judging by the volcano in the background of the opening scene(probably Mt. Lassen)  the fictional fort was located somewhere in a remote section of the Cascades  as we never see any other civilians. However  there is plenty of conflicting evidence that it actually takes place in the mountains of Wyoming or Montana! Red Cloud  the war chief who threatens the trappers and soldiers in the fort  is the namesake of a very famous Sioux war chief who led a very successful campaign in 1865-66 to exterminate the newly built army forts in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie(eastern Wyoming)is mentioned as being not too far removed from the fictional fort. The plains tribe of Assiniboines is mentioning as joining Red Cloud. This aspect of the story  then  bears a general resemblance to historical fact.<br /><br />It may be of interest to note certain resemblances between the plot of this story and that of John Ford's Fort Apache. In both cases  we have a fort commander who was recently assigned to his first frontier post with Native American problems. He underestimates the military prowess of his adversaries  regarding them as little more than cannon fodder to promote his career. In both films  he pays dearly for his inexperience in dealing with the enemy.. Also in common  the greenhorn commander resents a subordinate who has long experience with the local Native Americans and wants to tell him what is wise to do and not to do. In both films  we have a budding romantic relaionship between a woman very close to the commander's heart and a subordinate  which the commander does everything to squelch. Clearly  the commander must be eliminated to allow these romances to proceed to completion.<br /><br />I also see certain resemblances with The Misfits. The soldiers  as a whole  including the commander  are misfits of a sort((as one of them admits): mostly they have problems or are raw recruits with no experience fighting Native Americans. The commander's wife apparently is the only woman in or anywhere near this fort  thus is inherently a misfit  with a husband who is very uncertain of his future in the army. The trappers  in turn  are also misfits  not really wanting to accept army or civilian discipline  yet cut off from their previous free spirit lives by the recent army-generated antagonism by Red Cloud. <br /><br />Finally  we can also compare this story with Anthony Mann's later film The Far Country  starring Jimmy Stewart. In Stewart's case  he can choose to return to being a loner cowboy  at the end. But Mature's character doesn't come up with an appetizing new way of being his own boss. Red Cloud has made life outside of the army in this region too dangerous to contemplate. Besides  he has an obsession with the Commander's wife.,positive
Victor Mature  as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper  may be on the poster  but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to get cut to ribbons by Confederate artillery at Shiloh  and is sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence  has the most interesting part  married to a young and hard to recognize at first Anne Bancroft. The uncivilized Mature lusts for the colonel's wife  giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man's wife at one point by James Whitmore who plays Mature's older and wiser mountain man father figure. Directed by Anthony Mann  this film is lost among his more famous westerns with James Stewart  but even so you really don't need the Indian menace to make this a film worth seeing  although Preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the Indians under submission  in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout.,positive
this is another good western which i enjoyed.it's not an epic or anything but it is good for what it is.it' about 3 fur trappers led by a men named Jed who is crude and uncivilized.Jed and his two friends find themselves as scouts for a fort that is the only thing standing between them and and Indian band who resent the Americans on their land and want to take it back.that's the gist of the story.what follows is action excitement even a bit of humour and forbidden romance.one of Jed's friends Gus reminded me a lot of the character Quint(played by Robert Shaw)in the movie Jaws.they both have that crusty gruff demeanor.anyway if you're a western fan you should find lots to like about this particular entry.i think it deserves a 7/10,positive
"One of the more obscure of Anthony Mann's Westerns  The Last Frontier was also his only cavalry Western (aside from one brief episode in Winchester '73)  though naturally he focuses on the outsiders and internal conflicts rather than offering a Fordian celebration of comradeship and shared ideals. Set not in his beloved high country but in the foothills and forests  it's a much more cynical view of life of the frontier  in many ways his Fort Apache without the need to preserve the legend: this outpost is made up of misfits  failures  cowards and the odd competent officer ignored by his superiors  badly led while the Civil War takes priority and all the best the army has to offer.<br /><br />Victor Mature and James Whitmore are the free trappers who find civilisation creeping up on them when they are relieved of their pelts and packhorses by a local tribe aggrieved by the incursion of the Cavalry into their territory. Rather than blame the Indians for their losses they decide it's the army's fault for building the fort and decide to demand compensation from them  ending up joining their ranks as scouts instead. But despite the best efforts of Guy Madison's amiable and competent acting commander to bring Mature into the 19th Century and make him fit to wear the uniform  the arrival of Robert Preston's humiliated Colonel eager to revenge himself on the tribe that drove him out of his own outpost  and Mature's clumsy infatuation with the Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft  too much of a blank slate here to do much with the role of a woman who's tired of being saved by men who think they know what's best for her)  soon drive matters into much darker territory. It's not long before some of the soldiers are busily planning on killing each other  both sides trying to goad their subordinates into doing the deed for them: little wonder that at one point Mature throws away the bluecoat he has long coveted in disgust  screaming I would have died for this, but it's nothing but a dirty filthy blue rag! The Stallone of his day  Mature was one of those actors who could surprise you with the odd excellent performance here and there when matched with the right part and the right director. This is not one of his better days despite having his most complex part  perversely enough as a simple man  well-meaning but drunk  violent  uneducated and with a unsubtle  almost childlike lust for life  the part seems designed with Burt Lancaster in mind  with some striking similarities to his character in The Kentuckian. But Robert Preston's Ahab-like Colonel is clearly the best role  determined to resurrect the career he destroyed in a single disastrously suicidal Civil War engagement by launching another pointless suicidal campaign against the tribe that added another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight and out of mind of the promotion board. In his obsession to redeem his career he moves further away from any hope of moral redemption  driven as much by his sense of shame at his wife's sympathy as by the promotion of former comrades he regards as his inferiors. He's beyond salvation  but there's still a recognisable human being in there and one not entirely without a sense of integrity  he genuinely admires Madison's courage in making a futile attempt to get Preston's orders countermanded by their superiors  fatally skewed though it is.<br /><br />Like its hero  the film is a little rough around the edges (and boasts one of the most surreal and jaunty title songs of any Western)  but that only tends to make it more interesting  and there are plenty of Mann's typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective  while the frontier setting is convincingly harsh and primitive. Unfortunately the deficiencies of the early CinemaScope lenses are very apparent in Columbia's DVD  with the image often dark (2.55:1 CinemaScope required a huge amount of additional lighting and early Scope films show a lot of trial-and-error) and grainy.",positive
<br /><br />`The Last Frontier' is a superior western that overcomes numerous deficiencies in weaving its tale of trappers Jed (Victor Mature)  Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with the army  particularly Captain Riordon (Guy Madison)  Colonel Marston(Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston  colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Hired as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians  Jed  Gus and Mungo adjust to living the `civilized' life within a fort on the edge of the `last frontier.' Jed  who has been raised by Gus  both inspires and looks up to the `older' Gus and Mungo  and has an especially difficult time dealing with `civilization.' His real problems start after he becomes strongly attracted to the colonel's wife  Corrina. Colonel Marstonis a reckless man  who endangers every one around him with his dreams of ruthless victory over any opponent. Corrina  a woman repressed by her station and sense of responsibility  loves her husband for what he could be and Jed for what he is. Caught in the middle is Captain Riordon  a brave and likeable man torn among his duty to the army  his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the likely disastrous consequences of the colonel's recklessness. <br /><br />What makes this movie so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that  in most cases the weaknesses and the strengths of `The Last Frontier' are EXACTLY the same elements (forget the insipid title and dated music)<br /><br />First  the screenplay. Almost all of the subplots (particularly  the reckless Colonel) have been done better elsewhere  but have rarely been assembled with such eccentricity. Just when you THINK you know what is going to happen next  this one takes off in a DIFFERENT direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: `The Last Frontier' being a `Production Code' movie (back in the day the word `virgin' was taboo)  it's very surprising that the adultery factor was handled in such a mature  tolerant manner. I expected either Jed or the colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin. I was surprised and a little disappointed the movie didn't exploit that expectation to create a less predictable ending.<br /><br />Second  the casting. Mature is at least ten years too old to play the part of Jed  the wild-eyed innocent raised in the woods'. James Whitmore  who plays Gus  `the man who raised Jed' is actually five years younger than Mature. Nevertheless  Mature is very endearing  playing a character who is innocent of civilization but is in no way stupid. Although there were several actors who could have played the role at the time (most notably  Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas)  none could have played Jed better. Preston (also Mature's junior) plays Colonel Marston  missing the tics and affectations one would expect from such a driven man. However  Preston perfectly captures the sense of honor someone must have seen in Marston to promote such a reckless fool to colonel's rank. Bancroft is an especially shrewd choice as Corrina. Bancroft's dark hair has been died blonde  and this achieves the same effect as it did for Winona Ryder (`Edward Scissorhands') and Christina Ricci (`Sleepy Hollow'). That is  I felt conflicted about the character without knowing exactly why; I believe the answer is that blondes and brunettes have considerably different skin tones and eye shades. Further  Bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness (here the blonde hair softens her up a bit  though). This enables the 24 year old Bancroft to stand toe to toe with both the 40 year old Mature and the 37 year old Preston; yep  she could be a colonel's wife. Madison walks a careful balancing act as Riordan  handling a complex role and sometimes ackward dialogue.Playing a role similar to that of John Wayne in `Fort Apache' Madison does a more skillful job at it.<br /><br />This movie has a `Silverado' type camaraderie. That alone makes it worth seeing. It also has memorable performances  beautiful scenerary and great action and direction. I just hope a letterbox version is available (many have been lost)  because this movie takes full advantage of that format.,positive
Ordinarily  Anthony Mann made westerns with 'the big guys' - James Stewart  Gary Cooper  Henry Fonda . . . the A list cowboy stars. But in this B+ film  he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. The main character  played by Victor Mature  is a trapper/ mountain man  and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson  that sort of thing  where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men. Not here. For once  a true mountain man - vulgar  crude  animalistic - is the central figure  and it's something to see  giving Mature one of his better later roles. The real acting chops are provided by Robert Preston  excellent as a self-absorbed Custer type cavalry commander  and James Whitmore  the poor man's Spencer Tracy  as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile Indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other. Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the officer's wife  who is initially repulsed by the very sight of Mature's grisly character  then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize  to her own shock  that she's attracted to him. Rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen  without the romantic allure that John Ford gave such a place in his masterful Fort Apache. The battle sequences are big scale and notably violent  and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format. Good show  and underrated movie  all around.,positive
Ever since I first encountered the Divine Ms Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's She's Gotta Have It I have been sold on the range of this exceedingly gifted yet terribly underrated actress. She received an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatement.<br /><br />Here she simply shines as THE guiding force and hand in her community. This was especially poignant for me for I grew up in this very same time period. The production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed. She was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot  hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again. I first saw Macy Gray's name in the credits and went ho-hum. Her performance was so good  I didn't even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through. I am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in African-American culture that is very tastefully done.<br /><br />Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but infinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices.<br /><br />This is a worthy  elegant presentation of African-American life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic. You owe it to yourself to have this as part of your collection.<br /><br />I highly recommend.,positive
A very delightful bit of filmwork that should have had wider distribution. Ian McShane is right at home playing the soul loving DJ who gets canned because he won't  go along with the program  and sets out to let the world know what they're missing. The supporting cast is great as well  and the music is the Soul of the film. I just wish that the film would be released so that I could get a copy of this for my film library.,positive
The sort of little film which studios used to excel at but seldom make anymore. Sort of a soul version of the more well-known The Last Of The Blonde Bombshells. Ian McShane is excellent as a DJ and aficionado of soul music who becomes obsessed with the idea of re-uniting the members of a classic soul group  and the film follows his exploits as well as those of the group members; a cast which includes such genuine musical talent as Isaac Hayes  as well as acting stalwarts Taurean Blacque  Derrick O'Connor and Antonio Fargas. Not meant to be an epic by any means  this is nonetheless a chunk of solid gold.,positive
Better than average World War II-era who-dun-it featuring Warner Baxter as a former gangster who suffered amnesia and has been reborn as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway who helps both the police and criminals who want to go straight. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also involves a victim who might have some mental problems. The link to courage is not particularly clear.<br /><br />This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson whose two previous wives have under mysterious circumstances and who in turn dies in a locked room under conditions that resemble suicide but Dr. Ordway labels murder. Hillary Brooke plays the part of widow Kathleen Carson who is involved with Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act includes his sister that disappears on stage. As a mystery novelist  Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor as is Lloyd Corrigan as an aficionado in crime.<br /><br />Spooky houses with creaking doors  caskets in the cellar  and suspects that are never seen in daylight add to the air of suspense. The set for the dance sequence is quite elaborate and the ballet music very good. Direction  production design  and photography stand out. The exterior shots and costumes suggest more affluence rather than normally found in the average B detective thriller.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.,positive
Another nice entry in the Crime Doctor series [#4/10]  with atmospheric almost noirish black and white photography and some splendid Spanish American backdrops and sets. And a more off-the-wall storyline too!<br /><br />A man who looks like the insane murderer of his first two wives is found dead in a locked room after a dramatic dinner party. The Crime Doctor is on the scene (ostensibly as a guest) to immediately and resignedly proclaim it murder  and so we are presented with a quite weird set of people to mull over  for one of them did the deed. Was it the frothing brother of the dead 1st wife  the 3rd wife and rich widow Hilary Brooke  the dancing brother and sister vampires  the intense young man  the eccentric cabinet maker Lloyd Corrigan on loan from Boston Blackie  the irreplaceable butler  or odds-on Jerome Cowan? Police Inspector Emory Parnell had his work cut out  but Warner Baxter as Ordway was as unflappable as ever in working it all out. One of the goofs listed on the IMDb is wrong: On breaking into the murder room Ordway says Right through the centre of the forehead and Cowan replies He didn't miss this time. Favorite bits: Baxter and Cowan travelling through club sandwiches and beer at the nightclub to make amends for their interrupted dinner party; The scene where the Braga's place of repose is seemingly rumbled. The plot does seem to meander a bit at times and the way it was all explained off was perhaps more worthy of Monogram  but leaving it in the air as supernatural wouldn't do either!<br /><br />Well worth a watch if you already like the genre  you won't be disappointed unless you really don't like the genre.,positive
I saw this on TCM recently and  through the IMDb I found that there were seven Crime Doctor movies with Warner Baxter as the psychiatrist-detective. Baxter is a bit long in the tooth compared to his stolid performance in 42nd Street a decade earlier. Not noir  and a bit campy today  the movie also has a touch of the possible supernatural. The plot  black and white cinematography and characters are far more complex than those of the Mr. Moto and Charlie Chan series. There are subplots  unexpected twists and appearances by a number of B movie stalwartly we all should recognize immediately (none ever made it to the A status). It is a wonderfully unpredictable 70 minutes.<br /><br />I would love to see a boxed DVD series of these films.,positive
Note: After writing this review I see that this listing is indeed about the TV series and not the original film. My mistake. I thought IMDb for a database for movies  not TV shows. But since most people will look up this film under BAGDAD CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM  which  strangely  is the name this film is listed under on IMDb  I'll leave this comment here.<br /><br />Maybe I missed something  but when I read that other review it seemed to be entirely a review of the CBS series -- which must have been loosely based on this film. I did not see the TV series and I might like it or not  but one thing I am sure is that it is very different than this film. This film is NOT like a TV show at all and Whoopie Goldberg is not in it or any other famous Hollywood stars (other than Jack Palance  who was very charming in his role).<br /><br />This is a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks outside the box. It is not at all like a Hollywood formula movie  which is probably why the (what's a nice word for idiots?) who decide to market movies or not decided not to market this one.<br /><br />First of all  this movie captured my heart and imagination from the get-go. From the music (which is just part of the time so you can't really call it a musical) to the cinematography to the really cool story.<br /><br />A German or Bavarian woman (very pretty and quite plump) gets in an argument with the other German or Bavarian man with whom she is traveling through the California desert with and parts ways with him --he taking off in the car and she left to fend for herself on a deserted and desert-like highway out in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />She finds the small and dilapidated but charming Bagdad Cafe  in Bagdad  California and checks in. The rest of the story is magic. I don't want to try to describe this film because I want you to enjoy every surprise.<br /><br />Warning: If you are a racist or have something against big women you will not like this movie  as the main romantic lead is a big woman and characters of brown and red skin have large roles and are included as part of the mix without any racism involved.<br /><br />I gave this film a 10 for orginality  entertainment and sheer delightfulness.,positive
"You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s.<br /><br />On top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags  the plot is as far-fetched as the tales The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it. But then  that's how unrealistic the comedy is.<br /><br />But--if you're a true Red Skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the '40s--you can at least enjoy the amiable cast supporting him. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Grey do nicely as his love interest and Conrad Veidt  as always  makes an interesting villain. One of his more amusing moments is his reaction to Skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans. I never knew that, he muses  impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced.<br /><br />All in all  typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are. Not always easy for a discriminating viewer as many of them simply fall flat  the way many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the sight gags and one-liners has simply worn off.",positive
"Red Skelton plays a radio detective known as The Fox in Whistling in the Dark, also starring Ann Rutherford  Conrad Veidt  Eve Arden  Virgina Grey and Rags Ragland. Wally Benton  aka The Fox finds his plans to marry his fiancé Carol (Rutherford) thwarted when he's kidnapped by a the leader of a sham cult (Veidt). Joseph Jones (Veidt) has just learned that his cult  The Silver Haven  is not getting a promised inheritance because of the existence of the old woman's nephew  who is going to be living off of the interest. He wants Wally to devise a perfect murder plot so the man can be killed on the airplane en route to meet with his attorney. For backup  and because he's not sure which one is Wally's fiancé  Jones kidnaps Carol and also the radio sponsor's daughter (Grey).<br /><br />This  to me anyway  is a superior film to the second entry in this series  Whistling in Dixie. The plot is better  the cast is better  there is less slapstick and fewer corny jokes. Skelton  when he's not making faces and rolling his eyes  is quite amiable  and Rutherford is very good. Veidt always played these evil men to perfection. Eve Arden is Wally's agent  who arranges a date for him and Grey to make sure his contract is renewed. I had only seen Grey in films from the 1950s onward. She was always a good-looking woman  but who knew she was such a knockout in the '30s and '40s? This is a fun film with a neat cast.",positive
There are 3 of these movies  all similarly crafted and each extremely amusing. Red plays radio sleuth Wally Benton  aka The Fox who gets wrangled into solving real life crimes along with his fiance played by your typical wartime girl next door looker  Ann Rutherford. Many of the one-liners and gags are dumb and probably were in the 1940s which I anticipated. But  just as many actually made me laugh out loud  which was unexpected to say the least. Red Skelton has a surprisingly strong screen presence  surprising I say because I grew up with a much older version of the man who's charm really didnt play well in my formidable years. I have to give these movies the go ahead though -if your in the mood for this type of nostalgic fare. I almost threw in light hearted  but in truth people get wasted and beaten up and dare i say it  the suspense at times is well above average. As with most movies from this era  it gets a PI (politically incorrect) rating for reasons you can well imagine. Wartime is funny that way I guess  and so then again are these movies. Watch one  watch them all.,positive
Lackawana Blues An impressive HBO movie about a beautiful woman that made her house a home for several characters.Touching alive entrancing-a great mix of sound and story- based on a true story featuring an All-Star cast.A time capsule about .....<br /><br />you get the point and no I am not on the payola for the HBO crew- I would throw around more superlatives but I am about to go out . The extras on the DVD include a deleted scene a featurette and commentary.The funniest part about the featurette was star lighting they used when interviewing exec producer Halle Berry..<br /><br />OK seriously - good times A,positive
Red Skelton (in his first starring role) plays Wally Benton who plays 'The Fox' on a radio show. He writes the murder mysteries and as 'The Fox' solves them. Joseph Jones (Conrad Veidt) is trying to figure out how to perform the perfect murder on someone. He kidnaps Benton  his girlfriend (Ann Rutherford) and another girlfriend (Virginia Grey). He tells Benton to write out the perfect murder...or his girlfriends get it...<br /><br />Very funny and enjoyable movie. Fast-moving (it's only 77 minutes)  a good script and perfect casting really puts this across. Skelton is very good in his first starring role--very funny  fast  handsome and intelligent. Veidt is excellent as the evil Jones. Rutherford and Grey are lots of fun as Skelton's girlfriends. All three of them play off each other perfectly--their verbal sparring is the highlight of this pic. Also fun to see Eve Arden in a small role.<br /><br />Well worth your time.,positive
While many pass this off as a B movie it is  indeed  a first class comedy that is well-written and acted. Red Skelton is great as Wally Benton better known to radio fans as The Fox. Ann Rutherford is perfect as Wally's fiance Carol Lambert. Conrad Veidt leads a very well cast gang of criminals. I read one account of this movie which states that Vincente Minelli directed this film  not unless he changed his name to S. Sylvan Simon  who directed all three of the Fox movies. This is a very entertaining film made when imagination was encouraged. So get over your black and white prejudice if you have one  sit back and enjoy a truly great comedy. This was also Red's first starring role. Take note during the climax of the reference to Orson Welles' War Of the Worlds broadcast.,positive
This movie was sadly under-promoted but proved to be truly exceptional. Entering the theatre I knew nothing about the film except that a friend wanted to see it.<br /><br />I was caught off guard with the high quality of the film. I couldn't image Ashton Kutcher in a serious role  but his performance truly exemplified his character. This movie is exceptional and deserves our monetary support  unlike so many other movies. It does not come lightly for me to recommend any movie  but in this case I highly recommend that everyone see it.<br /><br />This films is Truly Exceptional!,positive
Is there any question that Jeffrey Combs is one of the true horror greats? This movie seriously doesn't suck and is sort of funny... Watching a young Combs at work is great but I wish he had had more lines. Look out for Beyond Re-Animator. It's going to kick some azz.,positive
Look  this movie is obscure  brilliant  and a classic that should sought out by any means necessary. I suppose the powers that be have decided that it will forever be relegated towards the bargin bin; nevertheless  we could only pray for the chance to see this one on DVD. I would say that it even beats the great Phatasm. If you like a dark movie  with plenty of spooky imagery  look for this one and see how an 80s horror movie is suppose to be.,positive
Legendary hammy and arrogant horror movie star Conrad Radzoff (splendidly played with wicked sardonic aplomb by Ferdy Mayne) dies of a heart attack. A bunch of drama school students steal Radzoff's corpse from its crypt and take it to a rundown mansion so they can party with it. Radzoff comes back to life and picks off the rude youths for desecrating his grave. Writer/director Norman Thaddeus Vane concocts a fresh  original  and even pretty stylish spin on the usual body count premise  offers a neat evocation of the glitzy Hollywood milieu  and does a sturdy job of maintaining a pleasingly misty and spooky ooga-booga atmosphere. The kill set pieces deliver the grisly goods  with a gal being set on fire  a juicy decapitation (the severed head rolls right down the stairs and onto the lawn so a raven can peck away at it!)  and another poor lass being crushed with a levitating coffin rating as the definite gruesome highlights. Kudos are also in order for the stellar cast of familiar B-flick faces: Mayne has a deliciously eye-rolling ball with his flashy role  Leon Askin contributes an amusing cameo as bitter washed-up director Wolfgang  Nita Talbot adds some class as flaky psychic medium Mrs. Rohmer  plus there are nice turns by Luca Bercovici as jerky drama student ringleader Saint  Jennifer Starrett as the sweet Meg  Jeffrey Combs as the geeky Stu  and Scott Thomson as the nerdy Bobo. Popping up in cool bits are Chuck Porky Mitchell as a detective  Patrick Wright in one of his customary policeman parts  and Tallie Cochrane as a corpse. Joel King's polished cinematography gives the film an attractive glossy look. The moody score by Jerry Mosely likewise hits the shuddery spot. A fun little fright flick.,positive
Ugh  what an embarrassing episode last night! It was either a failed script for ABC Afterschool Special  or the product of an earnest rookie writer  just out of college  making an homage to that classic PC anti-gun homily from 1974  The Gun. In fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasn't of The Gun being melted down like in the movie!<br /><br />No  I'm not some NRA shill. It's just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in his head that I should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal Cause  I'd appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn't delivered via 2-by-4. Geez!<br /><br />OK  the sociology lesson is over. The Message has been delivered. The Important Episode has been aired. Now let's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence.,positive
I have never missed an episode. David Morse is a wonderful actor and I am hoping that this show can survive. It certainly beats out that CSI crap. I love the storyline and would actually like to see him as a cop again someday. I give the show a 10.,positive
Ahh...I didn't order no amazing hit show.....We'll you got one Hack is simply the greatest television show ever made. A little bit of me died when I flicked on the t.v. one Friday night to catch a little Hack and it wasn't on. The show dug deep into key social issues of our culture. I found that at the end of any episode I watched; I walked away having been both entertained and informed. I am actually dumber now that Hack is gone. I no longer want to help the needy and less fortunate. Since Hack has been gone I see them as eyesore's and an unneeded strain on taxpayers. So for the love of God we need to bring back Hack!,positive
He's not your conventional cab driver.<br /><br />This guys got issues. With his wife  with his son  a priest  all his fares  his ex-partner and most of all himself. And the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it. So we have to keep watching to find out more about his past.<br /><br />The idea may not be original but David Morse makes it so. I think this is a great show  and I hope people catch-on before the season's over. <br /><br />WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!,positive
This is NOT your run-of-the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases. The episodes  so far  are more realistic and intelligent.<br /><br />If you are looking for something with a lot of butt-kicking Rambo-style cop story  you will not find it here.<br /><br />I gave it a 9. I wish this series lives long. Morse is excellent!,positive
Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched....well maybe a do-good cab driver in Philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met)  but that's what makes the show great.<br /><br />The fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun. Its highly watchable and even though u know Mike wins out in the end he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role. His supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great!<br /><br />All in all I watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action  I watch this show because its got great acting  a good premise  and a great story-line every week. It's also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by  or know what intersection he's at. I Love this show and I love Philly!! Give this show a shot!,positive
What a wonderful film  filled with eccentric  unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast. The director also did a great job keeping the story held together  getting those wonderful performances (on not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect. S. Epatha in the lead role is great. I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is  and although I have enjoyed her on Law and Order  this really shows what she can do with a filled out  complex role. Macy Gray is terrific  Mos Def  as usual  wonderful. Lou Gossett  great. Jimmy Smits  terrific  and doesn't try to pull focus because he's a star. A true piece of ensemble acting. <br /><br />Rent it  enjoy it  groove to it  and treasure it. Something special.,positive
It is nice to see a show that has a little more content than just blood and guts for a change! As an added bonus  it is nice to see some local home boys from Massachusetts making good in L.A. I hope this show will be a keeper.,positive
This is one of those movies that you just don't want to end. The characters are rich like a well woven tapestry. Colorful costumes  music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a boarding house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is taken in by a dynamic  big-hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences.<br /><br />I couldn't believe this was a made for television film. It was so well executed. S. Epatha Merkerson is wonderful as Nanny and she brings so much life to this role. You want to be right there amongst her boarders.<br /><br />I enjoyed this film so much I bought the DVD.,positive
An extremely dark and brooding show with an excellent cast. One of the few shows that I try to watch on a regular basis. Glad to see Bebe Neuwirth in a recurring role  but feel Andre Braugher is underutilized. He is one intense actor! Hope CBS gives it a better time slot next season.,positive
Okay  so this series kind of takes the route of 'here we go again!' Week in  week out David Morse's character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what's wrong with that!? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there  and certainly the coolest  and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven!!<br /><br />Due to the lack of love for this show by many  I can't see it going to a season series - but you never know? The amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - let's hope something good can make it past a first series!!!,positive
I like Hack. Think the Lone Ranger reincarnated as a 2000s cab driver  a decent but flawed guy  in Philadelphia doing his best  while seeking to work out issues from a troubled past  and you've got the synopsis. David Morse is nearly perfect as Olshansky. He helps people but instead of riding Silver in the old west he drives a cab through the mean streets of contemporary Philly  without handing out silver bullets. The supporting cast is first class and well above average. At times  the witty dialog almost reaches the level of that 70s classic series  The Rockford Files. This show deserves a return  hopefully in a better time slot than 9PM Friday(eastern).,positive
I love this show. It's clever and very well acted. David Morse and Andre Braugher have great chemistry. The writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief. After every new episode  I'm always amazed how thought provoking and at the same time entertaining this show is. My only complaint would be Donna Murphy's absence  at this point  in the second season. As David Morse ex-wife  Heather  she added such character to the show.<br /><br />I think this show is a credit to the crime/drama genre. With that said - I can not for the life of me understand why this show has such a low rating. Would someone please who gave this show a 1 rating back it up with a critique?,positive
I am sick of series with young and clueless people  talking about their problems all the time  self centered  boring and absolutely annoying (Popular; Dawson's Creek; Beverly Hills; etc). Hack is a breath of fresh air  with a great actor (David Morse)  a completely different plot  credible people with REAL problems (thank God !!) and very  very good histories. I just love it!! I hope Hack will go on for a long time  because it is a great television series for grown up people  for a change.,positive
David Morse and Andre Braugher are very talented actors  which is why I'm trying so hard to support this program. Unfortunately  an irrational plot  and very poor writing is making it difficult for me. I'm hoping that the show gets a serious overhaul  or that the actors find new projects that are worthy of them.,positive
I have only see three episodes of Hack  starring David Morse  and it looks as though I've missed 37 episodes! well thats if ITV 3 are showing them in chronological order. I've just watched 'Misty Blue' (episode 38). I have really enjoyed the 3 episodes  but then I'm a David Morse fan  (esp St. Elsewhere). For any one reading this  Hack is excellent. Pity its being aired on ITV 3. The cast is strong  though I cant get used to the idea of David playing a bent cop  still we all know he's the good guy wrongly accused. I see Gary Cole has guest starred  what ever happened to 'Midnight Caller'? Just wonder if Hack is available on DVD (yet). Lovin it. Cheers.,positive
"Hey, I didn't order no cab! Yeah, well you got one... What can I say about Hack...what a man among men. He was a heartened ex-cop turned cab driver with a heart of gold. If you were able to (and fortunately for America's TV viewers...one person per week was) penetrate the cold  hard surface of Hack's exterior  you got to see a caring man devoted to vigilante justice. The show was superb  I laughed  I cried  I smiled...all in the same episode. My arms would break out in goosebumps when our dear friend Hack would exit his cab in another dark alley...with nothing more than his fists...ready to avenge a wronged civilian. A smile would break out on my face when the screen showed me a criminal in a dark alley's facial expressions when the Taxi of Justice's headlights illuminated upon his face. Week after week I canceled my duties as president of the Klingon Association to bask in the warmth glow of Hack's brilliance. I have never seen a better show  and I mourned the loss of one of America's greatest treasures when the show was canceled. In other Hack-related news  I would like to announce to the world that my wife and I are expecting Hack Koen to come into the world in about three weeks.",positive
It seems that Hack has been described as un-realistic... but that's what TV is. TV is meant to provide an escape from everyday life and I feel Hack does a great job in that regard. Add to this the slow process of revealing his past and engaging/interesting plots; you just can't seem to get enough. Plus  with such great actors as David Morse  Andre Braugher  and even little Mathew Borish  what more can you ask for. So if you are looking for an involving experience and have a liking for underdog characters  I suggest giving Hack a chance  especially now that it's finally getting off its feet.,positive
To keep it as simple as possible. This is a very good show. That is well written  and has a fantastic cast. It's not loaded with blood and guts. And centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his ex-wife  his son  his former partner (Andre Braugher)  his childhood friend  now a priest (George Dzunzda)  and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode. Are you likely to find something like this going on in your city NO. Is this still a good story YES. And it's nice to see a man portrayed as good father in spite of his flaws. Watch more then one ( 2-3) and you'll see why a lot of us are hooked on this show. And thank you David Morse for making this character so interesting. Another good job!,positive
One of the best Lackawanna Blues<br /><br />Great movie great cast great music this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over you wish it would go on for another 90 minutes I will w3atch this one many times. <br /><br />This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature. The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role. You get the sense that you're really there taking all this in. A great deal of care was given in the sets  costumes and music of the period. The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on  but the steady performance of Ms. Merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before we've had our fill of the wonderful misfits. To single out anyone other than Nanny is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including:<br /><br />Jeffery Wright  Jimmy Smits  Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But it is Marcus Franklin  Macy Gray and Ms. Merkerson that makes this a wonderful experience.<br /><br />The movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards  but it is without question one of the best movies you're going to see this year. If you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally  tug at your heart  lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time  then this is the movie for you. I've shown it to several friends and they all want my copy  that says it all  the movie is that good. Check it out for yourself.<br /><br />danceability-1  Amsterdam Holland,positive
I made a promise that if ever I posted a comment that was less than complimentary  then later felt different about it  I would return and make known my change of heart. So far  this is the first time it's happened. <br /><br />I'm really starting to enjoy Hack. Something has clearly changed. The storylines seem to be much stronger. The plot may still be a tad surreal  but the characters have developed so much more depth that a surreal plot can be forgiven. I attribute this to fine acting. <br /><br />Not every show can come charging out of the starting gate a winner. Some need time to pick up speed. I'm glad I kept watching this program  and I really hope it lasts.,positive
"I am not a fan of musicals  but I am a huge fan of Jean Renoir and Jean Gabin. I rented this movie on a whim and was pleasantly surprised even expecting greatness from the classic director. This movie is BEAUTIFUL. The shots are like oil paintings with motion  something a lot of directors strive for but Renoir MASTERS. I cannot express how much this movie transcends itself... it's not really a musical  it just has a couple of well-placed musical numbers and a grand dancing finale. But there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute JOY when watching it.<br /><br />I am a fan of foreign art films  but I'm also a meathead who loves things like Die Hard and Schwarzenegger movies. I get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in la la land, but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is just irresistible -- not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good. 10 out of 10.",positive
"As a longtime admirer of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge and a more recent admirer of Jean Renoir's film-making  I knew that I'd inevitably watch his French Cancan sooner or later. The movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub. The impresario Danglard (Jean Gabin) tries to turn Montmartre laundress Nini (Françoise Arnoul) into a cancan star  without arousing the wrath of his tempestuous mistress  the belly-dancing Lola (Maria Felix). This is just one of several love triangles in French Cancan--true to stereotype  these French showbiz folk are always falling in love.<br /><br />Renoir directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters  and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie. Gabin perfectly incarnates the aging French playboy hero. Arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers  except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously used.<br /><br />French Cancan is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage  etc.  only one character  Casimir  ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation. The actor who plays him  Philippe Clay  is fun to watch--a really tall  skinny young man who sings  dances  and does contortions.<br /><br />The movie ends with a long cancan sequence  as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together. The dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in Moulin Rouge; in fact  if I have one complaint about French Cancan, it's that the whole thing is a little too Technicolor. Even when Nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song  the lighting is bright and flat  no shadows intruding. Yes  the result is a cheerful and warmhearted musical comedy; it's just that I can't help thinking that things weren't ever this colorful and innocent in real life.",positive
Like classic Hollywood musicals  the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Édith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale. The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan.<br /><br />Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting  but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets.<br /><br />Consider it Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions.<br /><br />,positive
This was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways  this reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40s and 50s  in that it has many clichés leading up to the inevitable conclusion (will the show STILL go on?). While of course none of this is new  it was enjoyable and well made. The musical numbers at the end are frenetic and beautiful to watch. In many ways it reminds me of a sexier version of THE GREAT ZIEGFELD. In real life  Ziegfeld was quite the player but this was sanitized in the American film. But  in FRENCH CANCAN  the characters have fully functioning libidos--but nothing is really shown  so the movie is okay for kids.<br /><br />Nothing new but well done nevertheless.,positive
I just viewed Jean Renoir's wonderful film  French Can Can. It is a visual delight and a great entertainment. The recently produced Moulin Rouge pales by comparison. I didn't quite get all of the praise that the recent movie received. Now I'm convinced more than ever  that my appraisal was correct after seeing a master film maker like Jean Renoir's version of the same story. He succeeded in getting great performances out of his entire cast  and the great French actor  Jean Gabin was in rare form. The dance sequence near the end was one of the most exciting one I'd ever seen. It was long  but I didn't want it to end. This film deserves to receive more recognition than it's got.,positive
"Jean Renoir's homage to the Paris of the late 19th century is beautiful in many ways. Not only does it appear to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha  it portrays the geographic Paris; the streets accessible only by staircases  the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity  and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell  in an uncompromising picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by Hollywood. There is an obvious comparison to be made with Lloyd Bacon's 42nd Street, which had been made about 20 years before  featuring Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation  a fresh-faced kid from the sticks who had come to New York to get into show business  who saves the show when the star fails--You're going out there a kid from the chorus, but you've got to come back a STAR!! Warner Baxter's Julian Marsh is a director who suffers for his art and is unappreciated. Jean Gabin's Danglard keeps running afoul of genital politics  but when he talks about the show he is more like Knute Rockne than like Julian Marsh. He's all about the game  except--for his pointy thing. He has a profitable new venture sewed up until his mistress become jealous of the woman whom she recognizes as his next mistress. His prospects rise and fall with every coital journey he takes. <br /><br />Danglard takes Mistress 1 (Lola de Castro  played by Maria Felix) slumming to a dive  where he sees Nini, (Françoise Arnoul) with her boyfriend and first lover  Paulo the baker  and discovers that she is a spirited dancer. He uses his charm and the prospect of money to lure Nini to studying dancing so that she may go on the stage. The prospect of money and fame charms Nini  and she become Danglard's next mistress  as well as an apt student of the cancan  which Danglard has dubbed French Cancan, to cater to the current Anglophile tendency in the dance.<br /><br />Both 42nd St and French Cancan are tributes to show business--to modern entertainment--that has is own iconography and its own conceit. 42nd St. is centered around Julian Marsh  a great director of Broadway shows  which he organizes with great personal energy and dubious sexual involvement. The male juvenile is a middle-aged twit with lumbago  replaced by Dick Powell  the pretty tenor with secret wealth to hide. Danglard  on the other hand  goes from woman to woman  seducing them with the promise of fame  hooking them with what must have been a very persuasive endowment. One has no doubt that he is heterosexual and quite active. Postcoital scenes abound.<br /><br />Days after seducing Nini away from Paulo  he has discovered Esther  a Piaf type  and begun to prepare her for her job of singing the film's theme song while he plays it on her fiddle. That of course arouses Nini's jealousy just as she has aroused the jealousy of Lola. (And of course Nini had already forsworn the privilege of being a Czarina!) The whole movie is about how Danglard's concupiscence has cost him money but how even his troublesome horniness is subordinate to his love for the show--how the audience demands devotion--and it is this potent combination of phallic persuasion and tempting fame that makes Danglard the hero  while asserting that a true lover of the show will never profit as much as the money men. At the movie's conclusion  Danglard  having outfoxed the creditors and the jealous babes  approaches a new attraction watching the incredible (and believe me  it IS incredible) performance of the cancan. Have you ever thought about being on the stage? he asks  and the curtain descends. Meanwhile  poor Julian is sitting of the fire escape of the theatre listening to Peggy Sawyer's new fans disparage his contribution to the show's success. (I won't even go into 42nd Street's central line  Oh, Guy, it was GRAND of you to COME!) <br /><br />Furthermore  I won't go into the glimpse one gets of legendary Parisian entertainers  including a brief vision of Piaf  nor of the vision of a Paris both urban and rural. Certainly there is a sample of the styles that engendered Trenet and Aznavour. But it is the memoir of an assertive and welcome masculinity  something unseen in any Hollywood musical with which it might be compared  is a pleasant relief from the androgynes of 30's Hollywood musicals (including my beloved Fred Astaire  not to mention Dick Powell)  let alone the barf promulgated by MGM in movies like the repulsive American in Paris. All those fountains! We'll save our comparison of that turkey to Breakfast at Tiffany's and its deconstruction of the American male for another day.<br /><br />That Danglard may have been a hopeful vision  in postwar France  of a kind of hyper-masculine mec that may or may not have ever existed  is practically beside the point. That he is a man's man  neither John Wayne nor Edward Everett Horton  is perhaps more on target. That he is a man who likes the ladies is never in question. I  for one  wouldn't mind living his life at all. I wonder if Gabin was that lucky. <br /><br />At the beginning of this comment I wanted to talk about Baz Luhrman and what Sinclair Lewis called boloney. I never got that far. Baz's Moulin Rouge... well  Paris doesn't put that kind of stuff in the Seine anymore.",positive
There are frames in this film that could be Renoir paintings with vivid colors against muted backgrounds. The humorous combination of sexual honesty and innocence is refreshing in this fifties film and makes palatable the old story line of the ingenue that becomes a star. The can-can number at the end seems realistic and exciting but not over the top as in an American dance sequence.,positive
Renoir's tale of Paris the Cancan a washer-girl and the Moulin Rouge.A more subdued but highly entertaining version of the opening of the Moulin Rouge. Jean Gabin gives his usual excellent performance.The Technicolor photography on the print I saw was exquisite.An easy evening's viewing. chris w galla,positive
"Although it doesn't seem very promising for a long stretch  Renoir's French Cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film. The story is cliché: a laundry girl  Nini (Françoise Arnoul)  is discovered by a night club owner  Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend  both of whom come back for their former lovers. Nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker  go on with the show with her employer  oh  or become a princess  as a prince falls in love with her at one point  too. I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice  as a lesser film certainly would have. The film ends with the opening of Danglard's new night club  the Moulin Rouge  and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers. The first of them  Complainte de la Butte, which also provides the base of most of the film's musical score  is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written  and Renoir himself wrote it. If you're a fan of Baz Luhrmann's 2001 film Moulin Rouge!  you'll recognize the tune  as it comes up near the beginning of that film  sung by Rufus Wainwright. Although it isn't very prominent in that film  everyone I know who owns the soundtrack loves it. In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written  French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen. It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl. 8/10.",positive
French Cancan is one of my favorite all time movies. It's an excellent film. There's color  there's humor  there's music. It's a very good portrait of the so called Belle Époque  though Jean Renoir's priorities were always to show a creation  a fantasie. So the film isn't a historical movie. The final sequences in which the girls dance cancan are unforgettable images. It's a film you shouldn't miss.,positive
This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties. It's the story of how Henri Danglard built and launched the Moulin Rouge nightclub; we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway  and the training of the dancers. Finally  the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing. Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are described.<br /><br />Gabin is in great form as the easy-going Danglard--see him deal humorously with Nini's violent boyfriend. Gianni Esposito is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Nini. Maria Felix  with that amazon's body  is imposing as the egotistical Lola  Danglard's first lover. Finally Françoise Arnoul as Nini the washing girl who ends up dancing for Danglard  and becoming his girl  is just stunning; her loveliness and pert charm will win you over.<br /><br />A bonus: we get Edith Piaf  Patachou  André Claveau and other stars in cameos playing the stars of a century ago who ruled over the Moulin rouge.,positive
I watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed. This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre  like Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musical  but in French way. And a Jean Renoir nice tribute to his time  his friends  lovers  music and dances. It is at same time a show business chronicle of that age  full of affection and French mood. It is too a clear tribute to the Impressionism (people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture). It is particularly a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and  of course  to Jean Renoir father  Pierre-Auguste. You will find hear a trustworthy and splendid colored recreation of some Renoir master work. Excellent casting  scenery  sound-effects and music. Even it tell us about the creation of Parisian Moulin Rouge  obviously it is a fiction story (and not very original by the way  as it fall down in the very well know moral that the show must go on). But the Jean Renoir production is great.<br /><br />,positive
Uncle Frank is everyone's uncle. This documentary covered all aspects of aging in America  the lonliness  the humor  the irony. Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were supremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the audience. The director did an unbelieveable job of capturing the small and large pieces that made up their lives. Thanks to everyone who helped in making this film!,positive
This film works on a lot of different levels. It's a profile of one very cool couple  a social commentary on aging and nursing homes  a love story  a musical. I've seen Uncle Frank a few times  and every time I watch it I'm not sure who to go call first--my parents  my wife  a friend I've lost touch with . . But it has a way of making you remember the most important relationships in your life--and want to reaffirm the ones that continue. Expect a lot of laughs  and probably some tears if any of the vibrant characters here strike a chord. I'm pretty sure they will.,positive
It doesn't matter whether you've experienced the plight of the elderly in America or if you're just plain clueless  Uncle Frank and Matthew Ginsburg give you that clue in a straight forward  funny  wake up and smell the roses sort of way. By the end of the film  it is obvious that while being totally entertained  somehow  you've also been educated. A terrific film  by a terrific up and coming talent in the movie field. Matthew Ginsburg is a name to pay attention to.,positive
The silver screen gets freshly polished with this beautiful film about aging happily and enjoying life's rainbows. There's plenty of silver hair on this silver screen  but the film's namesake is more like 85-going on-25 with his energy  humor and lust for life. The story of entertainer extraordinaire Uncle Frank  his devoted wife Aunt Tillie  and the zippy residents of the local area nursing homes inspires us to live each day as if it's your last and brings a glimmer of hope to those often-dreaded golden years. A great movie for young and old audiences!,positive
"Anatole Litvak directed the 1959 film  The Journey, starring Yul Brynner  Deborah Kerr  Robert Morley  E.G. Marshall  Anne Jackson  and Jason Robards.<br /><br />The film takes place during the 1956 Hungarian uprising and concerns a group of travelers having problems getting out of Budapest because of political problems in that part of the world. They are put on a bus to Vienna  but the Russians  led by Major Surov (Brynner) confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards)  posing as an American but in reality a Hungarian freedom fighter  whom the major believes is being smuggled out of Hungary. In fact  Lady Ashmore (Kerr) is hiding him. She becomes the focus of the Major's romantic attentions.<br /><br />Very good film that conveys the tension and hassle of the Cold War  and all of the performances are wonderful. Brynner is particularly excellent as the passionate Major who isn't all bad  and Anne Jackson gives a realistic  powerful performance as a pregnant woman who doesn't want her child born in a Communist country.<br /><br />Good script  good director  good cast - there should be more films like this. Highly recommended.",positive
Lackawanna Blues is a moving story about a boy who is raised in a house by some pretty unusual people. <br /><br />It's editing and soundtrack really pulls you in to the story and lets you experience the film the way the writer really meant for it to be seen.<br /><br />The music really tied into the story  which made the characters come to life. The editing made the story more progressive and captivating. <br /><br />I was also surprised by some of the performances of the cast  most notably S. Epatha Merkerson's.<br /><br />I can't wait to see the one man show featuring this films writer  Ruben Santiago-Hudson.,positive
There have been many excellent comments about this movie and I want to add my voice to the praise. Yul Brynner has never been more powerfully attractive. His Major Surov was riveting. Your eyes just cannot leave the screen when he's on it. This is his movie. This is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also exemplary  especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson. As they were mostly stage actors  they brought many nuances to their performances. For example  I have seen this movie at least 4 times  but this is the first time I noticed the reaction of the German girl when she came face-to-face with a Russian soldier. Even though he was not threatening  her absolutely hysterical reaction made me realize that she must have been in Germany after WWII and was most likely gang-raped by the Red Army. The possibility of discovering deeper layers of story that may lie just beneath the surface makes me want to see this fascinating film again and again. Please put it on DVD.,positive
Most people will consider that Yul Brynner's greatest performance was as the ruler of Siam in THE KING AND I. Certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in  from comic  to tragic  from eager to learn to dominating to hateful. It also showed him to advantage as a talk singer and a dancer. Finally  as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway  the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as well.<br /><br />But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I. His comic turn in ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was quite nice. So was his performance as General Bunin in ANASTASIA  or his Ramses in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet he came terribly close to being a 1950s successor to Eric Von Stroheim as the man you love to hate. A certain vulnerability in his acting and roles endeared him to the movie public  even after his best years as a star were behind him - and he retreated more and more to repeating the King of Siam on television and the stage.<br /><br />To me  his finest performance is in this 1959 drama with Deborah Kerr  Jason Robards Jr.  Robert Morley  E. G. Marshall  Anne Jackson  and Ronnie Howard. The film is set in pretty modern times - the powder-keg that was Hungary in 1956  when briefly it looked like the Iron Curtain was about to collapse there under the reforms of Hungarian patriot Imre Nagy and his supporters. But the Hungarian Revolution collapsed due to bad timing. The Russians and their Polish and East German allies sent tanks in to crush the revolt (and arrested and executed Nagy and other reformers). The West stood by and let this happen: England and France had gotten caught in the Suez crisis  and the U.S. had berated them and Israel for attacking Egypt. Due to the actions of three close allies of the U.S.  the West found it hard to condemn the overkill of the Soviet Union. It was an unfortunate situation  and the Hungarians have never forgotten how they were abandoned in it.<br /><br />In the film Brynner is Major Surov  a Russian intelligence officer who is watching for some of the leaders of the Hungarian revolt  one of whom is Paul Kedes (Jason Robards). Kedes may be getting assistance from some westerners on a bus tour through Hungary  led by Robert Morley (including Marshall  Jackson  and Howard  and Kerr). The latter are being kept in a hotel while their bus is being repaired  and Brynner mingles with them  hoping for a lead to the whereabouts of Robards. But Brynner is human - he tries to be ingratiating with these people (all of whom see him as a monster)  and in sequence  when he has drunk a little too much  he confronts them with the questions that has bothered historians since 1945: How is it (even if one notes that Russia had Stalin in charge) that relations between Russia and the West collapsed so quickly? The allies  on the whole  had worked well together from 1941 to 1945  but after Yalta and Potsdam all types of mutual suspicions just erupted. Did they have to? Surov is a good officer  but he is torn in half by loyalty to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union and in Hungary that he supports  and his growing fondness towards Kerr  who is hiding Robards but is also willing to note the more human side of the Russian major. And as the film reaches it's tragic climax  we watch as Surov has to decide if he will follow his sense of duty  or take pity on Kerr  Robards  and the other westerners who want to leave. It becomes a true struggle for him - and one that he may win far too late. It was a great film about a tragedy of post war Europe  and possibly the most thoughtful role Yul Brynner ever portrayed.,positive
Yul Brynner was a symbol of villein in the tine of 50 s   he play a role of Russian leader in Hungary at the time of revolution in this country in 1956 that made it against the Marxism.<br /><br />The script of this film made it by good taste from the writer that mixing love and adventure with showing different characters in the journey from Hungary to England.<br /><br />The best point in this film was the symbol of challenge from the Hungarian Resistance to kill the Russian major(Yul Brynner) in the hall time of the film that made a meaning about the disadvantages of this major from his bad works   but at the end he made a good work to help Deborah Kerr for escaping her and her darling to London to write in his book a good working to gain at the end people s agreement and trustment after his assassination by the Hungarian Resistance.,positive
The Journey is a very good film. Produced in the spring of 1958  in Vienna  and released in 1959  this movie was quite popular in his early years. Despite the political problems  which influenced the movie's success (because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution  the Cold War)  The Journey is a very good film  but not well-known. I think it should be released immediately on DVD  because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home. One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner  their intense relationship. All their scenes together are very important  but they also reveal the strong feelings  the great passion and love between the characters (Major Surov and Diana Ashmore). Another quality is the script  which is very well written. It was even published as a novel  by the screen player George Tabori. The film keeps its tension from the beginning to the end. At first  we didn't know if Diana and the other travelers could leave Hungary  because the Communist Major discovers that Diana's friend  Paul Kedes  is Hungarian and he isn't allowed to leave the country. The Major falls deeply in love with Diana and this is  in fact  the true reason why he doesn't want to let her go. But after he embraces her and gives her one of the most memorable kisses ever seen on screen  and she kisses him  too  he lets her go. And the end of the film is one of the most dramatic endings ever filmed-the Major and Diana say Goodbye!  she arrives at the frontier with all the travelers  including Paul  while Surov is shot several times by some Hungarians  so he dies. Yul Brynner is very  very handsome and Deborah Kerr is very beautiful  charming  refined  just like an English Lady. Yul and Deborah are perfect together. They are one of the greatest couples of the Golden Hollywood. A true moviegoer should watch this film. The Journey has everything that a good film should have-a great  captivating story  interesting characters  a wonderful direction (Anatole Litvak is  in my opinion  at his best). Finally  I want to give a message to Warner Bros. Studios or those who restore and release classic films: Please  release The Journey on DVD as soon as possible.,positive
"As a big Dostoyevsky fan  I had always been disappointed with Hollywood's halfhearted attempts to get into the Russian romantic aesthetic -- case in point  Yul Brynner as Dmitri Karamazov. I had thought the whole problem was a poor casting decisions  but then I saw Yul as Major Surov and changed my mind. When given an intelligent script to work with  he suddenly came alive and was as noble  sexy  and conflicted as you could ever want a Neurotic Russian Officer to be! So he was a better Dmitri as Major Surov than he was as Dmitri. But that's because writer Tabori actually gave Yul  as the Conflicted Russian Officer  the kind of Conflicted Russian Officer lines that are worthy of real literature  and that have real meaning and pathos in them. For example  a propos of folk music  he says musingly  You hear a man crying in the dark. And if you listen carefully enough, you know what he cries for. You look surprised, Lady Ashmore. Despite what you may have heard, tractors and Marxism aren't the only things the Russian cares for. There is always time for music.<br /><br />Brilliant!!",positive
a great movie  with a rather unclear political message. it´s shot in a theatrical style  i.c. most of the action takes place inside. mayor surov and diana ashcroft seem equally suspicious of each other. emotions run high since the western tourists and business-people seem unwilling and unable to yield to the eastern-russian charm of the mayor  although he makes every effort to understand their point of view. the two opposite world-views are made pointedly clear  but the movie also shows that human emotions cannot be controlled by politics. its powerfully acted and has a high emotional impact for a 50s movie.,positive
I really enjoy this movie. The first time it was on Turner Classic Movies. All the actors did very well but Brynner steals the show again like always ( he is so sexy!).This is one of the movie that you do see Brynner's emotions. Actually this movie this is the first I ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong  larger-than-life and serious roles in other movies. In this movie you see both a masculine  tough and sensitive side of Brynner .Brynner seems to be a ladies'man in this movie.That is amazing how Brynner eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian tongue it drives me crazy in love. I don't understand when both Brynner and Kerr ( they both have very good chemistry) stars in a movie together and then Brynner always die at the end it kind of reminds you The King and I in a way.,positive
Yul Brynner is Major Surov  a singing  dancing  vodka-drinking Russian Officer stationed near the Austrian -Hungarian border during the Hungarian uprising of 1956 in Anatole Litvak's The Journey. Though the film has yet to be released on video or DVD  it remains one of Brynner's most compelling performances. Because of the political unrest  a group of travelers cannot fly out of Budapest but are put on a bus to Vienna. Before they can reach the border  however  their passports are taken and they are detained for questioning by the Russians led by Major Surov.<br /><br />The Major has reason to suspect that there is a Hungarian freedom fighter among the group being smuggled out of the country. Indeed Lady Ashmore is hiding a mysterious passenger  Paul Fleming (Jason Robards  Jr.) who pretends to be an American but fools no one. She is helping Fleming mainly to repay a debt she owed because of the trouble her past association caused him. Among the other passengers are a British journalist played by Robert Morley  an American family played by E.G. Marshall  his wife Anne Jackson and their two children  one of which is the screen debut of little Ron Howard.<br /><br />Major Surov takes a romantic interest in Lady Diana Ashmore (Deborah Kerr)  and a romance of sorts develops between them. She offers him nothing but disdain and a stiff upper lip  however  though we suspect that underneath her heart still beats. The Cold War intrigue and the powerful acting carry the story but the romance is never quite convincing. It remains  however  one of my favorite Yul Brynner films and deserves to be seen if only for his passionate performance.,positive
I have seen several Yul Brynner films--yet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls  smiles  and laughs. Brynner might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments  Taras Bulba  The Magnificent Seven  The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Chaillot but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one. He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shot.<br /><br />Equally fascinating and sexy  without removing her clothes  is Deborah Kerr. The script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestive--she reprised this sort of role years later in The Night of Iguana. The film does not suggest that she slept with anyone to help with the release of the group from the clutches of the Russians in fact she is shown as running away from the Russian Major (in contrast to the Maupassant story or the Isak Denisen story). Yet the film bursts with suggested but real physical allure of the Kerr character.<br /><br />Kerr can never be classified as a beautiful actress in my view  but she is a superb actress. She puts her soul into dignifying the characters that she portrays  which often clashes with the spirit of the character. It is this contradiction that makes her roles in The journey  Quo Vadis  and The Night of Iguana memorable.<br /><br />Why is this an unusual film? It is not easy in Hollywood to see Russian characters portrayed as good people--Dr Zhivago was an exception. Brynner's Romance of a Horse Thief was again great cinema by Abraham Polonsky but never acknowledged as such because of the intolerance towards Leftists in the post-McCarthy era.<br /><br />The film is also unusual in its casting--great French actors Gerard Oury and Anouk Aimee--rub shoulders with Jason Robards Jr and British actor Robert Morley. In many ways the film is international than American. All four are great actors and add to the entertainment.<br /><br />Those who have read Maupassant and Denisen's works will find the film is not true to either work. Yet the film can stand on its own as its sanitized (censored?) version has a dignified charm of its own--provided by the reality of the night that led to the release of the group. I think Litvak deserves to have the last laugh in providing an interesting and plausible twist to the tales that led to the making of the film  while entwining bits of both written tales (e.g. the last bus ride and the final kiss)<br /><br />But I do have one grouse--why do Hollywood never acknowledge the sources that inspire the stories? Only recently (e.g.  Insomnia) have the original works begun to be mentioned prominently in the credits.,positive
Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956  this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria. However  three things complement the story  making this an extremely good movie.<br /><br />First  the actors use the actual languages of their roles. The Russian soldiers speak only Russian; the Hungarians only Hungarian; the Germans only German  except to the minimal extent to tell the story. Since Debra Kerr is English  she speaks only English  and  of course  Yul Brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented English. As a result  the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount. The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when he/she cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them. Very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience  and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages  the audience is never at a loss for following the film. No subtitles are necessary.<br /><br />Second. I was in Hungary in 1995  and I'm telling you  this movie has it right on. From the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes  the realism is incredible. If I didn't eat in the actual restaurant in the movie  I ate at its double. I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village. (Actually  the film was shot in Austria).<br /><br />Third  and most important  this movie reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner (after The King and I) and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified. Of course  Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship  so the Acadamy wasn't going to give him another one  but that is the quality of the film. Don't miss this one.,positive
The Journey is a romantic version of the cold war. It's about an English woman (Deborah Kerr) trying to smuggle her former love  a Hungarian scientist (Jason Robards  Jr.)  out of Hungary during the Hungary Revolt in 1956. She's on board a bus with thirteen other international people who are trying to get out of Hungary through the Austrian border.<br /><br />Of course  the bus gets stopped by the Russians for a security check. The Russian officer-in-charge (Yul Brynner) becomes attracted to the English woman (Deborah Kerr)and delays the trip. Of course  the Russian officer knows the truth about the Hungarian scientist posing as a British citizen  but he decides not to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for the English woman to come to him. Of course  this all sounds absurd  but it is a fun movie to watch. Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr. Brynner and Ms. Kerr  which seems inappropriate in the situation that they are in  the movie becomes suspenseful and interesting. The good acting overrides some of the silly dialogue. Perhaps  some people involved in the Hungarian Revolt would not appreciate this movie; they would consider it a piece of fluff. <br /><br />This is my favorite Yul Brynner role. He speaks with his own  masculine voice and is very attractive  especially when he becomes vulnerable. This is Deborah Kerr's second time working with Yul Brynner since they made The King and I in 1956. They make a very attractive couple. Too bad they never worked again. This was the second sexy role Ms. Kerr took since From Here to Eternity. Despite the fact that Ms. Kerr was wearing heavy winter clothes throughout the movie  she was very beautiful and sensual. <br /><br />The fine supporting cast was headed by Jason Robards  Jr.  in his first film role. Some of the international cast were recognizable  like for instance  Robert Morley from England. However  the rest of the actors  I have never seen before or since  were just great in the movie. In the background  it was fun to see Senta Berger  as one of the maids  speak a few lines of Hungarian. A few years later in 1966  she was in a movie  Cast a Giant Shadow  with Yul Brynner as his leading lady. She is still working today.,positive
Just a great soundtrack. Really enjoyable music. Outstanding cast  great lead performance. Worth watching.<br /><br />Doesn't really explain what happened to the neighborhood. You are left feeling that integration is to blame or that with the departure of the lead character the neighborhood disintegrated.<br /><br />This movie seems well researched and extremely well crafted. I especially enjoyed some of the minor characters like Jeffrey Wright.<br /><br />The cutting during the opening sequence helps express what a lively  engaging and desirable experience that nightclub would have been with the jump music  food  drink  dancing  gambling and sex.,positive
Set in Hungary in November 1956  this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the Uprising.<br /><br />Once the airport is closed  the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to Austria. As would be obvious  they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless Yul Brynner whose military power as a Red Army Major was marked with loneliness  his internal struggle between right and wrong  his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings. He was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike and he yearned for social contact.<br /><br />Robert Morley plays the quintessential stiff upper-lipped Englishman who  no matter how serious the role  manages to maintain an almost light-hearted logical outlook on life while Jason Robards has a stunning movie debut which enforces the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career. Deborah Kerr  as the leading lady  exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her character.<br /><br />The film deals with a very tempestuous time in European history but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover. Fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great one-liners and comedic instances that add to  rather than detract from the movie. The chemistry in the cat and mouse game between Kerr and Brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film together.<br /><br />All in all  a thoroughly engrossing movie which I would definitely watch again. 8/10,positive
"I have watch this movie almost every night that is was on HBO. It is of my opinion that it could have been successful in the theater  providing the advertisement leading up to it was top scale. I was thoroughly impressed with the actress who played Nanny. She is an outstanding actress. Of course  my favorite actor is Terrance Howard. He is a very understated actor and he deserves much more credit than he has received. Ebony magazine did do a nice article on him  giving him some of his due propers. Lakawanna Blue  gave me a understanding of the stories my parents use to tell us. They were from a similar town Philadelphia, PA were they had to have their fun in the junt joints and such. I also like to say that Mos Def is a incredible actor. He has found his calling. I've seen him in several movies where he has played a variety of roles  from thug to doctor and he has the stuff! Overall  please put Lakawanna Blues on video for rental.",positive
Very literate  intelligent drama about a group of international travelers held virtual prisoners in the Hungary of 1956 by invading Russian Communist regime. Kerr and Robards play lovers  she a British baroness  he a Hungarian freedom fighter trying to do his bit for his country. Other New York theater stars of the period Anne Jackson & E G Marshall play an American couple traveling with their two young sons  including Ronny Howard in his screen debut. Jackson's character is hugely pregnant and not anxious to give birth in a soon-to-be communist country; she gives an impassioned plea in the third act of this film which presages the naturalistic acting styles we've come to know today from Redgrave  Fonda  & Streep. Leading the pack of Soviet wolves is Yul Brynner  magnificent as a commandant and at his sexiest since he played opposite Kerr in The King and I. He is mean and nasty and terribly conflicted by his attraction to the lovely  patrician  & heroic Kerr. This is one of the great transition films of the latter part of the Golden Era of American film. Do not miss it.,positive
Good show  really good acting  and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting  unpredictable way  especially since  essentially  it's two people in a room. It doesn't race through like many modern films  but doesn't drag  either. Bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the now of her character  which is still involved and not going back on her 'career' choices - so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep  self-examination of her soul...Brundage has the delicate balance of weight  innocence  meekness  and class to pull off 'Buddy' very well. A bit grainy on the film quality  but it fits the tone of the story. Could use a little polishing on the hair and makeup end of things  but definitely worth watching.,positive
I just saw this film at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham  AL  which was actually a really fun festival  and was blown away by it. It was the best movie I saw all day by a long shot. A school aged prostitute meets with a middle age man and attempt to end there deep depression together. It's an inner look into the darkest parts of human sexuality. Story stems from real life occurrences  ripped straight from the headlines. Raw  blunt dialog and a killer twist at the end. The film does contain graphic sexual dialog and nudity. Definitely not suitable for kids. Too depressing for some people's tastes. Definitely worth checking out in my opinion though.,positive
Although it was dark  depressing  and at times hard to watch  You Are Alone held my attention and was refreshingly honest in its dialog. It truly captured the angst of teenage romantic relationships. In addition  the soundtrack was amazing. The lyrics and the tone of the songs complemented the sadness of the film so well that it made you wonder if the tracks were created specifically for the movie. <br /><br />Jessica Bohl is the best actress I have ever watched. Her compelling and believable performance made the movie. It made me wonder if she really IS a prostitute. Who knows. Anyway  the movie was very worth seeing. LOVE  YOUR SISTER! yeah  that's right....,positive
One of the BEST movies I have seen in a very long time. Bechard has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappoint.<br /><br />This movie has you guessing throughout  and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen. There are no bad guys or good guys  Bechard makes sure of that. The characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them  you care about what they have been through.<br /><br />Bechard's use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of FAST FOOD MOVIES and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable - you love the feeling it gives you.<br /><br />I have heard it said too often that there are no NEW stories to tell. Thank you Gorman Bechard for proving that false.<br /><br />Run  don't walk  to see this movie.,positive
This really is a movie that you need to see twice. When I first saw this film I was really drawn into the story. While the majority of the story takes place inside of a hotel room  the stories that Buddy (Nick Drake  wonderful allusion) and Daphne share take you outside of their room and into their world. Through their conversations you get a feel for the loneliness and pain that each feels. The soundtrack accompanies the movie perfectly  dark  lo-fi and intriguing. When you see the film the second time around you can pick up all of the clues that you missed the first time around leading up to one of the best ending I have seen in a long time. I hope to see this movie find a distributor for the DVD so that it will be more accessible. Great movie  you won't be disappointed.,positive
"I had actually considered investing in this movie when Gorman was out drumming up funding. I loved most of the script but did not like the ending. Gorman insisted the ending was as it had to be.<br /><br />Seeing the completed movie I have to say I am amazed. Reading the script I had not imagined the acting (and Gorman's directing) would be as powerful and moving as it is here. The two leads did an amazing job. They were very believable and this movie is well worth watching just for the performances of these two amazing stars.<br /><br />Now  for the spoiler and if you have not seen the movie please don't read further as you need to see the movie first. (I actually wish I had never read the script just so I could have experienced the movie ending first hand.) <br /><br />----------------------------- SPOILER <br /><br />I have two main problems with the movie. First off  and I'm sure I mentioned this when I read the script  the wife should have died. If she were dead the ending would be much more believable. As it is  we have this guy who has been agonizing over a woman who left him 'years ago.' If she left him and he is still in love after so long he'd have to be seriously delusional. But he doesn't come across that way in the script. (There is also the problem of why he did not expend all this energy going after the wife he still loves.)<br /><br />Plus  if the wife were dead we would actually be able to believe that they had a fulfilling  reciprocating love  and therefore believe that the guy is devastated enough for the ending to be reasonable.<br /><br />However  I don't buy Daphne doing what she does in the ending. I'd need a heck of a lot of convincing to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a whore but believable due to Bohl's performance) did what she did. The character is simply not cold enough. And if she did this out of some kind of love  or something else  then there is a whole piece of the movie/story missing.<br /><br />Much of this movie is reminiscent of Sex, Lies, and Video Tape. I think it could have been as popular if Gorman had chosen to give the movie a more believable ending. <br /><br />So watch the movie  enjoy the performance. And make up your own mind.",positive
I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere).<br /><br />A haunting  intimate portrait of Loneliness  and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker.<br /><br />The acting of the two leads (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) is excellent  and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged.<br /><br />Reminded me in theme of the works of Atom Egoyan (Exotica) and Raymond Carver (Where I'm Calling From).<br /><br />The Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette  Crooked Fingers) is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself.<br /><br />Highly recommend the Film and the Soundtrack.,positive
This movie is like Happiness meets Lost in Translation with a Sixth Sense ending (or maybe a Crying Game surprise)  and the best soundtrack I've probably ever heard...if that all make sense.<br /><br />The first 30 seconds pretty much tells you you're in for a twisted ride. (I was surprised no one walked out right away during the Brooklyn premiere.) But from there  the film settles down into a talk-fest between two really damaged people  Daphne and Buddy.<br /><br />They're lonely  mess-up  and boy do they talk about sex. Daphne brings to life her most interesting tales of escorting  some are quite funny (Mr. Chang) some disturbing (the Harlan scenes with music that tells us what we see might now be what's going on  or what Daphne is really feeling)  and because I have a friend who used to escort  I might add  most seem quite real. <br /><br />You Are Alone is multi-layered and mostly brilliant. Okay  maybe a couple minutes less of the talking  and I don't know that we'd have missed anything. <br /><br />Then again  I need to see it again knowing the ending.<br /><br />I like this movie.<br /><br />(The director asked people in the Brooklyn audience to write a review on IMDb because a lot of people read them. Request granted.),positive
This film is Engaging and Complex while maintaining simple beauty .Our two characters come together sharing the base of curiosity and loneliness  but it is a springboard for learning these people  they 're life styles and pasts which support this.<br /><br />The two lead actors (Bohl  Brundruge) were in the moment as any two actors I have ever seen. %100 believable  they transport the audience seemingly effortlessly  into their world. The actors' seamless acting teamed with Bechard's Beautiful  realistic dialog and his truthful direction drives the story forward into a striking and moving finale.This film is visual treat- soft  increasing the intensity of The story. The soundtrack serenades the viewer  soothing yet drawing out the emotional content of the film. I find this project to be nothing short of a masterpiece. intriguing.intense.,positive
Lackawanna Blues is and excellent movie. The casting was perfect. Every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played. Their chemistry together was amazing. The acting was superb. I felt as if i knew the characters. I could almost 'feel' them. They reminded me of people that I knew as a child growing up in the 50's and 60's. Oh  the memories!! My personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see. I have watched this movie so many times  that I can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them. I can't even list my favorite part  because I have SO MANY favorite parts. Thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that I never see in this day and age...and that is Black people loving each other  looking out for each other  respecting each other  caring about each other  and doing all we can to help each other. Gotta go now. I have to go watch it again.,positive
This was a fantastic movie about two people  one a young teenage girl  and the other  a middle aged man  who are each looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain emptiness left by former loved ones.<br /><br />Both actors give brilliant performances that various audiences can relate to. The script  although written by Gorman Bechard  seems as though it was written from a woman's point of view. And at the same time  men can relate to the male characters because of how well they were developed and described in the movie.<br /><br />The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected twist that leaves you speechless. I would recommend this film to anyone who has ever felt lonely or abandoned by a loved one. It is clear in this film that you are not alone.,positive
I am a film directors nightmare... especially of the mega buck  multiplex variety. While not a student of the art I still have a high threshold for disbelief suspension and buying into the film maker's vision  if I can find it. That's why a gem such as 'You Are Alone' is such an exhilarating find. The intimacy and pacing drew me in and never let me go. Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage give thoughtful nuanced performances and director Gorman Bechard displays a deft hand in presenting what is an understandably disturbing day in the lives of two terribly damaged people.<br /><br />Spoiler below<br /><br />I bought the DVD version and have shared it with several people. The reactions have been varied  from disbelief in the ability of Daphne to complete the assignment for which Buddy has paid her to an inability to watch the whole film because it was just too real and emotionally devastating. As a compulsively skeptical moviegoer I have to be either grabbed by the collars and hauled for the ride or sidled up to and seduced by the filmmaker. This film took the later route for me and by the end I was so involved that I felt Daphne's horror and pain at her role in Buddy's demise. My reaction to this film reminded me of watching 'The Cook  the Thief  His Wife and Her Lover' by Peter Greenaway many  many years ago. By the end I was fascinated and repelled and utterly unable to tear my eyes away from that film too. I've watched this film several times now and truly appreciate the eye and ear the director has demonstrated. I am familiar with other works he has been done including a couple of cheeky movies  'Galactic Gigolo' and 'Attack of the Killer Bimbos' and a mixed bag 'The Kiss' which I recently learned was killed in the cradle by the producer and doesn't really represent the directors vision. Too bad  because I loved the prior two films and even found 'The Kiss' interesting but wish 'The Kiss' was available in a director's cut with all of the original vision and music in tact. I look forward to future work by this interesting director and the leads Jessica Bohl and Richard Brundage.,positive
"You Are Alone is a beautiful  almost delicate film  smart directed  crisply written  with two complex and riveting performances  and a twist of an ending that no one will see coming  but will make you want to see the film a second time to go back and catch up on all the clues you misread.<br /><br />The story  about a highschool girl who drowns her depression and awkwardness by working a few hours a week as a $500 an hour schoolgirl escort  and the depressed next-door neighbor who discovers her secret and hires her for an afternoon call in a downtown New Haven hotel  features breathtaking performances from both Jessica Bohl  as the girl  and Richard Brundage  as her neighbor.<br /><br />Bohl as Daphne gives a breakthrough performance on par with Maggie Gyllenhaal in Secretary. She so captures a teenager's angst of growing into her own skin  and when she talks about always being in control  you start to realize she's not in control at all  but in danger of going over the deep end  which I guess in a way she does.<br /><br />Brundage as Buddy is depressed  angry  heartbroken  a shell of a man. But it isn't until the film's startling conclusion that you grasp a full comprehension of his pain.<br /><br />After a very brief opening segment  which will hook most independent film lovers  and have the religious right running towards the exits  we are brought into the hotel room. At first you're not sure about these people  or the film-making style. Shaky  annoying...like the characters. Until you realize their back story  told in short flashbacks. They're confrontational at first for a reason  and so is the camera. But as they open up  as the story settles down  likewise  so does the camera. And  I don't know  20 minutes in  give or take  you find yourself unable to take your eyes away from the screen.<br /><br />Having just seen the world premiere screening at the Brooklyn Film Fest -- where the director asked the audience if anyone expected the ending and not one person answered yes  I almost wish the film were already on video so I could watch it again. Because thinking back now on some of the conversations in the film  particularly a very candid dialog regarding fantasy and climax  I really thought things were going in a very different direction. But I realize now so much of their conversation meant something completely different than what I imagined. I need to see it again!!! But as dark and sexual as much of the talk is  blunt to say the least  I found myself laughing more than I might have expected at some of its candor  which definitely falls into the things we think, but lack the nerve to say out loud category. It's very blunt  especially when you realize so much of it has a completely different meaning. Some of it will make you uncomfortable  especially if you're watching You Are Alone with a partner. You'll definitely have something to talk about  perhaps argue about  afterwards. Perhaps it should come with a warning: You SHOULD be alone when watching! The music is amazing. I would have come home  and purchased the soundtrack at my favorite online music store if I could have. The film looks as good as anything shot on film. After the screening director Gorman Bechard was asked what sort of process he used to get the digital footage to look so good. His answer: none. They couldn't afford it.<br /><br />I have to give Bechard credit. I am a big fan of his two shorts  The Pretty Girl and Objects in the Mirror  but even they could not have prepared me for the complexities and surprises of this film.<br /><br />To everyone involved: bravo.",positive
Some people are born with mourning souls with their song sung singularly until they encounter another soul as tortured and/or as bitterly sweetly beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look into two tortured souls that intertwine for a moment of understanding and oneness only to be torn apart by the differences in the oneness between they're pain. Death is explored figuratively and literally. It is what happens when ones soul is dead or similarly too alive  too awake to reality. It is the life NOT which you imagined behind the eyes of passer-by's. This film explores the aching pain in us all  the frown beneath the cheery facade  the ache below. The ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and acts become honest and matter of fact and then Bechard sprinkles a dash of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix knowing both linger in us all. Bechard  the writer  is a expert observer of the human condition and because of his non judgmental attitude presents life in a light we often shield our eyes from but yearn to see and understand. He  as director  focuses on the nuances of the actors spirit that shines through the character they're playing to the actors own personal familiarity with the emotions brought on by each situation. This is the most accurately written and directed character portrayal of a man and woman's experience together I have encountered as of yet  even though the two characters encounter is probably not the normal encounter.<br /><br />The soundtrack encapsulates in each songs lyrics what the characters would let their hearts spill out if able and strong enough. It is each characters real voice sung through the beauty  pain  talent  and emotional intelligence of emerging indie artists ready to explode onto the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit that we have issues and those of us that hide it.<br /><br />I always enjoy exploring the darker sides of life with Mr. Bechard's both fascinatingly creative and realistic view of life and the characters that revolve within it.,positive
I have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was. Once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you. You Are Alone is that movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again  as if I am seeing it for the first time.<br /><br />There is nothing I did not like about the movie. Amazing soundtrack!!! The ending was perfect. Very emotionally stirring!!! It was compelling and riveting.<br /><br />I adored Jessica Bohl and her performance was the greatest I have ever witnessed. I admired Brittany's strength (what a strong woman).<br /><br />The tag line is When your darkest moments come to life. We never know what we are capable of doing. Everyone says oh I would never do that  when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation. We are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject. The honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part.<br /><br />Thank you Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art!!!!,positive
The 1980's 'My Dinner with Andre ' with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory  is essentially a dialog about the world and how it affects and can lift the spirit. 2005's 'You Are Alone' demonstrates how common worldly events can shatter the soul. <br /><br />The story revolves around three principal characters. There's Daphne  a pretty teenage student who frets about virtually every decision in her life. Then there's the prostitute  or paid escort  Britney  as self-confident as Daphne is self-conscious. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body  if not the same personae. Part of the magic of this film occurs in one of the early scenes where Daphne approaches a door of an aged hotel room. She halts and is obviously torn by the decision of whether or not to knock on the door  but it is Britney that effortlessly glides into the room when the door is opened.<br /><br />On the other side of that door is Buddy  a middle-aged nobody with few  if any  personal qualities that anyone would find attractive. He goes so far as to be confrontational about Britney's chosen profession as soon as she enters the room. However  we soon learn that Buddy is Daphne's next-door neighbor and has watched through the years as she grew from little girl to womanhood. This complicates things for the audience. Is Buddy just being a concerned neighbor or does he want something else?<br /><br />If it's sex that Buddy wants  here it is. Britney loves sex. Her definitions may be Clintonesque but that doesn't lesson her enthusiasm. She prefers older men and wears a rainbow of plastic wristbands that her clients are invited to chose from. Each color band denotes a specific act that she'll perform  but exactly which act isn't revealed until after the band is broken off her wrist and the choice is irrevocably made. <br /><br />Britney is  or believes that she is  in control of every encounter. Even when blindfolded and bound  as she is by one of her regular clients  she imagines her arms and body being stroked by multiple men but her legs and pubic area being caressed by a woman in blood red lingerie. The film's imagery just keeps coming.<br /><br />Buddy's pathetic life is one of acceptance. He's lost his wife  his dog  even his fantasies of the pretty teenager next-door. It's no coincidence that he's lured Daphne or Britney to this particular hotel room. There's a painting on the wall of a dinner plate with only a fish head left. This is a perfect metaphor for Buddy's life; all of the good parts are finished. So it's here  where he brought his wife when they were still college students  that he makes his stand  to regain some control of his own life  to make his statement.<br /><br />The director of 'You Are Alone ' Gorman Bechard  knows his craft. The principal action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film  assisted by a myriad of inter-cut scenes that add dimension to the characters  their circumstances and conflicts.<br /><br />As the film progresses  Britney asks Buddy if she should get undressed. He says yes  but she strips only to her underwear. An actual prostitute would probably remove all of her clothes (one of the profession's five gets). But it isn't Buddy that's being teased  we are. As the film concludes  we find that there are far deeper human emotions and motivations in play. A tease doesn't work unless it actually delivers. Britney does  so does 'You Are Alone'.,positive
The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast. The quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there The screenplay is intense and does not wander. The plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending. We showed this film to a small group of patrons at Gadsden's Center for Cultural Arts. After the film  ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still bothered. While we put an 18 and up age restriction on the film  I would watch the film with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and sets the stage for great conversation.,positive
I caught this at the Chicago IndieFest and have to say YOU ARE ALONE is a lot funnier than the other reviews and even the website would lead you to think. Not HA HA Wedding Crashers' funny  but sick  twisted  I can't believe she just said that but it's so damn true funny.<br /><br />Jessica Bohl  who deservedly won Best Actress  is amazing to watch. There's never a moment when you think oh  I'm watching a movie and she's an actress. She's too damn real for words.<br /><br />In fact there's 2 scenes that I'm still giggling over  and I won't give them away  but in one she's in the bathroom talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how awesome it is. (I almost wonder how many people in the audience are secretly thinking the same thing!!!) <br /><br />In another she talks about a teenagers definition of sex versus an adults  and if it isn't the truest dialog I've heard in a movie in a long time  I don't know what is.,positive
Jessica Bohl plays Daphne  the sexually precocious suburban teenager struggling with the hell of high school. Daphne's neighbor is Buddy (Richard Brundage)  a depressed middle-aged man still angry over loosing his wife. Daphne is attracted to world of prostitution because it promises to cure her of barely legal boredom and loneliness. Once Buddy strips Daphne of her secret  he hires her to help him accept the loss of his wife. The entire film takes place at the Hotel Duncan  yet details of each character's history are exposed through dialogue and flashbacks. Their appointment climaxes with the story's concluding twist.<br /><br />Both actors truly understand and become their particular character  delivering a convincing  sincere performance. Their on-screen chemistry  critical to the entire film  is genuine.<br /><br />The film's dialogue is natural  real to life. The writer  Gorman Bechard  undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate. Daphne is intelligent  yet clearly still an eighteen year old. Buddy may be middle-aged  but still not the hackneyed naïve type normally depicted in film. Daphne and Buddy's conversation primarily deals with their despair and frustration with life  but is still comical at the right times. Although the general mood is very relaxed  the dialogue has its own vivacity  forcing the audience to become empathetic toward the character's conditions and uncomfortable at their straightforward vulgarities.<br /><br />The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film. Each track commands sentiment  actually contributing to the scenes and characters. Even existing independently from the film  the compilation truly expresses You Are Alone's central theme-- loneliness.<br /><br />You Are Alone is a less conventional piece that deals with of notions typically not spoken. Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.,positive
If you're tired by the same repetitive  unintelligent material that the mainstream movie industry releases  you'll enjoy You Are Alone. It is thought provoking  well shot and riveting.<br /><br />Without revealing anything that you don't find out in the first few minutes of the movie  this is the story of a young white high school girl from an upper middle class environment who is working as an escort and is discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of the movie occurs in a hotel room where he hired her to come.<br /><br />Through their discussion  you explore two shifting views of prostitution  depression  loneliness. Yet the movie is not depressing. It talks about dark things without being depressing.<br /><br />As a viewer  your emotions and preconceived notions are moved around  but gently. You come out of it with a lot to think about. I like that in a movie.,positive
If you want to see a brilliant performance of Mikado  played to perfection with expert timing and panache  don't watch this version. If you want to see a hammy version with Eric Idle strutting around in 1930's english gentlemen's private club society  this is the one to watch. It's a lot of fun and a good intro to Gilbert and Sullivan  but after this  rush out and rent the Canadian Stratford version. You'll see the difference between good and great. Nobody does G&S better than Brian McDonald and the Stratford group.,positive
"There are times I am convinced that The Mikado is the best Sullivan & Gilbert opera ever  but that is only so long as I'm not listening to Iolanthe. Be that as it may  The Mikado is probably the most frequently filmed of the Savoy Operas. (Yes  I put the composer first. Nobody says Hammerstein and Rodgers  or Hart and Rodgers  or Boito and Verdi  or What's-His-Face and Strauss. You don't even hear the names of librettists for Offenbach  Suppe  or Balfe. Gilbert was just the bigger name (and the bigger ego) at the time  so they put his name first. It's time that silly practice was put to rest.<br /><br />Anyway  The Mikado is a compleat S&G operetta. It has some of Sullivan's catchiest numbers  combined with some of Gilbert's cleverest lyrics. It has an interesting book and sprightly dialogue. It's got a wonderful degree of craziness. And it leaves the door wide open for elaborate and whimsical costuming.<br /><br />This particular production  filmed in a live performance in 1990  turns its imagination toward striking simplicity. Set in a British seaside resort toward the end of the Art Nouveau period  it throws over the japonerie of the original entirely. The result is costuming and setting in an eye-caressing medley of whites  grey  and blacks  accented by occasional bits of red (and less frequent uses of yellow and green). It takes some getting used to  but it's really spiffy. Of course  when the chorus tells you they are gentlemen of Japan  you would be right to exclaim  Oh, pooh. Bah! (Did I just say that?) It's most gratifying that this fine production is now on DVD. However  one caveat: the print seems to be photographed through a glass of imperfect clarity  so that the expected sharpness of the image is softened and ever so slightly fuzzy. The tendency to superimpose images is  alas  annoying. Why do people who are doing a really spiffy production want to muck it up with artsy-fartsy stuff of that sort? But it's the performance that counts the most. We may skip the overture  since although one is performed  Sullivan never wrote one. (True  it may be so he wrote none for any of the Savoys. But the Mikado overture doesn't even date from Sullivan's lifetime and was compiled by observing the techniques used in the others.) As for the rest of the operetta  it's first-rate and supremely funny.<br /><br />The Ko-Ko here is the estimable Eric Idle  who does it credit. There is a tradition of bringing a Big Name into the role. The was a U.S. TV production years ago in which Ko-Ko was played by Groucho Marx with mixed results. Idle's performance is delightfully quirky ... he does Taken from a county jail assisted by a tennis racquet. His I've Got a Little List is done as a speech to a microphone -- of course it has the usual updated lyrics  which are much funnier than the usual run of such things  and his delivery is positively hysterical. It goes on that way throughout.<br /><br />In this operetta  it's important to have a good Katisha; it's just no fun if you're not being bellowed at in style. This Mikado has a fabulous Katisha in Felicity Palmer  in her way almost as Big a Name as Idle. She bellows with the best of them in a wonderful rich contralto ... wonderful  especially  for a soprano. And her costume...!!! (Not to mention her recital with Franz Liszt  apparently  accompanying.) Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone. I have trouble getting around is somewhat un-Nanki-Pooish chubby shortness -- but is voice is undeniably a solid  rich addition to the vocal palette. There is a nice touch during A Wand'ring Minstrel  where the chorus reacts with distaste to the mention of his nancy on his knee -- bear in mind the Mikado's decree about flirting. Be that as it may  Bottone is a fine singing actor and if his appearance doesn't put the best face on Nanki-Poo  his performance does.<br /><br />Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are appropriately pretty and silly. She and Bottone do lovely duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his persona as something a blageur and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful as a stuffed shirt out of water ... a role later done to death in American sitcoms (you know: haughty butlers forced to cater to bratty children -- that sort of thing). The Mikado (Richard Angas) is bloody marvelous  with an imperious voice at absolute variance with his ridiculous lyrics.<br /><br />I don't recommend you get this as your only Mikado. Get a good traditional production as well  so you can see what Gilbert intended (more or less) in terms of staging. That being said  I'll watch this one twice while viewing any traditional bit once. On the whole this is a terrific offering  a vocal and visual delight  with delicious over-acting. It's a DVD to treasure  with dervish-like maids  tap-dancing bellhops  and all. Watch for the bellhops with signs.",positive
I first saw this on Thames television and loved it. I subsequently saw a dreadful write-up by someone who certainly hadn't watched or listened to it. So  I bought a copy and then I bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL VHS or Region 2 DVD. The Australian version is great  but this one is better! I might buy another.............,positive
I really enjoy this particular production of The Mikado. The producers added a few touches throughout to make it more amusing for modern audiences -- for instance  As Some Day It May Happen (the little list song) is completely updated  and a few lines are ad-libbed throughout the play. Liberties were also taken with the setting. The costumes are not Japanese  but rather 1920s English (although some of the Tittipudlian girls wear '20s-inspired kimonos). This production is well-choreographed with some 1920s dance styles  and there are some extra dancing maids and bellhops to keep your eyes (as well as ears) entertained during the songs. If you're a Gilbert & Sullivan purist these changes may bother you  but I think they're fine -- and I love the costumes! <br /><br />Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely hilarious; all of her scenes make me laugh out loud (one of my favorite add-ons is when she first makes an entrance -- the dancing bellhops annoy her with their antics  so she screeches at the top of her voice  STOP IT!!!). All of the other main characters do a fine job as well. I particularly like Mark Richardson as Pish-Tush (that toupee!) and Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum.<br /><br />You must keep in mind that this is a stage production being filmed and set your expectations accordingly. There is no change of setting  although the filmmakers used some 1930s film techniques to add interest. If there is one draw-back to this production  it is that the stage makeup wasn't modified for close-up shots with a camera. Foundation lines are often visible and there seems to be a surplus of eyeliner  lipstick  and blush everywhere. I've seen this sort of thing happen before with films of plays  and it's a little jarring at first. However  I hope you'll get used to it and enjoy The Mikado for what it's worth -- a thoroughly enjoyable rendition of a classic!,positive
Cowboys and Indians is an excellent film. The writing  acting  directing could not have been better. This was a story that begged to be told  and this group of talented individuals and teams did a superb job of doing so. Stories like this one are not pleasant ones  but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all around the world. It is my hope that when this film is seen that attitudes and prejudices will be changed. A film that can do that is a rare a special thing. Andrew Berzins is an excellent writer  and his talents and expertise in this field came shining through in this film. <br /><br />Thank you for telling this story!!!<br /><br />Ruby,positive
I just watched it for the second time today and I must say with all my heart it is about damn time they made a movie about us as people not as spiritual beings. Such a waste of human life as this story was maybe some good will come out of it. And Eric is hotter than ever. To often in the movies First Nations people are seen as other than everyday people. We are always portrayed as chiefs or medicine people. Hey we are just like everyone else. And this movie showed just that. We hurt when an injustice is done and we can win in quest for justice. It is really to bad that the big movie companies cant see that. I cant wait till this comes out on DVD. Thanks to those who chose to show this story as it really was.,positive
I grew up in Winnipeg and saw the treatment of the natives almost everyday. There are good and bad in EVERY race  why make them all out to be bad? That goes for all races today. John Harper was an educated man  he graduated from high school  he even had a year of university under his belt before going back to the reserve. How do I know this? John Harper lived with my family for the 3 years he was in high school  and he kept in contact with us the year after graduation. He was a kind and gentle soul  he could be fun loving and he could be serious when the times were right. I wasn't very old when he left our house  but I can still remember all the times he helped me with my homework when my own brother couldn't be bothered. He even taught grade 3 the year before he came to Winnipeg. None of this is mentioned in the movie  and the suicide of constable cross is an admission of guilt as far as I'm concerned. What happened to John is unforgivable  not only in the native community  but also in the white community. Not everyone in Winnipeg think like the police do  I knew the person inside  and what he was like as a PERSON  not an Indian!,positive
The real life case of an innocent First Nations chief(the Indian) by an Winnipeg city officer(the Cowboy) is the basis of this TV movie. The actual case caused its fair share of racial tension in Canada  a small scale Martin Luther King thing. The misjustice of First Nations people is becoming a staple in the Canadian cinema diet. What makes this film worth viewing is the focus on the family's reactions. The father played by Gordon Tootoosis demands forgiveness and the brother played by Eric Schweig demands justice. The stars Gordon Tootoosis and Adam Beach(WINDTALKERS  SKINWALKERS)have minor  almost cameo  appearances. Soon-to-be star Eric Schweig makes his mark in this film with a powerful performance. An honourable mention goes to veteran actor Gary Chalk who has chalked up over 100 movies to his credit. His portrayal of the troubled soul Inspector Dowson was worthy of a Gemini Award(the Canadian Emmy)along with Eric Schweig. The special effects(jump cuts  dream sequences) are occasional and not overbearing. Couple this with some beautiful northern Canadian scenery and recent ongoing events involving police officers and First Nations people like the Neil Stonechild case  and you have a very rewarding and relevant viewing experience.,positive
Blade was a thrilling horror masterpiece and it was a brilliant movie with real great action  I cant wait for Blade 2  This is one of Wesley Snipes greatest movies  the acting is great the story line is great everything about this movie is great.,positive
I watch Lackawanna Blues every time it comes on. It brings back happy times for me. I grow up in a big city in the mid-west. It reminds me of when I was a child although my situation was a little different it feels the same. It makes me wonder if all we will ever know about families are lost. The big mama's of day are under the age of 55. Will they see know what it takes to be a inspiration to other. I hope that I was not the only one who loved this movie enough to relate it to their past. The music was great in this movie. I truly felt like this should have gone to the theaters I would have paid to see it. As I viewed the movie for the second time I figured out who life this movie was about. He did an superb job in writing and producing this film. I guess who better to produce a film based on your life other than you. As soon as I can I will be obtaining a copy for my home use. I alway enjoy black producer or directors they make such film feel like you were actually living in the time right than. Thanks for such a great movie.,positive
Okay  sure  this movie is a bit on the hokey side. It's difficult to take characters from comic books and put them into movies with any credibility (Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher  anyone?)  but this tries very hard. I've never read the actual comic book  but that doesn't really matter  I suppose. I judge a film mainly on its merits  not on whether it is a faithful retelling of someone else's idea. (Unless its a film based on a true story  that demands at least some attempt at truth and accuracy.) So why will I give this movie a fairly high rating? Because it tries. It tries very hard. In my book  that makes it a fair attempt at an entertaining film.<br /><br />Many films have been made with vampire subject matter being the main focus. It seems everybody has their take on vampire lore  be it the cross  the silver  the garlic  the aversion to sunlight  whatever. Some of those ideas are included here. The storyline is familiar... a group of vampires conspire to take over the world  with one person (mainly) standing in their way. Blade (Wesley Snipes) lives for the sole purpose of the destruction of the vampiric masses  who have slowly but surely moved into the world  and share it with humankind. For the most part  the human race is blind to the fact that vampires exist all around them. The vampires have even taken familiars  people who aspire to be vampires and do the vampires' dirty work for them to show how worthy they are of eventually being turned.<br /><br />Now that I think of it  there are many elements of this movie similar to the storyline of the Roddy Piper film  They Live. A hidden enemy  hidden group of people plotting against them  the fight to save human-kind... all that is present in Blade as well.<br /><br />The acting isn't the best here. Snipes is  at best  only slightly better than some of his other roles; N'Bushe Wright  a relative newcomer  isn't too bad; Kris Kristofferson is forgettable as Blade's sidekick (he's to Blade what Chip is to The Punisher). Stephen Dorff does the best job of the whole cast here  as the head vampire you just love to hate.<br /><br />I don't know  but I just loved the special effects in this film. From the blood-soaked vampire-style rave  all the way to the inevitable fight at the finale of the film  the special effects aren't half bad. There's certainly enough blood and gore to go around  but after all  this is a vampire movie  right? The various shapes and sorts of weaponry Blade uses are fairly unique  and not generally used in contemporary action films. Snipes has more flair with a decked-out sword than he does with  say  a machine gun. Plus  there's so much more thought that goes into fighting with a blade than just blowing someone away. (Unless  of course  you are Indiana Jones.)<br /><br />Overall  this isn't the best action film ever made  but it's not half bad  either. As a bonus  the musical score & soundtrack are pretty cool  too. Tell me  in what other movies can you hear super drum'n'bass like Source Direct or Photek?!<br /><br />My Rating: 8/10,positive
Lackawanna Blues is a very moving film depicting an era filled with varying emotions and characters as seen through the eyes of a young boy. The film clearly supports it takes a village to raise a child and reminds of an important time in black history and culture. I gained an incredible amount of respect for Macy Gray as an actress. Her character was a little crazy  yet lovable; clearly we all have known someone like Macy's character. S. Epatha Merkerson is absolutely fantastic as Nanny. I never realized that Epatha was such a great actress. Law & Order never showcased the depth of Epatha's acting abilities like Lackawanna Blues. I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! The music and the characters reminded me of my own childhood...it was a sweet nostalgic walk down memory lane. I truly enjoyed the film and eagerly await the DVD release to add to my collection.,positive
hi<br /><br />Blade is an sensational action movie . the hero (Wesley Snipes) and the villain have done justice to their roles.<br /><br />The movie's action sequences are better then Matrix! <br /><br />Wesley Snipes is one the best action heroes ever.<br /><br />If u like action/vampire movies   this is the ONE.<br /><br />the theme is pretty good considering the fact that so many vampire movies have been made before.But these is the best of them.<br /><br />Enjoy the Ride.,positive
It's got action and fantasy mixed all together what more do you want in an action movie? And it also has one of the best martial artists in the movie industry today  Wesley snipes.So all in all this movie hasn't left anything out. And that's my comment of what I think is a classic beat em up movie.,positive
Not being the least bit familiar with the characters from the comic book series  I expected this film to merely accomplish the basic: introduce me to the characters and their inherent characteristics  present a plot  and end with the destruction of the main adversary and perhaps hint at the possibility of a sequel. And that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver.<br /><br />However  unlike with most other comic book movies  I felt that this one did it with a bit of class. Risking a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fight scenes  Blade presents a very modern  believable and dismal world whose little nuances effectively managed to elicit a sense of dread--as minor as it may have been--from a viewer who rarely ever becomes involved in a story unless an emotional (i.e.  sappy) aspect is concerned.<br /><br />Yes  the movie has innumerable plotholes  and preposterously unrealistic situations such as a standard female doctor being astute enough to contrive what no one else has been able to for several thousand years. But when you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie  and fight scenes with involving and exciting camera cuts and special effects such as this  what else matters? It may run a little long  but for what it sets out to do  Blade stands out in sharp relief among most other movies in this genre.,positive
In this film I prefer Deacon Frost. He's so sexy! I love his glacial eyes! I like Stephen Dorff and the vampires  so I went to see it. I hope to see a gothic film with him. Blade it was very about the future. If vampires had been real  I would be turned by Frost!,positive
Blade is probably one of the best vampire/action movies ever made.It has it all:action horror blood.this movie is for action fans.It's either you like it a lot either you hate it and if you hate it  it means you don't like action or vampires movies.Wesley snipes takes his role seriously and he his the perfect guy for blade,positive
Great underrated movie great action good actors and a wonderful story line. Wesley is verry good and the villain the bad guy is wonderful The girl plays a nice role and the comedy mixed with blakness!,positive
I loved it. In fact  I watched it over and over and over  and I could watch it again. This movie doesn't get boring.<br /><br />The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie. It's a job well done  great for today's generation.<br /><br />Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover  mmmm mmm  she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue provides great comical relief.<br /><br />This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.,positive
this film was brilliant! i absolutely loved it! wesley snipes was great for this role - and i'm sure blade 2 would be just as good.<br /><br />blade is by far one of my favorite action/horror movies out there! and if you havent seen it yet  and like vampires and blood (all that stuff) you should really rent it  because i assure you that you'll love it!,positive
I remember seeing this one in the theatres when it came out  having no idea what it was going to be about and being so pleasantly surprised that I vowed to buy the video when it came out. <br /><br />While I won't go too far into dissecting this film  I will say that I gave it an 8/10  for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews.<br /><br />What I will say is this: <br /><br />The first 10 minutes of this film are incredible. It's as close to a textbook audience grabber as I've ever seen. I once put this movie on at a party  where everyone was winding down and getting ready to leave. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes.<br /><br />Everyone  who watched the opening  stayed to the end.,positive
This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it. It is by far one of the best comic book adaptations ever. I liked this one even more than X-men. In fact  this movie is sort of a cross between X-men and the matrix and it came out before either. Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade. He is just not an emotionless super hero. Also  this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Sure comic books are for kids mainly  but I like a little more in my movies. Let's face it  if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic. This comic book adaptation also has something that many don't. A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy. Let's face it  none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight.,positive
Fantastically written  acted  and produced! Loved seeing this gleaming  talented cast -- every single one of them -- give a such great performance. This movie thoroughly warmed the cockles of my heart! Great storytelling!<br /><br />This is a great movie for Black History month. Full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who weathered incredible pain -- with dignity and a belief in a better future. It is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adulthood. The next time you're in the company of a listening and observing child  remember; show or he may be a writer-in-the-making!,positive
This film is superb! Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class  he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud. The movie is a fast paced  thrill ride of action and superb stunts. The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads. The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too. Wesley should have done more action films than he has  i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all  only Bruce Willis  Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise (if he counts as an action star) come close. Also aswell as Wesley being quality  Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy. It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing  but he does. Overall the film is sharp  stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace.,positive
Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn - fast  loud and moody. Despite my initial fears Kris K carries his part reasonably well and Snipes aka Blade provides a formidable physical presence. Lots of blood  steel  silver  burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable :) 110 minute distraction. IF you like the black look of The Matrix then Blade will appeal to you  Blade even has a 'dodge the bullets' sequence.,positive
For a brief moment. The opening scene with Traci Lords and the<br /><br />techno bar is incredible. I'd probably follow her to my ultimate death too! Best vampire movie of all time but with a twist. The fight scenes are awesome. Wesley Snipes displays an athleticism you dont get to see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very believable as an ambitious new recruit moving himself up the hierarchy by any means necessary. Great flick 9/10. Where's Blade II?,positive
However closely the movie is to the comics  it doesn't matter. This movie radically moves away from the boredom of Interview with the Vampire (although it's acting was good) and slides in the wonderful action scenes. Very convincing tale and interesting with surprisingly good acting from all. Disadvantage - poor graphics. Does it matter? Nope.,positive
In the ever growing film genre of comic book adaptations  Blade is by far one of the best realised  and most faithful (overall) to the source material.... given that the character has almost 30 years of history in the comics since his debut as a back up figure in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula  the writer took almost ALL of the characters and plot elements from the comic's history. While changes were inevitably made  the finer points of the film steamroll right over any criticisms. Don't let any of you friends tell you different: Blade is one fine film. If it feels too comic booky for you Stanley Kubrick snobs out there  it's because it's supposed to. Deal with it  but don't dis it for it.,positive
Blade is a dark  gloomy  but significent vampire movie and is one of the best ones. A bit of gore  but nothing really that bad. Wesley snipes played a strong role as he eliminates the vampires. Not really like buffy  because thats too tame but Blade delivers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie that you would probably like to watch on a dark stormy night....thats at best viewing!<br /><br />87%,positive
"Overall  I give this film a decent 7.6. To start I'll say I love how the character was portrayed and adapted on to the screen. If you read comics occasionally or simply watch DVD extras you'll see the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the film. Among the changes  Blade is now most importantly half vampire  therefore acquiring all of their strengths, but none of their weaknesses. The credit for this goes obviously to David Goyer  a fellow fan of the darker genre of comic books. Thanks to him Blade has become a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really. Wesley Snipes is born to play this role  although some would've probably pererred Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His acting here doesn't need to be exactly Oscar winning per say considering the character but I'm glad he decids to play the DayWalker in the two sequels. Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our main villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred so to speak. The acting is good actually and the action keeps the plot going for sure. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts I've got to say. As much as like this movie there are few things that bother me which take away from this film ranking with something like Spider-Man or X-Men. Stephen Norrington had the villains portrayed in a way I didn't like so much honestly. Their lines were so full of foul mouthed comedy it didn't really feel like a comic book film to me. Plus La Magra a bit disappointing as the final villain but the intense sword fight makes up for it I guess. Not to mention a sense of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather coat with a sword beaing the #$%^ out of a cop in broad day light some how going unnoticed by the crowds walking by seemed kinda..well...dumb. Moving away from a few of its flaws  the music by Mark Isham was great and fitted the film nicely. Luckily all these problems are fixed and improved on in the stunning sequel  Blade 2.",positive
'Blade' would be an extremely above-average comic-book  vampire-hunter action/horror if it weren't for two minor flaws. #1 I loved seeing the all-but invincible Blade/Snipes do his slicing and dicing  but the whole Yes! fist/punch was literally a letdown. #2 Bad  no make that horrible  CGI  even for 1998 standards. This is mainly in the last third  but some sprinkled throughout. Okay  despite those minor infractions  I really enjoyed this movie. All actors did a suburb job and the fact that this now looks like yet another 'Matrix' rip-off is hilarious considering this came out one year prior. So maybe 'The Matrix' copied 'Blade.' At any rate  it's a very movie for multiple genre-loving audiences: Comic Book geeks  action fanatics and horror/vampire lovers. So  we have Blade  half-man/half-vampire  or day-walker and his accomplish  Whisler (a la Batman and Alfred) battling the undead who  apparently almost out number humans. Who knew? In a rare act of humanity (Blade's more of an antihero) our sword ninja/vamp rescues a newly infected (coincidentally) blood specialist/doctor. Meanwhile  trouble brews amongst the vampires as one wants (you guessed it) supreme power and needs Blade somehow to obtain it. It's not the most original concept  if you read what I just wrote  but still highly enjoyable. You will want to see Blade succeed  you will root for him despite his imperfections and mannerisms. And you will know what's coming as this is the typical act 1-2-3 of a comic book introduction movie. Still  watch this without trying to go too deep. Such as Vampire SPF-1000 suntan lotion? Really? What about the scalp? Wouldn't that still burn? Just like the money they burn for weapons? Uh  okay  I am going too deep. Once again  sit back and enjoy the techno-charged fun ride.,positive
Hope the summary line won't irritate you that much (it's a little homage to the Chappelle Show/Charlie Murphy  but also to the character Daywalker). But I'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I didn't like in another paragraph  so it will be easier to read! <br /><br />Let's start with the good things! The quote strong bloody violence (which is used by rating boards  to describe the content of a movie  does fit here very well. This is not a movie for kids! Or for the faint of hearted! It has Blade as a central character (Wesley Snipes is phenomenal) and a crazy enough story thread to hold/justify the action scenes! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent. The action scenes are great here too.<br /><br />OK over to the things I didn't like. The overall story is too thin. It's enough as I've written above to hold the action scenes together  but there could be more. And a character like Blade deserves more (imo). The drama therefor isn't the best ... also it's use of clichés doesn't help. Some characters are underwritten ... That's that! :o),positive
I admit I go more for the traditional vampire tale  but this one is a real winner. Lots of way out graphics and good story to go with them made for an interesting 2 hours. There was loads of gore with vicious blood suckers attacking mortals and even each other for control of the world. A good one for all us vampire lovers.,positive
This was absolutely one of the best movies I've seen. <br /><br />Excellent performances from a marvelous A-List cast that will move you from smiles to laughter to tears and back.<br /><br />I couldn't help but care about the characters. Ms. Merkerson will blow you away  as will the young man playing the young lead.<br /><br />I also thought that the set design was top-rate. The viewer is really placed inside each era as it's presented. <br /><br />The music is a blast  too. Nice selections to represent mood  time and place. The blind blues man is stereotypic but he delivers some great songs. <br /><br />This is a great story that will survive many repeated viewings. Take the time to watch it!,positive
It seems to me that a lot of people don't know that Blade is actually a superhero movie on par with X-Men  Daredevil  Punisher and the likes. What all these heroes (and in the case of X-Men hero group) have in common is that they were all conceived in the magical world of Marvel. Blade was originally a normal person (in a blue outfit) who chased vampires because of a personal grudge and eventually facing of with Dracula himself and he was for lack of a better word boring. So boring in fact that the character was shelved and in fact never used in the Marvel universe. At least until he was reinvented.<br /><br />David Goyer did a stroke of genius when he took the character of Blade and turned him into a leather clad dark knight. He can't take all the credit though and much of this must go to Stephen Norrington as well who with his distinct visual style brings out the best of the character. The Blade character (Wesley Snipes) is pretty amazing in this film and mixes martial arts with Batman like darkness. Snipes is pretty good as the title character and is successful in bringing out the duality and inner demons of the character. He is  however  a pretty rigid actor both in voice and in posture and is only interesting enough for one film (which is clearly seen from the inferior sequels). Kris Kristofferson is good as well and really brings the tormented character of Whistler to life with energy and sense of timing. N'Bushe Wright  however  is fairly weak as a leading lady making her character relatively flat and lifeless. Donal Logue is pretty funny and manages to do a lot with a minor character. German  Udo Kier  should also be mentioned as he brings a lot of finesse and style to the vampire race  probably born of his experiences from playing Dracula. Stephen Dorf provides the best acting in the film and his chilling performance as Deacon Frost stands as one of the best screen villains I have perhaps ever seen.<br /><br />The story is good and  I feel  renews the vampire genre (something that hasn't been done since Robert Rodrigues' From Dusk Till Dawn) by adding a lot of contemporary elements and maintaining the comic book feel. By saying that the film has a comic book feel does not mean that the film is unrealistic. Far from it. A lot of effort has been put in trying to make the film seem as real as possible. Including the effects which are pretty good for their time. I found the vampire dustings to be a very nice touch. In stead of adding a lot of blood when a vampire dies Norrington chose to let the vampires spontaneously com-bust which looks great. The fact that the overall effects were well done adds to the credibility of the film which would otherwise have fallen flat on its face.<br /><br />As previously stated Norrington has a very distinct visual style that sets him apart from the directors of the following Blade movies. Del Toro is nearly as skilled but I prefer Norrington's style. His style gives the film a very special look and feel but most importantly it gives the film atmosphere. A very tense dark atmosphere which works great in tune with the main character and story. Along with the visual style the music which also works fine and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the movie.<br /><br />All in all Blade is a very entertaining movie that should probably have had an 8 from me but a few annoying flaws (which cannot be revealed without spoiling the movie  suffice to say  many of them are located near the ending of the film) does that the film must settle with a high 7.<br /><br />7/10,positive
Wesley Snipes is perfectly cast as Blade  a half human  half vampire known the daywalker. He has all their strengths and his only weakness is the thirst for blood. Since he teamed up with whistler (Kris Kristofferson) he has hunted down vampires who have lived amongst us unnoticed for centuries  but omnipotent overlord Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) is tired of living in harmony with the humans (Food as he calls them) and he plans to waken the blood god and take control of the world.<br /><br />This movie is well cast  written and directed; ensuring the viewer has a thrilling ride from start to finish. Packed with great fight sequences and slick dialogue  Blade is certainly more action than horror  but it definitely delivers.<br /><br />8/10,positive
If you like horror or action watch this film ASAP. If the opening scene doesn't get your adrenaline pumping then someone should check your pulse. Great Action  excellent casting and top one-liners. This is the only film I have seen in a cinema where the crowd applauded each chop  kick & punch thrown. Not perfection but who cares when films can be this much fun. Its a pure rush of dark comic book action. 9/10,positive
Blade is a fantastic action/thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet.<br /><br />This film has everything that you would ask for in an action/thriller  it has plenty of blood  guts and gore  a twisted  disturbed bad buy  moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists.<br /><br />Their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects  Wesley Snipes fighting movement is fantastic.<br /><br />This film is in my opinion a must see  Wesley Snipes cool  solid appearance makes this film and I can't wait for the sequel 'BLADE 2' being released next year.<br /><br />My IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10,positive
"Now here is a movie that does something that hasn't been done in a long time. It take ten or so different elements that we're already familiar with (Vampires  martial arts  a techno beat  top-o-the-line special effects  etc.)  and turns it into something that feels brand new. In what could have easily been merely a combination of Mortal Kombat and Buffy: The Vampire Slayer, Wesley Snipes (no favorite of mine since and mostly because of Passenger 57) gives a really good turn as the half human/ half bloodsucker. He acknowledges the internal conflict  but doesn't dwell on it more than necessary. He makes Blade as deep a character as Michael Keaton made Batman.<br /><br />I'll say that the only part of the movie that got me a little miffed was the always present horror movie cliche of that one person that the hero happens to know who happens to know exactly how to stop the evil guy. On the other hand  you sort of have to have that in a movie like this  so it's easily excusable.<br /><br />Well  Snipes is good. And Steven Dorff  hyped in the previews  makes a more than bad enough bad guy to Snipes' hero. He's got class  presence  and enough control in his little pinky to teach Al Pacino how to tone it down a bit. Who would ever think that a comic book movie would be a launching pad for an actor? I sincerely hope this is. And whoa! where the heck did Kris Kristofferson get acting talent? Don't get me wrong  but the prolific actor hasn't done anything memorable since Millennium, and how many of us watched that just 'cause of the cool video box? Well  here he is  folks  in a very Obi-wanish turn  as Blade's mentor and father figure. And good job  too.<br /><br />The quality of the acting is matched by the quality of the choreography and special effects. Accompanied by a pulsing techno beat  the fight scenes brings back and quickly banish memories of Mortal Kombat. Hey! It had a script  too! I was wondering what had happened to all the good writers out there.<br /><br />The two major indications to me that I saw a quality flick were these; I had no feeling of remorse about paying full price to get in  a la any Schumacher Batman, The Avengers, MK: Annihilation, Godzilla, or Armageddon. (wow  how many of those came out this year? Ugh) Also  I look forward to the inevitable sequel  as per the film's ending. Let's just hope they do as good a job with it as with the first one.<br /><br />",positive
"I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the Batman series  Spawn, Judge Dredd, and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs  I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind  why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story, how difficult is that? And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence  blood  martial arts  weapons  fire  the good against evil  etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies  and most of them have bombed. But not Blade  the movie was filmed just right  not going overboard  delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool  but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I've seen in a long time.",positive
"I must confess that I've been a huge fan of the almighty David the Hoff Hasselhoff ever since he starred in the hit 80's TV series Knight Rider. Whether it's his extraordinary debut as a libidinous high school basketball player in the hilariously raunchy Revenge of the Cheerleaders or his brilliant portrayal of a dashing prince in the schlocky sci-fi gem Starcrash, the Hoff has proved time and time again that he's a simply terrific (and shamefully underrated) actor supreme. The Hoff excels here as Gary  a cynical and skeptical photographer who along with his repressed virginal writer girlfriend Leslie (attractive brunette Leslie Cummings) investigates a seedy dilapidated haunted hotel located on a remote island off the coast of Massachussetts. They're doing research on witchcraft throughout the ages and the hotel's last owner was an actress who allegedly practiced the black arts. A bickering family also shows up on the premises to check out the hotel. Pretty soon various folks begin to get bumped off in assorted gruesome ways by the mysterious Lady in Black (an effectively eerie Hildegard Knef).<br /><br />Granted  the rest of the cast gives the Hoff a run for his money: the ever-perky Linda Blair projects her customary charming flair as a spunky pregnant woman who winds up becoming possessed (natch!)  legendary jazz singer Annie Ross bitches it up with gleeful aplomb as a snippy old bat (poor Annie winds up being incinerated alive after she has her lips sewn shut and she's hung upside down in a chimney)  and gorgeous blonde Catherine Hickland oozes considerable sex appeal from every fetching pore as a lusty slut. Fabrizio Laurenti's competent direction  a suitably creepy atmosphere  Gianlorenzo Battaglia's slick  glossy cinematography (the fluid prowling Steadicam tracking shots are especially nice)  the gaudy special effects  Carlo Maria Cordio and Randy Miller's spirited shuddery'n'spooky score  and the gory  sadistic violence are all up to par. But ultimately it's the tremendously dynamic and charismatic presence of the one and only the Hoff which makes this choice tasty chunk of tacky Italian horror cheese such a winner: He takes his shirt off once (hubba hubba!)  gets sprayed with blood  and -- WARNING: Major *SPOILER* ahead -- even meets a pleasingly grisly untimely end. Produced by none other than Joe D'Amato  this picture overall rates as good  sleazy fun.",positive

Witchery is a decent little Euro-Trash horror yarn! David Hasselhoff is pretty damn funny in this one and sadly  he's one of the better actors. Linda Blair is downright terrible and the lady who plays Hoff's wife...she is hilariously bad! The plot of this film is ridiculous too. It's got some holes  which you can't help but notice  but it remains entertaining throughout.<br /><br />The gore in Witchery is freaking outstanding. I loved the part where the old bag gets sucked into the trash chute and ends up in the chimney to roast! And the part where the lady gets taken advantage of by the Devil was pretty damned disturbing. I'd say this one is a must for gorehounds.<br /><br />If you're looking for an overproduced  well-acted flick  look elsewhere. But if you like old-school style Italian sleaze and over the top gore  Witchery belongs on your shelf.<br /><br />I'm surprised by the low rating on here! What were you people expecting  The Exorcist? 7 out of 10  kids.,positive
Linda Blair has been acting for forty years now  and while she will never escape the part of Regan MacNeil in The Exorcist  few of her subsequent horror films have used her legendary status to such great effect as Witchery does. She plays Jane Brooks  a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to an abandoned island hotel that her parents want to purchase. They are accompanied by a couple of real estate agents (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth) and upon arriving at the island they meet a photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming) who are illegally squatting in the hotel while investigating the legend of a local witch (Hildegard Knef). It seems that a long-ago witch-hunt resulted in her suicide  and she was with child at the time. Unaware of the danger  Jane has recently dreamt of the witch's dramatic death  and Jane's little brother Tommy (Michael Manchester) has been more directly visited by her spooky  black-clad spirit  which he calls 'the lady in black'. The group's time at the island inn begins quietly enough; unknown to them  however  the Lady in Black has already dispatched the captain of their hired boat (George Stevens). Before long  the isolation and cold begin to affect everyone  and it is during this period of moodiness and tension that the Lady in Black begins her reign of terror. She plans to avenge her own fate by possessing Jane and sacrificing her companions and her unborn child. Each of her other victims fulfills an aspect of her vengeful curse - greed  lust  and the blood of a virgin. As the sun goes down and the sea becomes wild  she haunts them one by one in gruesome  horrifying ways. The island location is effectively scary  and the inn is very creepy and hauntingly shot. It's such a colorful film that it reminds me of Dario Argento's work. The lighting is excellent  and the set decoration is perfectly spooky. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The horror effects are extreme  terrifying  and unforgettable. The cinematography is great  and it is this that brings us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this film shoots her like a horror star should be shot: lots of dramatic push-ins  lingering close-ups that subtly detail Jane's incremental possession  and moments that are reminiscent of other great horror films. There are hidden homages to Rosemary's Baby  Jacob's Ladder  The Shining  Black Sunday  and of course The Exorcist. She does a great job  and absolutely steals the show with her moody and understated performance. That isn't to say that the rest of the cast disappoints; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good  and veteran performer Annie Ross is memorable as Jane's bitchy mother Rose. Hasselhoff gives it his best  but he is not essentially a film star  and his television persona gets in the way of his performance. Blair and young Michael Manchester have a wonderful chemistry together. The film is otherwise so violent and creepy (in a good way) that it desperately needs their warmth (Blair also played a mother in 2003's Monster Makers  and her maternal scenes in that film have the same tender feeling to them). Lastly  Hildegard Knef (in one of her last roles) plays a great witch  and she has the most amazing voice and accent. Along with Blair  she was also perfectly cast. But it's Blair's movie all the way. Jane Brooks also seems to have some psychic ability  and this aspect of the film hearkens back to Exorcist II: The Heretic. I think Witchery is up there with The Exorcist  Exorcist II  Hell Night  and Summer of Fear as Blair's best genre work to date.,positive
This is a must-see movie. You will laugh  you will cry  and when it's over you'll wish there were more. Well-written and compelling  this movie draws you in and holds on tight. The casting was perfect  the characters purposeful  and the performances outstanding. Nanny is the standard to which all women should hold themselves: strong  forgiving  protective  and never judgmental. Nanny  to me  is the epitome of what a Christian mother and woman should be: a true pillar of the community. If I were half the woman Nanny is  I might consider myself to be doing okay. I would have been devastated if Nanny had died at some point in the movie  but since she didn't I will definitely buy this when it comes out on DVD. I can only hope that the story continues and that Ruben goes back to Lackawanna to try to rebuild the town  piece by piece and person by person.,positive
Witchery  or Witchcraft as it's commonly known in Europe  beings with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) waking up from a nightmare involving a witch. Jane's Mother & Father Rose (Annie Ross) & Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old deserted hotel on an island about 50 miles from Boston  renovating it & reopening it. Together with Jane & their young son Tommy (Michael Manchester) Rose & Freddie are planning to travel to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to check on the amount of work that needs doing  they also meet up with the estate agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) & hire a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island. Once there they enter the hotel & begin to inspect the property while back on the boat Sam is killed & the boat is let loose to sail off into the distance. They discover two unexpected guests in the shape of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) & his virgin fiancé Leslie (Leslie Cumming) who happens to be researching a book that she is writing about the gruesome legends & superstitions surrounding the infamous island & hotel. As the night draws on a raging storm outside isolates them from the mainland as a mysterious 'lady in black' (Hildegard Knef) keeps popping up as the ancient evil that resides in the hotel seeks fresh victims for demonic possession  human sacrifice & Satanic rites...<br /><br />The director of this American Italian co-produced film is somewhat shrouded in mystery as the IMDb lists Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin but there are rumours that Joe D'Amato did the honours  either way to be honest despite it's bad reputation I found Witchery quite entertaining in a so-bad-it's-good cheesy sort of way. The script credited to Harry Spalding & Daniele Stroppa on the IMDb again is confusing too as the actual credit on the film itself is Daniel Davis  anyway whoever wrote this thing did a decent job  please stop laughing. At heart it's a haunted house horror but adds some gory deaths & a surreal feeling to everything. The different sets of characters have reasonable motives & didn't get on my nerves as much as I'd thought they might  it's not plotted very well  it doesn't make a whole a lot of sense & the dialogue isn't exactly top drawer stuff but as a whole Witchery entertained me for it's 95 odd minute duration plain & simple. It's reasonably well paced  a little slow to get going maybe but there are plenty of surreal  bizarre goings-on & gruesome deaths to keep one amused. One part of Witchery which destroys some of it's credibility is this so-called storm  there is no storm in sight & the sea is probably calm enough to swim in  Witchery's supposed 'twist' ending didn't really work for me either & just check out the dumb expression on Cummings face on that final freeze-frame. The hotel provides for a good isolated location & adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the distinctive indefinable 'horror' feel throughout  cheap horror at that. Technically Witchery is not too bad at all  it was obviously shot on location so it looks good throughout & while not exactly the pinnacle of film-making finesse it's overall production values are slightly better than expected. The violence & gore is of typical Euro explicitness  a woman has her lips sewn shut & hung inside a fireplace so she can't scream as the others light it  someone is crucified & then burned alive  impaled on a swordfish  someones veins expand & pop & a woman is raped by a man with no lips. Witchery was shot in English so there is no dubbing  as far as acting goes David Hasselhoff & Linda Blair in the same film what more can I say?! Yes ladies Hasselhoff does take his shirt off & for the lads Cummings takes hers off. Both Hasselhoff & Blair are a hoot to watch in this thing  however the little kid is very annoying & really can't act at all. I sure most sane film-goers will disagree with my opinions but I still stand by the fact that I liked it & would happily watch it again  Witchery is pretty good fun & definitely worth a watch if your into 'bad' films or your a horror fan in general.,positive
I like seeing Linda Blair playing in an actual horror movie again. I had been disappointed with her in most everything since the Exorcist movies (Which i loved). What was up with all of those nasty B-movies she did? <br /><br />David Hassellhoff on the other hand  all i could do is laugh. He is not cut out to be a horror movie actor. David needs to stick to Knight Rider or Baywatch.<br /><br />All around  this is an awesome movie. Even for the eighties  this was an awesome film. It has horror  action  and drama. It is a suspenseful  and I loved the way Linda Blair turned out.,positive
During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it. Something like: Is Killinggänget now taking off Nazism?<br /><br />So  my comprehension of this movie  was from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism. When recently seeing this movie in the TV-version I had this filter before me and it wasn't difficult to see this.<br /><br />Strangely enough I haven't met this way of interpreting the film ever since I first heard it.<br /><br />These are the things I found in Four shades of brown. In all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster:<br /><br />1. The crematory-worker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them. In the crematory-room in dealing with death and fire it's almost like a cheerful game to him. The seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boy accordingly  in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that injures his father severely.<br /><br />Possible lesson: The importance of showing the young adequate emotions. When they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good.<br /><br />2.The magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer. Just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand  reaching for personality  integrity and joy  he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despair.<br /><br />Their son has tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and good taste in opposite to his parents bad taste. The real problem he is carrying within is far from comprehensible to him: His fathers behavior passes on when suffocating his own wife in his spotless environment.<br /><br />Possible lesson: Oppression breeds bondage.<br /><br />3.The father who was abused as a child passes on sadism to his children when he cheats them on their inheritance. He robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritance.<br /><br />Possible lesson: When no love given you cannot give any.<br /><br />4.The fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a ruthless revenger with sadistic aggression. Here the ice cold Nazi-sadism becomes very obvious in physical violence. It gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young scin-head-nazists behavior when oppressing others. <br /><br />Possible lesson? : Can Nazism take birth in a pervert home?<br /><br />Can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life  in the long run  be that room is given to sadistic Nazism ?<br /><br />Very seldom does a movie contains so much. It reveals little by little as I meditate on it. I consider it brilliantly painted and the actors are superb. Especially the nice-seeming bloke played by Ulf Brunnberg that turns out to be the worst of all..,positive
This movie must be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece  with a both bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. The one with the newly renovated hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four  odd story about love or career. I would love to see all four as a film on their own they can be so much more extended. <br /><br />Also the unique pause in the middle is something I've never seen before.<br /><br />Can't wait for the series (if they're doing one) or the extended DVD. Apparently they had cut out a lot to fit it in to just 3 5 hours.,positive
I didn't know what to expect from this hugely popular (and hilarious) Swedish comedy & satire team  as they released their first feature film. More broad satire? Well  we do get four contemporary  exceptionally memorable tales of family pains  generation gaps and fatherhood  in particular. But it's drama  thankfully  and what drama! Epic in its scope  as each episode is from carefully picked  geographically different parts of Sweden. But each story could seriously carry a whole movie  if expanded separately.<br /><br />It's dark  twisted  harrowing  yet massively entertaining and breathtakingly executed. Script  acting and cinematography are absolute world class  as three hours seem to get by in a blink! It's four shades of mastery  and easily one of the best films in the nations' cinema history. It's Sweden's answer to Short cuts or Magnolia  if you like  and instantly on par with those!<br /><br />9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe,positive
Never  ever  have I been as impressed by a film as this little piece about four groups of people  that faces a crisis  or many. In some ways a little like Short Cuts  but totally different  at the same time.<br /><br />There are a heap of lead characters  whom we all learn to know very well as their stories unfold  and they are  as persons show their good and their bad sides  their weaknesses and their strengths  with lots of drama and laughter.<br /><br />The closest equivalent in a US movie  I can think of  which then is far weaker in every respect  is the Royal Tenenbaums. <br /><br />Four Shades of Brown  as the title would be in English  tells the story about a stressed out hotelier and his wife  and his elderly parents (who are traveling magicians); about the receptionist at an animal crematory and his family misadventures; about the members of a cooking course (who mostly talk about their sorry lives) and fourthly about the funeral for a womanizing trotter jockey  who tries to continue orchestrating the family from beyond the grave  by singing and appearing in 3D during the funeral  thanks to high tech equipment that has cost his entire fortune (the family gets nil  not even the famous horse is given to the family)!<br /><br />There is a warmth and compassion in this film  that is filled with grief and laughter  that I've never experienced before.<br /><br />Most actors were new to me  except Robert Gustafsson and one or two more  but they all deserve the big slam the film took at the Swedish Guldbagge extravaganza (= the Swedish Oscar Awards) a week ago!<br /><br />Male  female and male supporting actor prizes went to this film  plus a few more  to boot!<br /><br />If you have the chance  go and see it - the hours float by very quickly!,positive
This movie is about London and it's an amazing movie. it will be released on DVD in april 2003 and I will buy it when it gets out so If you have not seen it until then BUY IT. The music in the movie is even better (saint etienne) have done the soundtrack.,positive
Being a fan of Saint Etienne and the City of London  I was very excited to see this movie on the list of the Vancouver International Film Festival. This movie has great shots  an absolutely excellent soundtrack and interesting insights into a 'not so well known' London.<br /><br />The movie is held completely in 'dark' colours  which I personally don't like too much. Furthermore the narration was a little too British and the comments sometimes got a little flat. Other than that  there are some great comments by Londoners and excellent shots. FINISTERRE doesn't glorify London by showing all the great attractions of the city  but rather gives deep insights in what London is really like. From the East end to the vibrant centre with its music scene as well as the 'special little retreats' for Londoners.<br /><br />All in all:<br /><br />+Great Soundtrack +Nice shots +great insights<br /><br />-Narration -Tiering to watch at times -Very dark picture<br /><br />Worth watching! I give it a 7/10,positive
I absolutely LOVED this movie! Since I don't want to give much away  it's basically about about a mother and a daughter and the life they have together. It's very heartwarming story  between the struggles they have. I also think Natalie and Susan have perfect chemistry throughout the entire film! This is definitely worth seeing! Two thumbs up  way up!,positive
I just saw this movie tonight. Coming into it I thought it would be good because I like Natalie Portman alot and Susan Sarandon is a great actor too  but it was way better than I could have imagined. You come out of the movie feeling great. The acting was excellent  which is something that can be hard to come by lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and me being a college student at NYU  think that it is great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor. Anyways  back on subject  the movie keeps you interested the entire way through and I definitely think that everyone should go see it. I would give more details  but I don't want to give away the movie.,positive
I just came back from seeing this awesome movie!! I can relate to it so much...It reminded me when my sister had to go to college  we had to move from place to place  and my mom acts like Adele August! Boys might not like this movie since it brings tears to your eyes. One of the best real-life movies I've ever seen!! and Natalie Portman rules!! 10/10,positive
"I'm sorry  but Star Wars Episode 1 did not do any justice to Natalie Portman's talent (and undeniable cuteness). She was entirely underused as Queen Amidala  and when she was used  her makeup was frighteningly terrible. For Anywhere But Here, she sheds her god-awful makeup and she acts normally. And not only can she act good  she looks good doing it. I'm a bit older than she (she's only 18)  and I have little or no chance of meeting her  but hey  a guy is allowed to dream  right?<br /><br />Even though Susan Sarandon does take a good turn in this movie  the film belongs entirely to Portman. I've been a watcher of Portman's since Beautiful Girls (where she was younger  but just as cute). There's big things for her in the future - I can see it.",positive
Adam Sandler's movies are my favorite comedies. The Silence of the Lambs is my favorite horror movie. The Matrix is my favorite sci-fi movie. Anywhere But Here is my favorite drama.<br /><br />Perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it's acting.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon is absolutely amazing. By the end of this movie I felt as if I knew her character better than I knew myself. She did a simply amazing job.<br /><br />Natalie Portman also did a great job. I recently rented her first movie  Leon (1994)  in which she played a 12 year old girl. I believe that she is a contradiction in terms; she was a good kid actress. Well  5 years later she is still just as good an actress. In fact  she's much better.<br /><br />Not only did Sarandon and Portman portray their characters well  but they also worked perfectly together. I mean  even now I can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie.<br /><br />This movie is about a 14 year old girl (Portman) and her restless mother (Sarandon) that leave their home town in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills.<br /><br />At first Portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends  and the two begin a very tumultuous relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years (usually down  might I add).<br /><br />Although this explanation is a little vague  the plot can only be summarized vaguely. But when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak  for it is actually very deep. What I am saying is that the plot is outlined weakly  but then they focus in on it to make it strong.<br /><br />And it is very strong  but also the plot sequencing is great. And there are a few brilliant scenes that I hope will someday be seen as classic.<br /><br />I loved this movie. I laughed. I cried. And although  admittedly  there are a few loopholes  it's still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end.,positive
Being 15 myself I enjoyed this flick thouroughly!! I related to the character Ann August more than most would. My Mother isnt AS eccentric as Adele  but the feelings of lonliness is the same. This movie is perfect in the ating aspects  and Natalie's  and Susan's performances are so linked together that it's the best onscreen dual i have seen in years. Their chemistry brings the characters to life  they become real people! I would recommend this flick to anyone who is hoping to get away. Because there is genually alot of people out there who would wish to be Anywhere But Here including me! and if you can  see this movie with your best friend or your mother. Its the tears that blend everyone around you together more!!,positive
Its the best movie I have seen in 2000  it has the beautiful and talented Natalie Portman in it. It has a great storyline  cast and soundtrack. I enjoyed it very much. 10 out of 10,positive
Since I am a fan of Natalie Portman  I had to see the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. It plays out in a very sincere way. Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if Natalie was the mother and Susan was the mother. Susan's character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of it.<br /><br />I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Natalie and some-guy (he's in Outside Providence) but Natalie would only accept the script if that scene was removed. And I think that is great. I think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the film.<br /><br />Natalie must have a knack for picking good movies to be in because I haven't seen her in a bad film yet. So  any movie that has Natalie Portman will no doubt be seen by me.<br /><br />A good film. 7/10,positive
Most families will recognise similarities between their own family and that created through brilliant acting by Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Natalie creates an on screen image that justifies her as one of the best actresses in America and one worthy of a Golden Globe Nomination. The control of her emotions are so in tact that at any point in the movie she can tap into them and release an unforgettable scene. Susan is also amazing in this movie as yet again she chose a role that is so different to any other and carries it through with true professionalism.<br /><br />Any Natalie fan would've seen the film based on her past successes  but you should also see it for the emotions that are released during the film. It is a truly humbling experience.,positive
This movie was very good  not great but very good. It is based on a one man play by Ruben Santiago Hudson..yes he played most of the parts. On paper it looks like stunt casting. Yes let's round up all the black folks in Hollywood and put them in one movie. Halle Berry even produced it. The only name I didn't see was Oprah's  thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a Hallmark movie. Instead this movie was not some sentimental mess. It was moving but not phony  the characters came and went with the exception of her husband  Pauline and the writer in question. The movie revolved around the universe of Nanny  Mrs Bill Crosby and how she raised the writer and took in people. Now being a jaded New Yorker when he said she took in sick people and old and then we see them going to a mental institution to pick up a man  I'm thinking looks like sister has a medicare scam going. Getting folks jobs and taking the medicare/caid checks But no she explains to Lou Gosset she just wants 25 bucks a week and did not want the money ahead of time. I think that part was put in the movie just for us jaded New Yorkers so we know she is not scamming the poor folks.(g) It was written by a New Yorker so he knows the deal(g).. She almost seems angelic and looking through a little boys eyes I can see why. She is married to a ne'er do well who is 17 years younger and fools around on her. Terrence Howard was born to play these type of parts. He was good but I would like to see him play something different. Markerson who plays Nanny is also very good. But for some reason the person who stood out to me was a small role played by Jeffery Wright. Where is this mans Oscar? He already won a Emmy and a Tony. He was in Shaft and he stole the movie. I did not even know who he was in this movie. He is a chameleon never the same. I never seen him play a bad part yet. This was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and cry. I re-winded the scene few times ..one time because I didn't know who he was. His wife Carman Ejogo was excellent. I have seen her in roles before mostly mousy stuff. But she is so good here. I actually know people who act just like her. So it was very real to me Macy Grey who had one of the bigger parts was also very good. I was very happy that they did not kill Nanny off. I thought she was a goner in the beginning of the movie. BUT she was able to go home and start her old routine of taking care of people. There are women like that in most of our lives. People we might know or even lived with. Thank god for them  I do not know how they do it all of the time. I have a friend who lost 2 children and been through a lot of stuff but whenever I am feeling selfishly sorry for myself I call her and she always puts me in a good mood. THis movie is a tribute to all of those people. I only wish they they told us what happened to some of the characters like the the one armed man  Paulines boyfriend who is played by one of my favorite actors on HBO's The Wire  Omar  Rosie Perez's character and Richard the lesbian and Delroy Lindo's one arm man  he was mesmerizing in another small role.,positive
Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I've never appreciated her acting more than as I did in this movie. She really acted as though she were Adele August. I can appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual persona and create a character who's truly believable. <br /><br />Natalie Portman as Ann August helped create the ideal antagonist as their characters developed through the movie. The movie was about them so the other characters were peripheral.<br /><br />I gave this movie an eight rating  but Susan received a ten from me because of her performance. As far as relationship movies go  Beaches and Terms of Endearment had a greater impact on me than this movie  but I highly recommend it.,positive
it´s a movie to see on tv and only once.. i mean  it´s good  but it´s a little too lengthy and the plot is so well-known  it isn´t very original but it isn´t boring. the best thing of the movie are the performances  natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actress and in this movie they have done a great job. i give it a 7.,positive
I was laying in bed  flicking through the channels... and boy do I have channels... 500 of them. With over 70 movie channels  I probably watch a movie on cable  once or twice a month... DVD has spolied me.<br /><br />Anyway  I'm flicking through and I come to this movie and because I see Natilie Portman  I take interest. 110 minutes later I am still interested. How could this be? When I first saw the previews to this movie in the theater I remember making fun of it. I never thought I'd watch it... nevermind like it.<br /><br />The story is based on a book  and you can tell. The movie is very episodic  andit's not like the movie has a great plot  it just sucks you in. May-be its that performances that do it. I'm pretty sure in must have been.<br /><br />This movie was good for no reason...<br /><br />Peter's Movie Rating (out of 10): 7,positive
This was a great movie. Something not only for Black History month but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it truly does take a village to raise a child. The performances by S Eptath was outstanding. Mos Def and his singing was off the hook. Had to do a double take when I saw that was Rosie Perez there. But the supporting cast of actors and actresses made this worth watching. All the different stories they had was amazing. And how Nanny protected Jr and literally everyone else that was in her presence. I can truly understand her being the matriarch of that time period and even more so how tired she was in helping everyone. Cant wait for it to come out on DVD. It would be a welcome addition to any movie library.,positive
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the part of a flighty  irrational and possessive mother  who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is dubious  but at first she has no choice--- the bond with mother is pathologically strong.<br /><br />In time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground. She sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome  seductive guy who loves 'em and leaves 'em. She sees that the mother doesn't get it. So how can she look to her mother for guidance?<br /><br />The mother directs the girl to a drama try-out and sees the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly-by-night mother. This causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is apologetic  but the lesson takes hold.<br /><br />There is character-growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually is persuaded to let the girl go. It is a touching scene and a valuable lesson  that parents  however emotionally dependent  have to let the child go and become her own separate person.,positive
Anywhere But Here is not exactly anything new  but the excellent performances by both of the main actresses made it worth watching. Sarandon and Portman are a mother and daughter who move from rural Wisconsin to sunny Beverly Hills  California  in search of a better life. The main conflict comes from the fact that Natalie would much rather have stayed in Wisconsin with all of her friends and family  and she felt that she was forced to go to California with her overbearing mother. <br /><br />(spoilers) While it's true that the film as a whole is disappointingly predictable  Susan Sarandon and especially Natalie Portman give performances that are so good that they almost make the material seem new. Anywhere But Here doesn't cover any new ground  but it does have the rare quality of being able to take overused subject matter and make it fairly interesting again. Also seen in this movie is the most heartbreaking facial expression seen in years  seen on Natalie Portman's face when her mother drops her off on the side of the road and she watches the car fade into the distance. Particularly noteworthy is the ironic subplot about Natalie's mother pressing her to become an actress  as well as a very convincing performance from Shawn Hatosy as one of Natalie's very close cousins from back home. His death is a tragic cliché almost always seen in movies like this one  but the rest of the film makes up for numerous weaknesses like this. Not great  but Anywhere But Here is definitely worth a look.,positive
Chick Flick? Of course.... Been done before? Many times.... Predictable? Yes..... Worth watching? You bet! I was delighted with Sarandon and Portman's portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line. I am a great fan of mother/daughter stories. What makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones ARE the performances and the character development. Although this is not the BEST of its genre  I will buy it and watch it again. I felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior.,positive
Regarded as another one of the recent over-the-top drama's brought upon us by Hollywood  this movie excels where others have totally failed(especially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of Natalie Portman)  this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both Susan and Natalie share. They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family. They go through so many mother-daughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities. I feel that these two actress' talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar (full of cliche's) and really saved the suffering plot. I would recommend this movie mainly to those who like either of the two actresses or such over-the-top drama's.,positive
I thought Anywhere But Here was a good movie.It stars two wonderful actresses  Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman  which when I heard they were in a movie together I resist watching it.Overall  it was a pretty enjoyable movie.It had it's moments where I felt as if they tried to hard  and there was also some really overdone and worn-out material  but there wasn't anything in the movie that I absolutely hated.I even liked how they used the pop-up performance of the uncredited Thora Birch  and all the little happy/sad moments are touching and effective.If you want to watch this movie  go ahead  because even though I don't recommend it  it's not something you should avoid  and a 5.9 rating seems unfair in my opinion.,positive
This film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible  and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils.<br /><br />Anywhere But Here is an engaging film from beginning to the end. Both Ann and Adele are described well right at the start  so we get to know how different their personalities are. Clashes inevitably ensue  and they are engagingly presented. I find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances. it is as if I am living their lives  feeling what they are feeling.<br /><br />Susan Sarandon gives another excellent performance in Anywhere But Here. She is charismatic  happy go lucky  hedonistic  warm and loving all at once. I have always liked Susan Sarandon  and I think she is grossly underrated.<br /><br />Anywhere But Here is a captivating emotional journey.,positive
The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman. She gave her rather thankless character a lot of much-appreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon  a fine actress  is suitably sincere as the mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable  a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script. I am not saying the script was bad in any way  I am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times. I don't think it was the script writer's fault. The film did suffer from being overlong  and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes. The film does look beautiful  with some good direction and excellent performances. All in all  watchable certainly  but maybe more for an older audience. 7/10 Bethany Cox.,positive
Anne (Natalie Portman) tells us about how much she hates her mother  Adele (Susane Sarandon). That's how the movie begins. Adele decided that her and her daughter were moving to California without asking anyone and leaving her husband without any reason. The story is about the relationship between the mother and the daughter. It's really deep and touching  thanks to the great work of the actresses. Natalie was nominated to a Golden Globe for that role. She is one of the most talented actresses I ever saw  and so is Sarandon. They really look like mother daughter. The soundtrack is also great. The movie is incredible. *10 out of 10*,positive
I was able to see Anywhere But Here last night as a free sneak preview. I absolutely LOVED the film! I was drawn to it because of the realistic portrayal of a mother/daughter relationship...there was definitely a connection between Adele a and Ann. I think that speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of both Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was just the right actress to portray Adele and after leaving the theater I could not think of another actress in the role. Portman was also excellent as Ann. She brought a sense of maturity and intelligence to the role that I don't think any other teenage actress could. I think it would the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give credit where it is due and nominate both Sarandon and Portman for Awards in the Actress and Supporting Actress categories. It would be a shame if they were overlooked.,positive
My one-line summary hints that this is not a good film  but this is not true. I did enjoy the movie  but was probably expecting too much.<br /><br />Adele  who is solidly portrayed by Susan Sarandon  did not come off as a very likable character. She is flighty and irresponsible to what would be an unforgivable degree were it not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. This is the one thing she knows how to do without fail. Adele's daughter  Anna  is a sad girl who is so busy making up for her mother's shortcomings that she does not seem to be only 14-17 years old. This  of course  makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna since she never seems to be 14- 17 years old either. Portman pulls this role off with such ease that you almost forget that she has not been making movies for 20 years. Yet  even with the two solid leads  Wayne Wang never seems to quite draw the audience in as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and even more so with Smoke. Though I have not read the book  the film feels as if it has made necessary changes to the story to bring it to the big screen  changes which may drain the emotional pungency of the story. I enjoyed the film for the fun of watching two wonderful actresses do their work  but I never got lost in the experience and I never related to their plight.,positive
No blood  no sex (though it oozes passion)  no special effects  but just one of those pearls that comes across your movie screen when you're not really looking and grabs your attention. <br /><br />Great acting  great sets  great music  beautiful storyline. If only there were a lot more movies made like this one!<br /><br />The sets move us through time and make us feel like we were there.<br /><br />The acting appears like real life  and elevates us to the level of awareness of Nanny  to whom no-one is a lost cause  least of all the inhabitants of her own Halfway house. <br /><br />Best of all it's a true story of misfits learning to fit in. I was somewhat jealous of the good times that everyone appeared to be having in the movie! Could we all spend some time in Nanny's house?,positive
Natile Portman and Susan Sarandon play off of each other like a symphony in this coming of age story about a young girl  who is sentenced to life as the daughter of one of the nuttest women you will ever encounter. Sarandon has this ability  call it talent if you will  to play some of the most off-beat characters and bring their humanity to forefront of any film she makes. As the mother of this obviously brilliant and muture beyond her years young girl  Sarandon alternates between being the mom and being the child with the ease of a ballet dancer. More importantly she does it with strength and flare without stomping all over Portman's portrayal of the daughter. The question is always asked when we deconstruct the film plot  who changes? This film is certainly about the daughter  but if you look close at the dreams and sacrifices that Mom makes you come to understand that she changes in step with her daughter. I am willing to bet this makes all of us in the audience change also. The hallmark of fine drama,positive
Being a freshman in college  this movie reminded me of my relationship with my mom. Of course  my situation doesn't parrallel with Natalie Portman and Surandon's situation; but my mom and I have grown up with the typical mother and daughter fights. There is always the mother telling you what to do  or not being the kind of mother you want to be. I was balling my eyes at the end of this movie. Surandon's reaction of her daughter going to the East coast  miles away  after all they've been through reminded me of how I felt  being from a small city in the West coast  going to New York. <br /><br />The movie is meant for women who have children that are now all grown up. It is very touching  I was moved by the movie. Every feeling out of the characters in this movie was utterly real  you didn't get any phony sentimentality. I was sitting through the credits at the screening of this movie  alone  wishing my mother was sitting next to me so I could hug her and thank her for everything. This movie is a bit corny of course  but everything is trully momentous. Its all about what a mom can learn from her child; and what a child learns from her mother. 8/10,positive
The interaction between Portman and Sarandon was quite interesting  and I was really sold on the mother-daughter relationship. It is a family story that isn't dulled down by frills and special effects; a story of how it really is. I couldn't help but give of a sigh at the end of this movie for alas it is a well told bittersweet tale of growing up and relating with family and friends. The acting was quite exquisite and I hope we'll be seeing both Portman and Sarandon in familiar roles down the road...,positive
Well  I have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film. Natalie Portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother-daughter relationship film. <br /><br />Beautiful film.,positive
This film was a new direction for Natalie Portman. A much more adult role  though she comes to it from the traces of a child in the movie itself. Ann (Portman) and Susan Sarandon  who plays her newly divorced mother  Adele  travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to Beverly Hills. There these tortured souls try to come to terms with their new life and their new relationship as Portman's character grows up. Unknowingly at first to Adele  she grows up and becomes a better mother for it.<br /><br />Ann sees her mother telling her she wants to be an actress  or so she thinks. Adele uses that crutch every time there are problems in their lives. We see their struggle as mother and daughter come to terms between themselves and with being alone  having left their old lives behind.<br /><br />The acting is top notch from both of them. They seemingly become mother and daughter before your eyes. You can almost feel there is a bond there beyond the actual movie.<br /><br />Though this movie really doesn't take us to any new ground in these types of films  the fact that the acting is well done  and the story isn't too flawed  let's me recommend it.<br /><br />I will say however  it will probably go away soon  I don't believe it can have the staying power needed for a huge Christmas season of movies starting in a week or so. See it now before this happens if you like either of these actresses.,positive
Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August  a single mother who's the working definition of the word dreamer and her solemn  pragmatic daughter. Adele  wanting to make a fresh start in a big city  moves them from Wisconsin to California.<br /><br />Decent  if not exceptional or particularly memorable  with some serious and sad moments. It pushes some emotional buttons  that's for sure. Best thing it offers is a solid cast  and Sarandon and Portman are quite good in the leads - even if their characters are one-dimensional at times.<br /><br />Could be better  could be worse.<br /><br />I gave this one seven out of ten.,positive
Wayne Wang's direction may be the ingredient which made this film much more impressive to me than Slums of Beverly Hills  which covers remarkably similar ground. The interplay between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is riveting. Real chemistry there. This film succeeded in bringing me inside the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me down into depressed frustration. Susan Sarandon's character hammers at all the nerves which a narcissistic parent is capable of touching in an insecure adolescent. She amazingly manages to do this without coming across as floridly insane or intentionally sadistic. And  Natalie Portman deflects each attack on her character's ego with the resigned grace of an intelligent codependent child  untainted by the smug cynicism of the Natasha Lyonne character in Slums of Beverly Hills. Portman's character is an adolescent with dignity under stress  an unusual creature in modern films. The film reaches a very satisfying resolution without trying too hard. I highly recommend this film to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.,positive
A MUST SEE documentary.-----This movie had so many things to consider while watching it. It was a great documentary of a trial of a 15 year old black kid named Brenton Butler. He accused of killing a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements from the husband of the dead woman of the description of the man that killed his wife. The husband seemed to want to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. The police little to investigate the crime. Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness is meticulous in getting information to help his client. He tells the viewers what he thinks and the strategy he will use on the police to show their incomplete investigation and beatings against his young client to get him to confess. The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was questioned. McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how the audio is monitored. He questions a policeman on the stand and ask what the heard Brenton say to one of the investigators and he challenges their own words. McGuinness investigates with Ann Finnell each place the police should have gone and the things they should have done but did not. The movie shows the Butlers as a loving Christian family who have faith in their son's innocence and faith that God will set Brenton free. They visit him in jail and pray with him there to encourage him. There are scenes of group prayer for Brenton  the lawyers  the Judge and everyone involved in this case. I am a white and I was surprised to see how blacks in high police positions treat other blacks. It was very disappointing to see black and white police stick together when they think they got their man. Police have a hard job and I believe most of them are honorable not like the ones in this movie. I think this is a great movie for anyone involved in the Judicial system including Judges  police and lawyers and even potential jurors to watch this movie and learn from it.,positive
I saw this movie last night on HBO & didn't expect to get hooked - I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But it happened & you will too. It's a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in Jacksonville  Florida and subsequent investigation  arrest  & trial of a 15 year old boy.<br /><br />Watch this movie today & get a feel for how we have progressed as a society. This film was most deserving of an esteemed Oscar - you'll be moved to tears.,positive
This is an extraordinary film. As a courtroom drama  it's compelling  as an indictment on the American justice system  it's frightening. For Brenton Butler the consequences of this system could be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process  that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence  but rather  is about who presents better in court. In truth  the implications of this case reach beyond the possibility of an innocent man being found guilty  or a guilty man being free. Every citizen has a right to justice  whether a perpetrator or a victim. But do they get it? The film is well paced  understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.,positive
Art imitates life imitates art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated into the D.A. in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a who-done-it and how did it happen. The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers. Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic  integrity  and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again. The music is driving but not obtrusive; the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience.,positive
Anyone that is looking for an episode of Law and Order or CSI would have to look elsewhere as the most basic elements of police or forensics work were totally ignored in this case.<br /><br />A murder took place  and all the police did was to grab a 15-year-old boy off the street and take him to the only witness - a 65-year-old man - and say is this the guy who did it? Sure  the old man thought that the kid in the back of the police car had to be guilty. never mind that he looked nothing like the real killer and was dressed completely differently. He must have shrunk  reversed his age by 5-10 years and changed clothes.<br /><br />The police made absolutely no effort - and they admitted it! The did no forensics on any of the evidence  they questioned no other witnesses  and they beat a confession out of a 15-year-old.<br /><br />The saddest thing about this compelling look at the criminal justice system is that it occurred right down the road in Jacksonville  Florida. Let everyone now start talking about Southern justice.,positive
Very good film. Very good documentary.<br /><br />Very good to see those vermin detectives humiliated and found out as the bigoted  narcissistic  heartless swines their one eyed parents  community and environment raised them as.<br /><br />I tip my lid to Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent human being on some kind of 911 commission or investigation? We need his integrity  endurance  intelligence  clarity and spirit fighting the rigged game that is world politics and big business.<br /><br />All the animals come out at night - whores  skunk pussies  buggers  queens  fairies  dopers  junkies  sick  venal. Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. Pat McGuinness should be the first drops of that real rain. The people who control this earth are animals. They need to be drowned.<br /><br />I'm just in shock. Walking the night is scary business. The inhuman howling and cackling is of detectives  in Murder On A Sunday Morning. In Pat McGuinness' blazing spotlight  they look horribly caught  horribly guilty  and ready for a just and horrible drowning.<br /><br />It is exceptionally satisfying  in a world in which the punters play a rigged game  to see justice done and to see every narcissistic felon drown like the pathetic human rats they are.<br /><br />How does it feel you railroading  abominable  snaky fingers of the law? How does it feel to have your rigged prosecution  your rigged confession  your rigged detective work found out for what it really was? How does it feel? <br /><br />I hope it twists like a knife you miserable  one eyed nothings.,positive
"You think the police are always right.<br /><br />You believe that eye-witnesses are always right.<br /><br />You believe the prosecutors will not take a case to court if lazy police have failed to perform 98% of a basic investigation.<br /><br />You believe a U.S. city might have a few bad apples in law enforcement  but that the good cops will quickly nip those who systematically engage in evil-for-evil's sake in the bud.<br /><br />You believe that the possibility of an ex-football lineman being instated as a detective solely because his dad is the county sheriff  and being allowed to beat confessions out of randomly-selected teenagers with absolutely no fear of negative consequences to himself could happen in the America of the 1930s  but not today.<br /><br />You believe a judge will NOT send a case to the jury if anyone with a brain in their head can see the defendant is a totally random passer-by nabbed by the police because it was hot  and they did not feel like working that day.<br /><br />You believe that all the innocent people imprisoned six months here or 20 years there are exceptions to the rule, and an injustice like this could NEVER involve your family member  someone in the middle class  or someone like YOU.<br /><br />You think that you are aware of every terrible  indisputable  100% proved outrage of the last 10 years in America--yet you haven't seen this film.",positive
I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier. It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas.<br /><br />The story is of a 15-year-old black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville  FL  murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced.<br /><br />About half the footage is of the trial; it's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers (two public defenders) explaining their case  interviewing witnesses  and visiting key locations. This is edited with a minimum of needless repetition  and placed in logical order. The camera work is pretty solid. And there's a mildly surprising epilogue.,positive
with that  carry the same dark weaknesses we all unfortunately possess: lying  deception  laziness  the list goes on.<br /><br />However  as an American  I was shocked to see that corruption and racism exist in today's police force as is reflected with the Duval County Sheriff Department's horrible detective and police work with the murder of a white female tourist and a 15-year old accused black youth. I shook my head in shame that detectives were protected from their abusive work while a young man's LIFE hung in the crooked balance of justice.<br /><br />However  there is also a story of hope with our judicial system and how poorly-paid public defenders stuck by their guns (irony intended) and forced the truth from the detectives. I wanted to fly down to Florida and tell anybody with influence what a great public defender team they have in Duval County; those lawyers care about the little man and  most importantly  for justice.<br /><br />The other story line is about faith and family. Praises to the accused's family and their strong Christian (submit any dedicated religion) beliefs and wonderful family values. I hope they win their lawsuit against the Duval County Sheriff's Department.<br /><br />Bravo for justice!!! Bravo for the little guy!!!,positive
I watched this movie with my mother. She is 81 yrs.old and was raised to be a bigot. She even acknowledges this. I don't think she really understood what was happening  she had already made up her mind that the kid was guilty. Scary. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. That is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their ineptitude. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case. It was very fortunate for this family that they had a person that cared enough to see through the crap that was handed to him. I could tell when one the cops was lying. He would not look the defender in the eyes. His eyes moved to the side when he answered the questions. It is unfortunate that a black person has to be punished because of the color of his skin. I read the book about the black man being dragged behind a truck by three white men. They were finally found guilty after many years. I can't remember the title  but it was the same premise. Whites doing whatever they want with blacks. I am sure the child in the movie will be traumatized for a long time  if not forever. I pointed out to my mother that most serial killers and pedophiles are white. No comment from her. I want to commend the director and producer of this film. I feel the exposure they gave to this blatant injustice was a necessary project. I am an avid viewer of indy films. I feel that they are well written and have substance. I am pleased that I happened to grab this movie on the shelf. I felt compelled to write a comment because of how strongly I feel about the film and the prejudice that continues to exist in our modern society.,positive
This is a fascinating documentary about a 15 year old black lad who is accused of murdering a tourist in Florida and the subsiquent court case that follows. What this film shows is how corrupt the American police system is and how easy it can really be to convict an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks one black man looks very much like another and sod it if he rots in jail because i said he was the man who murdered my wife.The star is the defence lawyer who is brilliant at not only his job in court but he also did he what the police should have done all along. Fascinating stuff. 7 out of 10.,positive
I happened to leave HBO on last night following Six Feet Under. What ran next has left me speechless. What an incredible piece of work. I don't just recommend this  I MANDATE that you see this. It's better than anything Hollywood could ever ruin. I just hope they never get their hands on it.,positive
I gave this film my rare 10 stars.<br /><br />When I first began watching it and realized it would not be a film with a strong plot line I almost turned it off. I am very glad I didn't.<br /><br />This is a character driven film  a true story  which revolves mainly around the life of Rachel Nanny Crosby  a strong  beautiful (inside and out)Black woman and how she touched the lives of so many in the community of Lackawanna.<br /><br />Highly interesting not only its strong characterizations of Nanny and the people who lived at her boardinghouse  but also it gives us a look at what life and community were like for African Americans in the 1950's  prior to integration  and the good and bad sides of segregation and how it ultimately affected and changed the Black community.<br /><br />In addition to excellent performances by all members of the cast  there is some fine singing and dancing from that era.,positive
I don't need to say much about how good this documentary is--it's truly an amazing piece of true narrative. The story is simple enough: a white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in Florida  and the boy who is arrested is mistreated and put on trial with only the public defender and his family on his side. It's very enthralling  and the public defender is a joy to watch in all his human ways--you can't help but pull for the triumph of justice  and the ending fulfills more than could be expected of a true story.<br /><br />It's a shame more people haven't seen this documentary  but hopefully you will find a way to watch it. For those interested in race relations in the United States  and the actual workings of law enforcement and the legal process  it's well worth your time and effort to find this documentary. I give it a 10.,positive
I absolutely adored this movie. For me  the best reason to see it is how stark a contrast it is from legal dramas like Boston Legal or Ally McBeal or even LA Law. This is REALITY. The law is not BS  won in some closing argument or through some ridiculous defense you pull out of your butt  like the Chewbacca defense on South Park.) This is a real travesty of justice  the legal system gone horribly wrong  and the work by GOOD lawyers - not the shyster stereotype  who use all of their skills to right it. It will do more for restoring your faith in humanity than any Frank Capra movie or TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. And most importantly  I wept. During the film  during the featurette included at the end of the DVD - it's amazing. Wonderful film; wonderfully made. Thank God the filmmakers made it.,positive
I'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it can't be accused of unfair bias. With absolutely no cause  the Jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white  foreign tourist. They picked a 15 yr. old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him. In addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager. It makes one question whether as a society we should compensate those who are charged  imprisoned and subsequently found innocent. This docudrama is well produced  professionally recorded and presented in a captivating package from which you won't want to take a 1 minute break. If you care about social justice  don't miss this one. It certainly deserved its Oscar.,positive
This is a pretty obscure  dumb horror movie set in the 1970s Everglades. It is really stupid and lame for the first half  then it actually starts to get good for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends interspersed with shots of a church group singing  I don't know. It is mesmerizing. I was impressed with the night time scenes  because it actually looked like night  unlike most low budget horror films where it still looks like daytime. I feel like the director was really talented but was working with a miniscule budget and a tough schedule. There are a few scenes towards the end  the one mentioned above and also the end credits that are extremely cool. This movie could have been a genuine classic if it left its Scooby Doo conventions behind and went straight for the throat. I was surprised at how good this movie turned out to be. I couldn't take my eyes off of it  and I had to ask myself why?,positive
I give it 8 out of 10 because it is a cult classic. Also it is directed by legendary sasquatch hunter Robert W Morgan who also plays the part of Jarvis in the film. In listening to recent blogtalkradio show called the AARF show(Robert Morgan is a co-host)he tells that because it has become such a cult classic and does well at movie conventions and such there are plans to maybe do a sequel to this film. I think he said that two of the original stars have signed on and he hopes to have a few more. Robert is a good man and I hope it does well. He has devoted 50+ years of tireless work as a Sassquatch Researcher(which is also one of my interests)and author. Check out his show on the paranormal and maybe look for Blood Stalkers II sometime in the near future.,positive
Quality entertainment all around. The spectacle of Kermit on his bicycle is one thats as memorable as ANY in cinema history. There's just not a bad thing to be said. Tons of muppets  great cameos  slapstick  puns  whatever you want  its here. The lovers  the dreamers  and me INDEED.,positive
First of all  before I start my review  I just read every review for 'The Muppet Movie' here and I can't believe that someone could give a negative review to a movie like this. (Fortunately there was only one.) I mean  I can understand how someone may not like 'Star Wars' due to the whole Sci-Fi genre  but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad. <br /><br />Okay  I will step off my soapbox now and review this movie.<br /><br />'The Muppet Movie' came out when I was seven. All of my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie  so I think I saw it about four times in the first month in theaters.<br /><br />As a child many things attracted me to this and all the other Muppet movies & TV shows. The singing was probably the main one. Most of the songs in 'The Muppet Movie' are classics. From Rainbow Connection to I'm Going to Go Back There Someday  they're entertaining and thought-provoking.<br /><br />As an adult I see 'The Muppet Movie' in almost a whole different light. Yes  the things that thrilled me about it as a kid are still there  but it's the little jokes and such that are just plain hilarious.<br /><br />I mean  when you think about it  Jim Henson is a sick man. <br /><br />Kermit is a frog and that is in love with a sweet pig that wears purple gloves and could karate chop you into two pieces. Fozzie is a stand-up comedian bear. Gonzo is a 'whatever' that is infatuated with chickens. Then you have two old guys that heckle  a piano-playing dog  a rock band with a maniac drummer  a Swedish chef that you can't understand and a number of other characters that are just plain eccentric.<br /><br />Yet  for these reasons and more  Henson has entertained millions of children and adults  giving us all something special to watch and remember him by. <br /><br />'The Muppet Movie' will always remain in my heart for many reasons  but I think the biggest one is because it's a movie  unlike a lot of recent children's movies  that I feel comfortable to have my kids watch. Plus  I don't get bored out of my mind with jokes that are dumbed down to my kids' level.<br /><br />It's a great movie that is sure to be remembered forever.,positive
"This wonderful movie captures so many elements of what makes a family comedy funny  entertaining  sweet and memorable  it's difficult to decide where to start.<br /><br />From the opening number  Rainbow Connection, Paul Williams's excellent score sung with gusto by Kermit D. Frog  which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about  throughout the story  this is one fun movie.<br /><br />Essentially  it's a road trip movie  where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain. Along the way  our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors  comedians  singers  and musicians  who coincidentally  are muppets like Kermit himself. Is this how the Muppets really started? Approximately how it happened, Kermit tells us.<br /><br />Not since It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World has the cameo formula been used so prolifically and successfully. The aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some just blink across the screen  but others have very memorable cameos. Steve Martin's amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best. Puppeteer Jim Henson's nod to his inspiration  Edgar Bergen  is especially touching.<br /><br />Anyone who ever watched the Muppets TV show will get to see all of their favorite characters  they're all here. The puppetry work is magnificent; look especially for Kermit riding a bicycle (how dey do dat???) In-jokes and references to old movies are everywhere  but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit himself. An example: when the crooks are terrorizing Kermit and Piggy  she affectionately says to her short  green  and handsome beau  I wouldn't give up this evening together for anything, would you? Uhhh, make me an offer.... I also love the gunfight at the OK Corral scene: brilliantly absurd silliness.<br /><br />Gotta get Movin' right along now  but to summarize: a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone  regardless of age or movie genre taste. Highly recommended.",positive
I only went to see this movie because I have always liked Kevin Costner. I felt that Ashton did a great job in the Butterfly Effect. Unfortunately  even though these two actors were/are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here. Some of the scenes were just not believable and didn't have enough story line support.<br /><br />Though the movie claims influence from the hurricane Katrina aftermath  there was very little (none) to that effect in the movie.<br /><br />Overall  I liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective.<br /><br />The special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating. Not sure I'll ever go deep sea fishing again...<br /><br />I expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented.<br /><br />Definitely a movie that could've been seen on DVD.,positive
As Muppet movies go  this is easily and clearly the best. It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age  a solid script  and some great Disneyesque songs  and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Henson's talent. The story is basic  and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed  without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable.<br /><br />This is simply fun  but it is also a well made  well written  beautifully endearing classic.<br /><br />It rates an 8.9/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.,positive
Looking back on Jim Henson's works years after his death is like taking a look back into another time. For unlike most so-called creative types attempting to sell to  or worse yet cynically exploit  children nowadays  Jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child. And if there ever was a moment in which he demonstrated this  Labyrinth aside  it is 1979's Muppet Movie. Filmed as an allegorical story about how Henson came to work in children's television as a puppeteer and ended up with a half-hour show of his own on primetime television  The Muppet Movie ends up an affirmation of everything more progressive  understanding sorts would say to children who did not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s. And as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and bound from speaking about anything lest someone might get offended  the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of The Muppet Show is on offer here. I have said it in other comments  but I must say it here. A great light in the world went out the day Jim Henson died.<br /><br />The Muppet Movie begins with its cast sitting down to see the premiere of what were about to see for the next eighty or so minutes. In short  precise strokes  we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the minors. And when the story proper begins  boy are we given a great song to bring us into the moment. The Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the Muppets  especially Kermit  were. These were not just a bunch of felt puppets with singular personalities who combined to put on a show. They were living things based upon a part of all of us  only writ so much more boldly than we are used to. As each Muppet was introduced to us in turn  we saw another reflection of part of ourselves  and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character. Hence  everyone had a favourite. When Animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal  I knew I had found one of mine. Nowadays  I am more of a Swedish Chef fan  but what the hey.<br /><br />Complementing the characters was a string of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities. Can You Picture That? shared an insight into Dr. Teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of Henson. But the most relevant song to me was Gonzo's number  asking what he is and where he came from. Many of us would spend a lifetime gazing into the stars and  like Gonzo  saying we knew we would be going back there someday. Not that all the songs were so deadly serious  of course. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent (or lack thereof) and hit the road. If any evidence were required that present-day musicians have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something listenable  this number would be it. Never before  and never again  would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly complement one another. With the puppeteers and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game  the human cast had a lot to live up to.<br /><br />Which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the deal. Cameos literally pepper the film  with everyone from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas popping in to offer their support. Even Richard Pryor  the last man one would expect to see in a film about the Muppets  appears to set up a hilarious moment. Mel Brooks' cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when I was a small boy  but I suspect that is because Henson knew why I would find it disturbing now. The big acting strength  though  comes from Charles Durning  who as Doc Hopper embodies everything both Henson and his audience determined to resist. At every junction  Hopper comes to either offer Kermit the chance to sell out and betray his own kind. Or perhaps offer stops being the right word when Hopper's attempts to ensure Kermit's compliance become progressively more forceful and violent. The whole thing is one big metaphor for how every artist has his heart broken by the world.<br /><br />Of course  Animal also shows up to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly does not make them any less of a friend. In point of fact  Animal turns out to be the best friend that Kermit has in that moment. And that has been the core message of every good show or film Henson has been involved in ever since. That shunning or dismissing others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake one ever makes. There can be little doubt that in today's world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not come under serious investigation by child welfare authorities  Henson's creature workshop could never have got off the ground. To misquote the album title  daring to be stupid is one thing  but enforcing the choice upon others is another matter. The Muppet Movie demonstrates how Henson dared to ask us all to think  both inside and outside of the proverbial box. There will never be another entirely like him  but he never would want us to stop trying.<br /><br />Therefore  The Muppet Movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten film. If we were to send a film out into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being obliterated  this would be it.,positive
"The Muppet movie is an instant classic. I remember the opening scene with the bird's eye view of the swamp and Kermit starting into (in my opinion) the most loved song in the history of songs. At this point my mom would always sing along with Kermit.<br /><br />Watching this title as a young adult it makes me smile. I can still sing along to my heart's desire. Like many Muppet films there are in jokes for adults that are( In my opinion) still funny today. My favorite line of all time is actually from this film  it's the last line spoken by my green  goggle eyed hero Kermit Life's like a movie , Write your own ending. That's what I intend to do! Thank you Jim Henson.",positive
"Why are there so many songs about rainbows, and what's on the other side? Kermit poses this relatively simple double interrogative near the beginning of The Muppet Movie while singing his signature song  The Rainbow Connection. As time goes by  the question and the movie only gain profundity.<br /><br />I'm going to forgo the review of this movie as a children's comedy  but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more warmth with each passing year.<br /><br />As the milestones in my own life come creeping up on me  I hear more and more the evocative strains of that elementary ditty  and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyone's life  because we all dream. And that is what this movie is about. It's not just a bunch of puppets-- it's a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams  which is a good lesson for everyone.<br /><br />And while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good  they're not a fair judge of the movie. Only The Rainbow Connection and the powerful emotions it will realize. And it all fits in: Rainbow Connection *is* the Muppet Movie  and vice versa. It's existentialism meets children's entertainment-- there's no simpler way to describe it.",positive
"A delight from start to finish.<br /><br />If you don't like the Muppets  then I just have to feel sorry for you. This terrific film doesn't simply cash in on the Muppets' popularity -- it's a well-conceived and well-written film in its own right. It's got great songs  and it has that thread of wistful melancholy that was always present in Jim Henson's creations and which is most personified in the character of Kermit the Frog. I always responded to this as a kid  and it's what makes the Muppets still enjoyable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children drives me crazy.<br /><br />A huge cast of big names appearing in cameos makes this film feel like a kiddie-sized version of Around the World in 80 Days, except that it's about 80 times better.<br /><br />Grade: A",positive
I enjoyed THE MUPPET MOVIE very much. It was the first of the Muppet movies and is by far the best because it's so creative and fresh. With later films  the ideas just didn't seem quite so original. But here  we get to see Kermit and Miss Piggy riding bikes (an incredibly difficult scene)  an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun. I loved every minute the Muppets were performing and I would have rated the film a lot higher except for one serious problem. In this and most subsequent Muppet films  some powers that be felt there was a need to include lots of non-Muppets--in particular  many  many cameos by stars. Some worked fine (such as Charles Durning's) but many just seemed irrelevant and slowed the picture to a grinding halt. Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan. Yes  he was an amazing man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew  but the tiny scene he's in just wasn't needed nor were most of the cameos. Still  despite this big complaint  it's a great film for the entire family--from the kids to even the most demanding adults.,positive
The first feature-length adventure of Jim Henson's beloved muppet characters is a very competent musical comedy vehicle as Kermit The Frog leaves his carefree  swampy surroundings for the bright lights (egged on by stranded Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who overheard him singing); on the way  he meets Fozzie Bear (a pitiful stand-up comedian at James Coburn's El Sleazo Café who has Telly Savalas for a bouncer and Madeline Kahn a patron!)  the piano-playing dog Rowlf  bestial drummer Animal and his laid-back  funky band  egomaniacal beauty queen Miss Piggy (in a ceremony presided over by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen)  etc. All the while  Kermit et al are pursued by frogleg burger magnate Charles Durning and reluctant acolyte Austin Pendleton  sold cars  ice cream and balloons to by  respectively  Milton Berle  Bob Hope and Richard Pryor  served food by insolent waiter Steve Martin  nearly brainwashed by mad German scientist Mel Brooks and  finally  land an audition in the offices of movie mogul Orson Welles (who has Cloris Leachman for a secretary)! The pleasant song score comes courtesy of Paul Williams who also makes an appearance as the resident pianist at El Sleazo's. For the record  I have recently acquired four of the subsequent Muppet movies and should be watching them in the weeks to come when their turn falls due.,positive
Superb editing  outstanding acting  especially by Epatha Merkerson  and highly enjoyable musical soundtrack. This film reaches back to the 40's to comment on the racial lifestyle differences and some effect of desegregation while it weaves the true story of a truly admirable and fantastic lady.<br /><br />The actor portraying the young Terrence Howard character does a wonderful job reflecting the life and times of his upbringing in the small upstate New York town. The audience laughed  cried  and erupted in applause for the film and its director. <br /><br />Soon to be shown on HBO (Feb 7  I believe) - fire up the TIVO and enjoy a great story!,positive
I've Seen The Beginning Of The Muppet Movie  But Just The Half. Because I Only Watched It At Mrs Kelly's Friend's House. The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious. They Learn That If They Believe In The End Of The Rainbow  Anyone Can Make It  No Matter How Small  No Matter How Green(Which Was Included In The Trailer).<br /><br />Kermit Is My Favorite Protagonist(Which Means It Describes The Main Character) And So Are The Other Muppets. Mel Brooks Was Amazing When He Played Professor Max Krassman. The Scene Where Miss Piggy Saves Kermit By Doing Kung Fu On Those Guys. It Was So Cool.<br /><br />The Muppet Movie Is The Best Jim Henson Film With The Most Hilarious Characters And People Will Cherish For His Successful Film.,positive
If I rate the film maybe a bit high  you can blame it on sentiment. This is one of the first movies that I remember seeing and totally loving. I saw it at the drive-ins here in California in the late 70s. I was already a big fan of The Muppet Show on TV so I was primed for the movie  and the movie did not disappoint. Basically it takes the whole absurdist ethos of the Muppet show and transports it from vaudeville into a road movie. Kermit the Frog is on a quest to become famous; not because he wants to take champagne baths and ride in a private jet  but because he wants to make millions of people happy. Of course.<br /><br />Along the way he picks up all his beloved muppet friends  most endearingly Fonzie Bear who he meets at a seedy bar doing stand-up. They sing Movin' Right Along  a song that has always charmed me with its upbeat melody and its theme of friendship and shared discovery. He also encounters enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie  including comedy luminaries like Richard Pryor  Steve Martin  Edgar Bergen  Milton Berle  and Mel Brooks. Brooks in particular has a rather dull bit  and you are left feeling that Henson could have cut a few of these cameos out if he wasn't afraid of offending the stars. Anyway  as befits a road trip movie like this the very first person he meets is Dom DeLuise.<br /><br />The ending is one of the more odd examples of literally breaking down the 4th wall that you will find in any children's movie. The Hollywood dream seems to be crumbling all about them  when a real rainbow pierces the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery. I'm sure this was meant to relate to some of Jim Henson's own personal or spiritual experiences.<br /><br />This is the best movie with Muppets by a long shot. If you or anyone else was wondering why the Muppets were so popular back in the 70s  considering how poor the movies have been for the last few decades  I think this film has at least aged well enough to provide a clue.,positive
I always felt that Ms. Merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills. Familiar to millions as the Lt. on Law and Order  she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases  always in a supporting role. HBO's Lackawanna Blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as Nanny  successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration. But the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in Lackawanna  New York  a suburb of Buffalo.<br /><br />The story could be set in any major African-American community of the 50's and 60's from Atlanta's Sweet Auburn to New York's Harlem. But the segregation-integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at Nanny's boarding house. The story revolves around Nanny's relationships with all kinds of people  played by some of the best actors in the business (I purposely did not say black actors--this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black  except for Jimmy Smits  of course) I recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day.,positive
The Muppet Movie <br /><br />directed by <br /><br />James Frawley<br /><br />Kermit the Frog and friends relive the tales and stories of how they all came together.<br /><br />The Muppets star in their first feature film  bringing the magic they are known for to a bigger picture. The story is not too complex and is written as a prequel of sorts. The well written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction. The cameos aren't just thrown in either  but written in as interesting characters  making one of the many peaks for our furry friends.,positive
I am 17  and a biased Muppet fan  and while I love Treasure Island  Christmas Carol and Great Muppet Caper  The Muppet Movie absolutely deserves to be up there with the best of them. It is enormously entertaining  thanks to the snappy script by Jerry Juhl  and the film looks lovely  with some beautifully staged musical numbers. Speaking of the songs  I really liked them  sure they aren't the best song score out of the Muppet franchise  but they were very nice to listen to  especially Never Before. Never Before is now one of my favourite Muppet songs along with First Time It Happens and Professional Pirate. The Muppets as usual were fantastic  particularly the always delightful Miss Piggy  and the chemistry between Kermit and Fozzie was great. And what a brilliant human cast- from Bob Hope to Orson Welles  from Madeleine Kahn(the same wonderful actress who brought us hilarious movies like What's Up Doc?  Blazing Saddles and Clue) to Cloris Leachman  from Steve Martin to Richard Pryor  all of whom made memorable guest appearances  if careful not to overshadow the Muppets in a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox,positive
Who doesn't remember The Muppet Movie???<br /><br />Kermit the Frog is now an American culture icon. What child doesn't appeal to this character?<br /><br />As the first actual Muppet film  the movie simply called  The Muppet Movie did very well. Kermit takes a Hollywood agent's advice and goes out of his home swamp to respond to the ad. Along the way he meets up with a pig  a bear  chickens a rock band and a few other quality puppets. Watch for dozens of cameo appearances like Madaline Kahn  Steve Martian  Richard Pryor  Mel Brooks and several more. I grew up watching this movie and I loved it.,positive
"A bunch of full-length movies featuring the Muppets  created by Jim Henson & Co  have been made  but The Muppet Movie was the first one of them all  and the first in the original trilogy  which also features The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan. It was released seven years before I was born  so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released). However  I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood  mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990. I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties  after hearing the soundtrack. Unsurprisingly  I liked it at the time  and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.<br /><br />One day  while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing Rainbow Connection  a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown. Kermit takes his advice and goes west. He soon meets Fozzie Bear  an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant  and convinces him to come along. The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper  the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot. As a frog  Kermit is disgusted by this  so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie. On their road trip across the country  Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them  including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately  as they all try to make their way to Hollywood  Doc Hopper  assisted by Max  is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot  so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger! <br /><br />One thing many people praise this film for is the songs  and I can understand why. There is  of course  the Oscar-nominated Rainbow Connection at the beginning  and more good tunes follow  such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song  Movin' Right Along  and I'm Going to Go Back There Someday  a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo. Never Before, Never Again  the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit  is the only one I would consider rather weak  and their romance seems awfully sudden. The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable  just like they are on TV  and some of them provide a lot of the humour  including Fozzie  making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up  and  well  if you're familiar with these famous Muppets  you should know what to expect from each of them. Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny  such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the Insolent Waiter. Also  it's not 100% comedy. There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.<br /><br />Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing Muppets from Space (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death  released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw that film  which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters! Not only is that movie not very funny  I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets  as I stated in my review of it! However  I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors  including this one  released twenty years earlier. The Muppet Movie seems to be the most popular of the bunch  and since it has so much to like  not just for kids  that's understandable. I highly doubt there's much left to say about The Muppet Movie that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years  but today  it remains good family entertainment.",positive
I have always loved The Muppets. Though most children's entertainment then wasn't that likable  The Muppet's was. The Muppet's are very  very funny. They are probably the most likable children's characters ever. <br /><br />Not only did The Muppets have their own show. They also have starred in many films. from The Muppet's Christmas carol to The Muppet's treasure Island. The first Muppet's movie  The Muppet movie  was also  like the show and the other films  excellent.<br /><br />The Muppet movie is about how they all got started. Kermit the frog used to live in a swamp. Until one day a movie executive tells him that there are auditions for frogs in Hollywood. So Kermit takes off for Hollywood. Along the way he runs into lots of people such as Fozzie Bear  Gonzo the great  and Miss Piggy. Also  an evil man is trying to capture Kermit.<br /><br />All of the Muppet films are highly enjoyable. I mean they are all very funny. This film has many film appearances. Such as Steve Martin  Mel Brooks  Elliot Gould  Carol Kane  Richard Pryor  and Orson Welles. The Muppet films are all very enjoyable. I hear that Jason Segel is going to star in one soon. I can't wait to see it.,positive
I have not seen this movie since 1979 when I was a teenager. I grew up with the Sesame street muppets and later realized how much effort and time went into bringing these characters to life. Jim Hensen was a genius and master muppeteer. When I watched this movie the other day it took me back in time when I was younger and things seemed so much simpler. For this bit of time travel I rate this movie a 10.<br /><br />The plot line explores how Kermit goes from the swamp to Hollywood. The laughs and gags are classic muppetism. I am glad these films are still around for the next generation. I hope I never out grow the magic of the muppets.,positive
This film is one of my fondest childhood memories. Seeing the Muppets (at the height of their popularity) heading Hollywood  singing and dancing  with Miss Piggy googely-eying her beloved Kermit  Fozzie Bear doing his best as everyone's manager  and a generous cast of extras delivering a film that turned out to be okey dokey.<br /><br />Kermit's melancholy ukulele number Rainbow Connection was nominated for an Oscar that year  but was beat out by Norma Rae's It Goes Like It Goes. I'll pick Kermit's song any day! Get the kids and enjoy this timeless fantasy...someday they'll find it  the rainbow connections  the lovers  the dreamers and me!,positive
The first feature length Muppet Movie  and excepting maybe The Muppet Christmas Carol  the movie puppeteers the world over are still looking for as a guide. Disney has done the Muppets a dis-service and this movie proves it over and over again. Featuring classic comedians and guest star cameos  keeps to a simple but original plot  classic Muppet lame jokes  Paul Williams genius in song writing  and Electric Mayhem madness  and comes off with an amazing movie especially when you realize that the major cast are puppets. Only Croft has come close to Hensen's genius with puppets. Half of the fun today is playing is that cameo actor/actress still alive???? I can only hope Frank Oz and Dave Goelz and the rest of the surviving Muppeteers can somehow rescue and revive Kermit and Company from the deadly grasp of Disney.,positive
Who doesn't love the muppets?! Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm  fuzzy feeling inside. So  I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly. In fact  there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the magic transcends all that other stuff. 'Tis indeed what movies are made of.<br /><br />So  how does the film achieve these things? Hmmm  nice question! Stumped am I? Let's see. Really  I feel like it's quite simple. The filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process. I probably wouldn't say the film has many truly inspired moments  but it does have a certain life to it (that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack). A zest. You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing.<br /><br />Generally I get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren't afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel. Kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. Lots of talent  little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through. The cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance. Maybe I don't feel I have much to say about it because I was half-asleep when I saw it (and/or as I write this review). Anyway  I'm sort of semi-repeating myself here but I really liked the sense of family the movie had. Full of love I suppose you might say. Again  a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly.<br /><br />And to repeat myself once more  one of the film's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness being (like) a butterfly  so The Muppet Movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so. Same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that. Anyway  if that sounds sappy  I also reckon it was pretty hilarious.<br /><br />So  all in all  this movie was very funny  touching and difficult not to smile along to. Plus it features lots of great music! Highly recommended to all humans  both the young and the young at heart.,positive
I would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released. All these years later at 37 and I had no qualms hiring it on DVD. Great entertainment for all ages. And what about the song The Rainbow Connection? See:<br /><br />Why are there so many songs about rainbows And what's on the other side? Rainbows are visions  but only illusions  And rainbows have nothing to hide. So we've been told and some choose to believe it I know they're wrong  wait and see. Someday we'll find it  the rainbow connection  The lovers  the dreamers and me.<br /><br />Who said that every wish would be heard and answered When wished on the morning star? Somebody thought of that  and someone believed it  And look what it's done so far. What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing And what do we think we might see? Someday we'll find it  the rainbow connection  The lovers  the dreamers  and me.<br /><br />All of us under its spell  We know that it's probably magic...<br /><br />... Have you been half asleep? And have you heard voices? I've heard them calling my name. ... Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors? The voice might be one and the same I've heard it too many times to ignore it It's something that I'm s'posed to be... Someday we'll find it  the rainbow connection  The lovers  the dreamers  and me.<br /><br />Laa  da daa dee da daa daa  La laa la la laa dee daa doo...,positive
First of all i'd like to say that this movie is the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind. It is the best out of all the excellent Muppet movies  and every other movie out there! so BOO-YA for jim Henson!<br /><br />This Movie is the first of all the Muppet movies and the best. (boo ya) It's about a Frog (kermit) who tries to make to hollywood. along with the awesome friends he meets on the way comes a couple of the greatest songs ever made that are bound to become classics  including the rainbow connection<br /><br />in conclusion i would like to say that watching this movie was the greatest thing EVER!. If you havn't already seen it  then get off your computer and get you tushy to your nearest video store!!! (if they don't have the muppet movie  i'd sue them BIG TIME ),positive
Jim Henson as Kermit  Dr.Teeth  Rowlf and Waldorf.<br /><br />Frank Oz as Fozzie  Piggy and Animal.<br /><br />Jerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper  Robin the Frog  Lew Zealand and Crazy Harry.<br /><br />Richard Hunt as Janice  Statler Beaker and Scooter.<br /><br />Dave Goelz as Gonzo  Dr.Hunnydew and Zoot.<br /><br />Charles Durning and Mel Brooks.<br /><br />cameos by Steve Martin  Carol Kane  Orson Welles  Bob Hope  Richard Pryor and others.<br /><br />This is the first Muppet movie of the billion others that came out  and is also the best  by far! This deals with Kermit the frog going on a trip to Hollywood and meeting the other characters along the way. This movie  along with being already good  has excellent songs performed by the Muppets  including Rainbow Connection  Can You Picture That?  Moving Right Along and others. This movie  unlike the other Muppet flicks  carries a strong sentimental value to me. It's such a nice movie. Also noted is it's many cameos featuring Steve Martin  Mel Brooks and a dozen others.<br /><br />my rating-A plus. 109 mins. rated G.,positive
Y'know  it's very interesting watching this... half the people involved with it are now dead...<br /><br />Anyways  it's been a long time since I've watched anything Muppet related  but this stuff is pure gold. I'm a great fan of puns  and this movie has them quite well placed  but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing: it's not really high-speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth  it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go.<br /><br />Kermit the Frog is just an awesome character. His voice and the expressions on his puppet-face are fantastic. But above all  he points out why he's popular--he can sing and make jokes too!--but more appropriately why he's so endearing--he  without any effort  inspires everyone to search for their dreams. In the meantime  he also has to deal with himself  which is an uncommon theme in family movies.<br /><br />It also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there  some to great effect  others to a little less (I think Mel Brook's part was just a bit overplayed  do you?). Some parts of the film are just kind of odd. But it's highly imaginative and takes itself to the same destination from a very different direction.<br /><br />Moving right along...<br /><br />--PolarisDiB,positive
Jim Henson's The Muppet Movie is a charming  funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids. I feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters  great story  and great wit that it is irresistable. The plot involves Kermit the frog (puppeteered and voiced by Henson) in his odyssey across America to follow his dream in Hollywood. Along the way  he meets Fozzie Bear  The Great Gonzo (my favorite)  Miss Piggy  Rolf  and DR. Teeth and the electric mayhem.<br /><br />This film has so many good things I can't even say them. But it is memorable and every time I think of a puppet or muppet  I will think of this film. Look for cameos from Mel Brooks  Dom DeLouise  Paul Williams  Madeline Kahn  Bob Hope  Richard Pryor  Steve martin  Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthey)  Elliot Gould  Carol Kane and the great Orson Welles. Excellent and spectacular  one of the best films of the 70's. A++,positive
"In many ways  the perfect movie. The Incredible Journey and Horatio Alger tale come together for a positive spin on the usually depressing subject of existentialism. In essence  the travails of the muppets boil down to the finale song of the movie: Life's like a movie, write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending. They create their own reality  which has all the trappings of every epic tale: a lofty goal at the end of what is necessarily a obstacle-laden journey; an ever-increasing group of like-minded individuals for camaraderie; a nasty set of villians who are not beyond all redemption; and a big-budget Hollywood ending because  darn it all  they CAN.<br /><br />Only Jim Henson could pull this off. He walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without swerving too long or too hard into either. Of course it seems odd that invest such weight into a film starring puppets  but in the end perhaps they are the perfect  uh  puppet to make these points. The movie's atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the Hollywood dream  the happy ending  unnecessary cameos  and bursting into song at the drop of a hat. Usually these aspects are anathema to quality in film  but the self-deprecating manner under which the story is delivered makes for guilt-free viewing. One of the few films that can truly be called suitable for all ages.<br /><br />The other muppet-related films (including The Empire Strikes Back)  while palatable  do not touch the simple grace of this film. Take  for instance  the musical number Hope that Something Better Comes Along, the duet of Kermit and Rowlf. Amusing in its vaudevillian goofiness  yet makes a bitingly crucial point about the motivations behind life choices. Brilliant.",positive
MINOR SPOILERS<br /><br />Misunderstood classic remains one of Henson's finest and most personal films. It may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one 'misunderstood ' but people do seem to remember this one mostly for Jerry Juhl's snappy screenplay and Paul Williams's knockout songs. Now while these things are admittedly great  as is the movie's formal playfulness (screenplay-within-the-screenplay  film break  etc.)  what distinguishes 'The Muppet Movie' from the other Muppet films is the serious  wistful thread that runs through the picture. It's a road movie  all right  but like most road movies  the pleasure is in the getting there  and the achievement of the characters' goals is tempered by uncertainty  and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again. Throughout the film  we are shown the down side of show business  even before the Muppets have 'made it': Piggy abandons Kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent  Gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performer's life on the road in his haunting 'I'm Going to Go Back There Someday ' and  worst of all  Kermit is continually tortured and tested by Doc Hopper  who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes. (One can only wonder what Henson would have made of his family's management of the company after his death.) Kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene  and the final 'Magic Store' number questions whether it's all been worth it  before concluding that it probably doesn't matter either way. All this is punctuated with the expected Muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes  and of course the serious stuff wouldn't work if it weren't. But 'The Muppet Movie' isn't just another jokefest  as the rest of the diminishing-return Muppet films would become. No  it's a lovely  gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business  and it's every bit as effective today as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.,positive
This film is about aging Geisha in post war Tokyo. Okin  played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara  lends money to two other ex Geisha  Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki) and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it. Tamae has a son  Otomi a daughter  who during the film announce they're leaving them while Okin  never a mother  gets visits from two men in her past who  it turns out  just want money from her. Its a compelling tale of what choices you make  what you do to get through life and who you're responsible and beholden to. Haruko Sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding  less than compassionate Okin with an air of superiority that makes you not like her  but at the same time almost envy her. At a time when great films were made by Ozu  Mizoguchi  Kinoshita and Kurosawa  amongst others  Mr. Naruse is right up there with him. If you have a region free DVD player  you should attempt to find the two Naruse box sets released in England. I think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant. That they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece.,positive
Naruse is typically considered one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film  the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi. This is an interesting and honest film on the lives of retired Geishas. Whatever happens  when such a woman ages  and loses her charm and mystique? Well  for those who are interested  watch this film. One: Okin  is successful as a money-lender  but the other two have to borrow from her and are resentful. Okin doesn't have any children  but the other do. Okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her  and is excited. Naruse is a master in subtle studies of his female protagonists' characters. Bangiku ultimately draws the viewer into the study of the questions of ones happiness  and one's life-worth. Very good film indeed.,positive
The main reason for watching this picture is to savor the brilliant performance of S. Ephata Merkerson. Ms. Merkerson dominates this film with her tremendous presence as Nanny  the woman who believes in doing good  no matter to whom  with no strings attached. This actress clearly shows a range that is amazing.<br /><br />Thanks to director George Wolf for bringing this distinguished cast of some of the best Black Americans actors together. This ensemble group under his tight direction help create the right atmosphere in which the action takes place.<br /><br />Of course  none of this would have been possible if Ruben Santiago Hudson hadn't written his wonderful play. Working with Mr. Wolf  perhaps the best theater director of this generation  they have opened the play in a way that it evokes that not too distant past where a child lives under the influence of Ms. Crosby  when his own parents are not around to take care of him. Ms. Crosby becomes the adoring mother of little Ruben; in a way  he represents her reward for having lost her own daughter.<br /><br />Unfortunately  there is no time to develop some of the characters  as the action solely concentrates in enhancing the relationship between Nanny and the young Ruben  played with such charm by the young Marcus Carl Franklin  who is a natural. The only thing that could have been done differently was the voice over narration that is at times intrusive  as it doesn't clarify  or justify what one is seeing. Frankly  just by watching the interaction of the players  is self explanatory.<br /><br />In the background there is always music. No matter what hard times these people are going through  but Nanny's house is full of laughter and that glorious music that takes us back to that era.<br /><br />Aside from Ms. Merkerson  other notable performances are given by Terrence Dashon Howard  one of the rising stars of the moment. Mos Def  Jeffrey Wright  Marcy Gray  Louis Gossett Jr. Delroy Lindo  Rosie Perez  Carmen Ejogo  Jimmy Smits and the rest.<br /><br />Ms. S. Ephata Merkerson deserves to be seen by a wider audience. In Lackawanna Blues  she clearly demonstrates she can do anything she wants because of her enormous talent and charisma.,positive
A look at three geishas who are way past their prime. Now they look back on their pasts with fondness and bemoan their present. Kin (played by Floating Weeds' Haruko Sugimura) has sworn off men and has made a good living as a moneylender; everyone on the block owes her. The other two  Nobu and Tamae  wish they could land husbands  but are not foolish enough to believe they ever will. Meanwhile  their children - one has a son and one a daughter - are both about to get married (not to each other). Tamae is irked at how much prettier her daughter has become than her  and bitterly tries to convince her not to marry the man. Nobu's concerns about her son are more legitimate in nature  but they are also (understandably) self-serving. After her son leaves  she'll be alone. A bit into the film  two of Kin's former clients come looking for her  one a man so obsessed with her that he tried to get her to commit double suicide with him  the other one of her handsomest clients. Unfortunately  he comes for her money  not her love. The way I've described the film makes it sound unrelentingly depressing  but it's really not. Sad  but not fatally so. It's more bittersweet. Unfortunately  I only marginally liked Late Chrysanthemums. The story seems better when I look back on it  but it is very slow and dull. I actually nodded off twice during the film  and I wasn't at all tired before I started it. This is the kind of film that I can appreciate more than like; it reminds me very much of my reaction to a couple of Ozu's more famous films. 7/10.,positive
Mikio Naruse's examination of the lives of three idling  constantly complaining  single ex-geishas in post-war Japan is a wonderful character piece. They used to be friends in the old days but now their relationship is strained because one of the women has become a successful moneylender and the other two owe her. Although the moneylender is the only one who has become successful in this rebuilding economy  she is the only one of the three that has no children. The other two each have a child whom they depend upon for income  because neither of them work. Complications ensue when the kids decide to get married (though not to each other) and leave home. This leads to the bitter  grumbling old women to become even more bitter and grumbling  getting drunk and bemoaning their rotten children and inconsiderate friend the moneylender. Meanwhile the moneylender is herself unhappy  despite her fortunes. She has no one besides her young deaf maid to keep her company and chance encounters with two former lovers from her geisha days lead nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her. The three characters are all neck-deep in the quicksand of their own bored lives and are too weary to struggle much  usually opting instead to resign themselves to the futility of it all or  at the very most  toss complaints back and forth to each other.<br /><br />Late Chrysanthemums is very slow-moving and not much actually happens but Naruse  like all great directors  has the ability to do much with very little. I haven't seen much of his work but I suspect that this isn't his best  even though it is very good. The problem  I think  is that it all doesn't seem to amount to much. But the film is full of good points. Although it is cynical  it isn't overly so. Naruse seems to sympathize with his desperate characters  and he paints vivid portraits that make the characters seem even somewhat noble in the squalor of their self-made misery. While the film isn't a must-see  it is important as a fragment of the work of a great little-known (outside of his own country) director  precious little of which is available on video here in the U. S.,positive
For me  Late Chrysanthemums was interesting not only because it was my first film of Naruse I completely enjoyed  but because it was technically as modern and innovative as his 30s work I've seen. This doesn't mean innovative editing in the way Godard would introduce it with Breathless in 1959  but quite the opposite.<br /><br />The editing was as fluent as in the best of Hollywood films from the 30s/40s  but at the same time incredibly fitting regarding the way he was telling his story. Unlike them  it never purposefully accentuated anything or tried to make itself invisible but  together with the cinematography  made me feel like I was traveling on a gentle stream  constantly feeling the waves beneath me  like a gentle stroke of the hand or the almost unnoticeable rocking of a cradle. In this sense the film was comparable to Ozu's and Mizoguchi's work  but somehow even more subtle.<br /><br />What was so modern was the fact that the editing seemed almost a character in itself  similar to the remarkable camera-work in Dreyer's Ordet (1954) or Vredens dag (1943) which is revealing us a deeper understanding of the film and its characters rather than simply showing them to us.<br /><br />I feel that Naruse's editing and cinematography are the most interesting aspects of his films  elevating the stories significance beyond the obvious. The wonderful sets and settings shouldn't be forgotten either! I found the story itself to be rather conventional.<br /><br />The narrative and its characters were introduced in a very interesting way  and I thought that the first half of the film was setting up a delicately ingenious spectrum of emotions and interrelations. Unfortunately the second half of the film and its resolution were rather didactic and and formulaic compared to the set up (though by itself it would have been perfectly fitting in any other - less complex - film). Somehow I felt that he failed a bit in trying to dissolve the many layers he had woven. Maybe he should have kept them intact. This criticism might seem a bit harsh to a viewer of this film  especially since the procedure is again reminiscent to the way Ozu dealt with the plot in his films. Unfortunately I haven't yet the feeling that Naruse was able to elevate the story and its characters in his films' conclusions in a similarly sublime fashion. The best efforts I have seen to date - Ukigumo (Floating Clouds / 1955) and Midaregumo (Scattered Clouds / 1967) - sustained the energy he had built throughout the narrative  while delivering poignant and resonant endings.<br /><br />This is already more than most director's are able to do  and in my opinion the basis for a real mastery of the cinematic medium. In this regard  and considering the resonance of the last two films I've seen by him  he may have already become one of my favorites.<br /><br />The only problem I have at the moment  is where I'm going to see more of his films on the big screen.,positive
Sadness and nostalgia permeate Late Chrysanthemums  a 1954 film by Japanese auteur Mikio Naruse  now undergoing a retrospective of his long unavailable films thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation. Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi  Late Chrysanthemums tells the story of four retired geishas  now middle-aged  whose lives have become full of disappointment and regret. Performance are uniformly outstanding  particularly that of Haruko Sugimura  who starred in films by Ozu's Late Spring  Floating Weeds  and Tokyo Story among others. Sugimura portrays Kin  a former Geisha who has no children and lives only with her young maid who is unable to speak.<br /><br />She has become cynical about men and has turned her attention to money  particularly real estate speculation and loaning money to her friends  Nobu (Sadako Sawamura)  Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa)  and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki)  all former geishas. Kin's friends live in meager circumstances and complain about how Kin has become greedy and Tomi spends considerable time gambling to try and make ends meet. Both Tomi and Tamae are in the process of losing their children. Tamae's son is leaving to work in the coalmines in Hokkaido  and Tomi's daughter has decided to accept a marriage proposal from an older man. Both resist the change in their circumstances but come to accept it as inevitable.<br /><br />Two male friends visit Kin  Seki a former lover with whom she once contemplated double suicide  and Tabe (Ken Uehara)  another lover who she looks forward to seeing again after many years. Her mood is upbeat but soon turns to resentment when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. Naruse cuts between two extended sequences seamlessly as Kin confronts Tabe and Tomi and Tamae console each other over the loss of their children The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who  though their future does not seem bright  refuse to see themselves merely as victims. Late Chrysanthemums has the simplicity  humor  and stoic acceptance of life prominent in the films of Ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passing of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring along the way.,positive
Subtle  delicate  touching.<br /><br />A young man in a summer dress on a bike like incarnation of perfect joy. History of a coming -out and anatomy of relationship.<br /><br />Soft ambiguous gestures  slices of desire and a day like space of innocent miracle expression.<br /><br />Two men  a girl  a afternoon on beach  some words and a gift. Religious traces and a pantheist vision. Cercle of light and expression  nooks of an ordinary day and hot evening.<br /><br />A erotic chaste film in which the gay identity or the first sexual relation are only instruments for good definition of a universe with sensitives values.<br /><br />Pledge for self- discover  universe of beauty exploration  the sign of Ozon and same nostalgic air of every creation  Robe d'ete is a splendid occasion to understand the moment like projection of dream  to look  with emotion and child soul the essence of the essence beyond the images or people.,positive
i expected it to be good  after i'd seen some other ozon's superb moments  and read much about it... but this movie is brilliant - clever  very bright (emotionally and visionally)  perfect in all moments. every movement is there for a reason  everything fits so closely and primordially true and honest. this is the movie about the beauty and innocence; about it's simplicity.,positive
There's not a dull moment in Francois Ozon's Robe d'Ete. It's surprising how much is packed into this short film. While reclining on a deserted beach after a nude swim  a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette. She invites him to make love in a wooded area near the beach. On returning to the beach. they find that all his clothes have been stolen. She lends him a summer dress to cover his nakedness and requests he return it next day. He rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl. His gay companion is sexually excited. Early next morning the young man returns to the sea and bids farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended. She suggests he keep the dress as a memento of their summer romance. It's a light-hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea  but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes.,positive
I'm just starting to explore the so far wonderful world of monsieur Ozon. I've seen only 4 films so far  and with the last one in the row it hit me that all of them were in fact about lonely women and their actions. Not a single non-lonely female character out of 12  and all of them bring heavy impact of surroundings.<br /><br />This film is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for good.<br /><br />The gay theme is an almost standard part of background for Ozon's films  so it doesn't grab the accent (although the looks of the characters might). Watch for the feelings  not for their objects.<br /><br />Very nice and fleeting  truly like a summer romance  and while being a relaxation to thought and mind  it gives some food for the soul.,positive
This is one of the movies one has to start watching with an open mind. One knows it's going to about a mute  one could look forward to or be afraid for a lot of sentiment.<br /><br />Well  forget it. The movie starts with a little black humour  and then gets started. From then on its takes you on an ever frightening ride through the dark centers of Moscow. All right  it must be said: the unexpected twists are expected  and the mute is mainly used as a plot tool or fear builder. But this movie doesn't let you go.<br /><br />It's like the old gangster movies  but then without any glamour at all and in Russia. And that's one of the most important aspects of this movie: it's situated in Russia. This does have a great impact on the movie  according to me it makes it better. Everything becomes simple and basic  life is without nonsense. This could be a great potential for more movies in the future  gangster movies about the Russian mafia.<br /><br />It is a beautifull and terrifying movie. It's horror  but you can't feel but sympathy for the little mute. One last advice: don't look this too late in the evening if you want to sleep well.,positive
First half of the movie scared the hell out of me and normally I'm not easy to scare  but second half of this thriller didn't work quite a well  but still very scary! A good thriller  than use simple ways to make good horror. Lowbudget  set in Russia  unknown cast  and made in Europe. but still great fun  and yes there is a few laughs throw in for good matters as well!,positive
If you want to see a true thriller  rent this!!! It's not from the director or screenwriter of Scream  doesn't feature overacting  overpaid TV actors passing off as stars  and is not a run of the mill special effects bonanza. Instead you'll get a top-notch  edgy  very strong (in violence) yet thrilling nailbiter.,positive
"The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is the character Rachel Nanny Crosby  who runs a boardinghouse and provides unflagging support to a young boy  Ruben  the narrator of the film. Based upon the experiences of writer-actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson  the film lovingly recreates the upstate New York boardinghouse and evokes the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. <br /><br />The first half of the film is virtually non-stop music. The second half addresses more completely the various characters in the boardinghouse. Nanny's ability to take fragments and make them whole affects everyone within her sphere. An especially vivid scene is when she confronts an abusive husband  telling him firmly  If you ever touch that child again, we're going to dance! As delivered by actress S. Epatha Merkerson  that line is so steely and filled with such resolve that the husband with the hair-trigger temper is frozen in his tracks. <br /><br />From start to finish  Merkerson delivers a commanding presence Her character binds together the disparate lives of the borders in her home. This was a touching  heartfelt film with a wonderful cast. As played by Merkerson  the character of Nanny simply radiates love. This is a film experience that I will remember for a long time to come.",positive
Well  this film came on on a workday at 230am. The cute little actress who played Billy caught my attention initially and after the 1st 15 minutes I was held captive to my television till the very end. It has you on the edge of your seat  then throws in clever bits of comedy during the most tense sequences.<br /><br />The only draw back is that the story was not substantial enough to fill hour an a half film  causing certain sequences to drag just a little. Nonetheless  it was still very entertaining  and I recommended it to all my co-workers the next day.,positive
Mute Witness is a modest  yet very solid thriller that never really received the attention or good comments it deserves. The film  written and directed entirely by Anthony Waller  is a tense  action-packed thriller with black comedy aspects and horror influences. No pointless mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twistsjust straight to the point mystery. Mute Witness handles about the vicious topic of `snuff'-movies and is effectively set in Russia. *** SPOILERS *** Since the production costs are cheaper there  a US film crew temporarily moves to Russia for shooting a horror film. An old hangar is used as film location. The female make-up artist of the team accidentally gets locked up overnight and while trying to find a way out  she witnesses the recordings of an authentic snuff-movie! She's caught and tries to escape but  since she's a mute  she can't cry for help and neither can she explain what she saw to the police properly. The girl's life is in real danger now  since there's a whole hidden network behind these snuff productions and they don't want the witnesses to be alive *** End Spoilers ***. Mute Witness contains multiple highly exiting action sequences and is rather bloody. Some of the mystery clues are effectively kept secret till the very end. Regarding the similar topic  I'd say it's definitely better than the more famous `8 mm'  directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Nicolas Cage. The acting in Mute Witness isn't great  but the leading actress (who's Russian herself) looks really cute. Sir Alec Guinness makes a special appearance  too. And a very cool one  I may say. Surely recommended with guaranteed fun and scares.,positive
This is a VERY good movie. I give it a 10.<br /><br />It's very different in that it's kind of a long stalking scene all the way through. The fact that the main character is mute is used throughout the story in a very believable way.<br /><br />She sees a murder (for a snuff-movie) and decides to run but is chased (this takes quite some time). I won't reveal the rest of the movie for it would spoil the experience  but rest assured: it's very believable  well played  very intense and has some nice surprises plus a great ending.<br /><br />Don't miss this movie.,positive
Superbly crafted low-budget thriller with more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at  and plenty of ghoulish humour along the way as well.<br /><br />The cast play it very well  although Richards' self-centered movie director is a bit hard to take at times. The tiny two-scene cameo by Sir Alec Guinness  oozing menace as the crime czar of Moscow  is simply the icing on the cake.<br /><br />Well worth repeated viewing  but not on dark nights when you're all alone!,positive
An intense thriller about a mute movie make-up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night. After she tries to get away from the murder scene  she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness. This movie leaves you on the edge of your seat.,positive
This is definitely one of the most scary and spell-binding films ever made. You are stuck to the movie from the beginning to the very end. Even though there are some plot holes  it keeps being exciting to the final showdown. Besides 8 MM and Peeping Tom this is one of the best films about Snuff Movies  a taboo theme of our culture. If you like the SCREAM Trilogy  you will probably love that one.,positive
I love this movie ! I think I've seen it 5 times already (it was quite a success in France and they often play it on TV). Ok  it's a thriller and there is great tension. But mostly (and specifically in the second part) it is absolutely hilarious ! And very original. The directing and photography are just splendid.,positive
I've waited 9 years to watch this film  simply because i never saw it advertised on TV. Eventually i caught it and it was well worth the wait. It's much better than your over-hyped scream or last summer garbage because it's all at a fairly quick pace  with no drawn out  creeping through the house to cheesy music scenes. Only the bad dubbing lets it down a little but don't let that put you off in any way. What lies beneath - over hyped and crap. Mute witness - low budget  not hyped at all and very good.,positive
The plot is somewhat original  and all the actors did their job pretty well. There is a plenty of comic relief  too. Some things do not make a lot of sense (e.g. the first chase scene  why would the heroine not just hide somewhere and wait until the baddies leave?). The Russians actually speak Russian without accent  but the cars are extremely strange  with models spanning like 50 years  and so the place seems weirdly out of time. Overall  if you like thrillers you will probably like this one as well.,positive
Fun  entertaining movie about WWII German spy (Julie Andrews!) falling in love with American pilot (Rock Hudson)  while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason this was attacked by critics and shunned by the public in 1970--I can't see why. It's beautifully shot  has wonderful costumes and interiors  and exciting aerial dogfights. Also it has Andrews doing a strip-tease (strictly PG material) and singing a beautiful song--Whistling in the Dark. The movie does have problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get along during the shooting of this--and it shows. Their love scenes lack spark and they have zero sexual chemistry. Still  they turn in OK performances. The film is a little long (even in the 105 min director's cut I saw) and gets way too dark and serious at the end. Still  worth catching. Try seeing the directors cut...the other one runs half an hour longer!,positive
I enjoyed the acting in this movie. Except for the sister. She reminded me of Janice on Friends. I could never quite believe she was anything but obnoxious. <br /><br />My main problems with the movie were the anticlimatic ending and the execution scene with the sister and brother-in-law. The guy falling out of the exploding car? Maybe if his hand had been blown off and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed him to a hospital  maybe then I could have gone for the ending. I think somebody needed to die in the execution scene. Mainly the brother-in-law. He was such a pain in the ass anyway. Or maybe the sister needed to accidentally kill the guy who saved the mute. I could have even bought into the brother-in-law killing the hero and the ending being the two sisters being put in snuff films. <br /><br />It is worth watching again and as I always say  it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of an author.,positive
This is  without doubt  one of my favourite horror films ever! I really cannot believe that it didn't gain much more popularity when it was released  especially when the main contenders at the time were the usual Wes Craven sequels and copycat horrors  Mute Witness has all the style  suspense and quickfire plot twists of a Hitchcock/DePalma movie  coupled with some very sharp black comedy and a great plot. It never promises to be any more than a good popcorn-and-hot-dog movie  but it is difficult not to just enjoy the film for what it is.<br /><br />The plot centres on Billie Hughes - a mute girl working on the set of a horror film being made in a Russian factory. By a series of events  she finds herself accidentally locked in  and stumbles on the filming of a snuff movie.<br /><br />One of the best things about the film is the lack of screaming that seems to invade every horror film ever made. As the main character is mute  she cannot make a noise - something which is a blessing at some stages of the movie  and a curse in others.<br /><br />The director seems to have studied his Hitchcock very well  Even the opening scene is a tongue-in-cheek nod to both Hitchcock's Psycho as well as fairly generic slasher movie scenes.<br /><br />While the acting can be hammy at times  the whole film does hold it together  not only throwing in a couple of excellent scenes that put you right on the edge of your seat  but a few neat little questions about how the film is going to end.<br /><br />All in all  a hugely overlooked  well-paced and action packed psycho-thriller which I would recommend for any jaded viewer looking for something a little different from the usual Freddy/Jason/Scream/Michael Myers/Damien regurgitation's at hallowe'en.,positive
It really is a great film (after being able to ignore Blake Edwards Pink Panther references which he appears to be obsessed with and are hugely unfunny). Julie is  as usual  wonderful - singing and acting brilliantly. I remember seeing it at the Odeon Cinema in the Haymarket  London on its release. However Julie's non-appearance at the UK premiere of STAR! was most unfortunate and (apparently!) due to filming the aerial shots for Darling Lili over Ireland. A reasonable excuse if she had appeared in any of these aerial shots but she did not. Two box office flops in a row ruined her film career for quite a few years. But Darling Lili just like STAR!  deserves much more public appreciation.,positive
One of my all-time favourite movies. Nothing can beat watching this movie for the first time. If I could go back in time and erase my memory or suffer from momentary amnesia I would so I could enjoy this movie as much as I did that very first time. It's still enjoyable second and third times round but I found myself appreciating the humour more as the shocks and thrills weren't unexpected. If you want a see a film that you truly won't be able to predict the ending of then I highly recommend this film. Its chilling  shocking  full of suspense and there's also loads of humour to help you through it too. If you watch this film and don't love it I truly question your sanity!,positive
I don't know how this film went unnoticed for so long.<br /><br />I saw this film on TV  i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film. i missed the first  probably   10 minutes  but that does not matter..this film literally gripped me  it is a real spine chiller.<br /><br />The absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new. U never know when they will get killed or what they are up to. so it is all the more tense.Even though there are many new faces their performances were top class.<br /><br />The filmmakers play with your mind  just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest. The shock  fear  horror and helplessness are also brought out well by characters in the film.<br /><br />The well written situations n twists fast camera movements  slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller. This film actually switches between the genres - horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and tensed. Undoubtedly comparable to Hitchcock. <br /><br />I could not even move from the TV even during the commercial breaks .. i was the helpless MUTE WITNESS to this superb film.,positive
Man  I never laugh so much this year  and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. While I expected some Hostel-style movie  the smile came to my face even from the beginning. This film-inside-film shows a female stabbed victim messing the whole set until she finally die. Her overacting drive the director nuts and his funny reaction tell us  the viewers  that Mute Witness is not a typically horror movie.<br /><br />The main character  the mute American make-up artist Billy Hughes  is played by the beautiful yet talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. Her performance is top-notch; her character can't speak  so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate.And  oh boy  she did a wonderful job. Her sister (Fay Ripley) is the girlfriend or the fiancée or the wife of the in-film director (Evan Richards). They were both very funny most of the time. I won't spoil more  but the scenes following the bathtub moment  with them two  the fake policemen and later the angry neighbor were plain brilliant black comedy.<br /><br />The plot get twisted near the end  possibly misleading at one particular moment. But don't worry. Such a delicious movie can be viewed in family or with your boy-/girl-/friend.,positive
In today's world of advertising and teenage horror and sensationalism it is very rare that one gets to see a movie and no nothing about it. Movies like Psycho and Blair Witch  while being great in suspense (both with great build ups) are spoiled by the fact that we know all about the best scenes and at least the plot before we see them. With Mute Witness  a rare treat  I stumbled upon this film and watched it  scared witless  in the middle of the night. I was scared by the menacing Russian ambience  the 'snuff' theme and the claustrophobic plight of the mute and the fact that the (amusing  which always leads to likeable) characters could meet the end at any second. Since this is a low budget and rare film we watch it without any expectations. It also has Fay Ripley in a rare movie role  watch and prepare to be excited  scared and thrilled in totally unexpected ways.,positive
I couldn't stop watching this movie  though it was far past my bedtime. <br /><br />Comparisons to Hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you. It walks a wonderful line between real  immediate suspense and a dark  distancing humor. Like many of Hitch's heroes  our doe-eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her  at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear  at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy.<br /><br />The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out. Right from the opening shots  they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication; who is to be trusted and who is a monster. The plot twists and turns unpredictably. Suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork  imagery  music -- but most simply THE EYES of the characters  which sends raw fear right into you. <br /><br />A warning: there is some frighteningly real gore  as well as some nudity. The horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage-slasher pic.<br /><br />And a teen-slasher pic it AIN'T. The characters are quirky and feel like real people  for one thing -- a couple (including the heroine) you may even find endearing as I did. There will be no mistake you're watching a movie made for grown-ups. I mean  Alec Guinness is in it  briefly  and you know he didn't NEED the work!<br /><br />Pop this in the VCR some night when you can't sleep. . . and don't want to  yet.,positive
The story is airtight from the beginning until the latter third of this movie. Then the story gets more and more outrageous. The Main character portrayed by Marina Sudina is fantastic and had a difficult role. This could have been a super-great movie had the ending been more realistic.,positive
It is always a well-known  and important directorial device to set up the atmosphere of a film within the first 5 minutes. In the crucial opening scenes  the film should assert itself and make the viewers take notice and get interested in the rest of the film. Here  in Mute Witness  we find a prime example of this.<br /><br />*Scene spoiler* <br /><br />In the first 5-10 minutes  the film opens to a very Hitchcockian scene of a pretty blonde lady in her apartment  with the radio on. She's wandering around  applying lipstick  dolling herself up  and ignoring the news report of a serial killer on the loose. Of course  the serial killer is in her house  and monitoring her moves  knife in hand. She hears a noise  looks in a room  and there is her partner in a pool of blood. At the very point of her screams  she turns around to be faced with the knife-wielding maniac  who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying act....<br /><br />...then something odd happens. As the woman convulses in her death throes  the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim perish. Before he finds his lighter  his cigarette is lit...from someone else in the room! The camera pans out  and we realise that there are more and more people in the room  some taking notes  some filming  some recording the death  and that the lady is taking an awfully long time to die  and making a very hammy job of it too. When the audience realises what's going on  and the whole scene is part of a film  the suspenseful and horrific scene takes on an element of humour.<br /><br />*End Scene Spoiler* <br /><br />I have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. Firstly  it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly. A thriller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma  with some very disorientating  and even blackly humorous moments. - It conveys a central subject matter (that of the difference between a 'movie screen death' and a 'snuff film death'  an issue which is elaborated on later in the film)  and finally  it introduces the viewer to the characters  all as silently as possible.<br /><br />The plot of Mute Witness centres around Billy Hughes  an American special effects make-up artist who is working on the set of the film  being shot in a large warehouse in Moscow. Billy cannot speak  but she communicates in sign language through her sister. After the end of an evening's filming  Billy inadvertently finds herself locked in the warehouse by accident  and in her attempt to escape  is witness to two of the crew making what first appears to be a porno film  but turns out to be a snuff movie. Suddenly  her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death.<br /><br />Without doubt  the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely gripping. Billy's saving grace  and her handicap is the fact that she isn't able to utter a sound. (In fact  in my opinion  one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it isn't chock-full of women screaming). There are some utterly disturbing moments  and some superb set-pieces of real suspense (The corridoor  and the elevator shaft are perfect examples). The timing is fluid  and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself.<br /><br />The second half of the film introduces new concepts. While there are still several suspenseful moments  the focus is on plot twists. New characters are introduced  and it is ambiguous as to whose side they are on. While there is nothing wrong per se with the second half of the film  it just doesn't quite measure up to the first half. There are some neat moments of black humour that perfectly juxtapose and punctuate some very dramatic scenes  but there are also some very lame comedy moments (coming specifically from Billy's sister and her fiancée  who happens to be the director of the movie Billy is working on)  that almost ruin the film  just because they are badly misplaced and/or mistimed and ruin the pace. - At the end  the twists keep coming at a rapid-fire speed  and the climax of the film is  appropriately  as tense as the first half.<br /><br />There are several things that really make the movie work. The barriers of communication that Billy must face  both as a mute  and as an American in Moscow  mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation. The actress that plays Billy  Natasha Zudina  does a wonderful job in the film  with an engaging on-screen prescence  and a brilliant performance  and finally  the direction as a whole  but most particularly in the first half of the film  which truly is a study in Alfred Hitchcock's suspense/thriller film techniques.<br /><br />As I have already said  though  the let-downs in the film are from some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added. There is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humour that appears in the film without the need for the characters of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (The sister and the moviemaker) to turn their scenes into some unusual sit-com. However  despite these shortcomings  the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller  and ideal for a group viewing at halloween. (Certainly better than the usual slasher horror film...!),positive
If you enjoy suspense this movie has it. The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense. Alec Guiness's appearance was nice  but didn't really add to the movie. I'm not sure if Evan Richard's part as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot. I thought the cinematography was excellent. This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well. The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful. Also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to Andy Clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done. I would call it overall good entertainment,positive
I went into this film expecting a slasher  and while Mute Witness does take influence from said style of film-making  this is much more than just your average slash flick. There are a number of thrillers that focus on a certain disability - blindness is more common (Blind Terror  Wait Until Dark  Cat o'Nine Tails to name a handful)  but the implications of having a mute lead in a thriller such as this are well portrayed  and actually integral to the plot as the fact that the lead character can't speak is often the reason why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to get out of. Our mute witness is Billy Hughes  a make-up artist working on a horror film production at a studio in Moscow. She finds herself locked in after hours one night  and after attempting to phone her sister for help  she stumbles upon what at first appears to be the making of an illicit sex flick  but soon turns out to be a snuff movie! She tries to convince the authorities of what she's seen  but finds that no one believes her story...<br /><br />Recently Hostel made the headlines for showing snuff movie making in a foreign country  but this film did it first and actually does a better job. It's maybe not quite as nasty as Eli Roth's opus  but the gore is more effective  and since director Anthony Waller (who went on to direct one of my favourite modern thrillers with 'The Guilty') implements a good sense of humour into the proceedings  Mute Witness is both sufficiently gory and fun to watch. The director certainly has a talent for crafting suspenseful thrill rides  as this one never stands still. The plot is put into action quickly  and Waller constantly introduces plot twists which give a big helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the film. The acting isn't bad for a B-movie  with young performers Marina Zudina  Fay Ripley and Evan Richards delivering good performances. The atmosphere is gritty  and the Russian locations are suitably unfriendly  which helps the film to retain a foreboding atmosphere. Overall  Mute Witness is a much better film than you might expect it to be. The plot flows well  and the atmosphere and tension are spot on.,positive
Billy Hughes is a mute young lady working for make-up on a cheap horror picture being filmed in Moscow by an American director. One night Billy gets locked in the movie studio. Later that night she hears that someone might be in the building and goes to check it out. That's when she stumbles across a woman being brutally murdered  while being filmed. After escaping the clutches of the murderers  Billy informs the authorities  only to be red-faced when the men show it was an act. Billy knows what she saw and soon her life is in turmoil again from underground figures that believe she has something of importance.<br /><br />I don't know how this heart-pounding sleeper passed me by  but I thought it was a much older flick. There's one thing though  it's got to be one of the most jarringly  and intense thrillers I've seen in quite a while. It's just a great suspense builder and mostly everything clicks into place! The first half of the feature is surprisingly gripping with taut sequences that have your heart in your throat and clouds us with an atmospherically foreboding environment of alienation. Underling this is a humorously wicked black streak. Faults do pop up in the story  as it does lose that furious grip it held so early and goofy humour (or better putter comic relief) between Fay Ripley and Evan Richard's characters is a hit and miss affair by being too forceful. In the long run  it probably could have done without. Despite some cringe moments  this aspect didn't hinder my enjoyment of it. For me  the soft ending they decided to go with just didn't feel right.<br /><br />The interestingly mysterious premise was eerie to the bone and packed some unsettling goods. So multi-facet was the context and its thrills  there was something fresh to how this all plays out and the nervy jolts and unbearable tension are weaved into a range of sudden plot turns and twists. Really  they made superb use of the novel idea of this disability and to handicap the situation  by staging it in a foreign place where not too many spoke English and so we are caught up in the confusion too. The delicate Marina Zudina gives a harrowing portrayal of the American mute girl Billy. The way she able to display the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave it some gruff and believability. Director Anthony Waller shoots the flick in a rather stylish  well-timed and skillful manner  without loosing that grimy look that eventuates from its rigid surroundings and a powerfully airy music score persistently nags at you. The only real name to make an appearance was small cameo part by Alec Guinness. The performances by the cast were all fine  especially the nail biting turns by Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as the Russian murderers.<br /><br />This riveting feature that's mostly made up of unknowns  is way better than your average dark thriller. Highly Recommended.,positive
Darling Lili is a mixture of Perfection and Magic! The Stars; Julie Andrews & Rock Hudson could not have done a better attempt if they tried. It's full of all the magic that a young lady wishes for and it makes it seem as if it can all really happen to you. The brilliance of the Director; Blake Edwards is shown to be at his best. He was truly capturing the woman he loved on screen!<br /><br />The blend of each song  went perfectly with the moment in the film. The Film opened with Julie Andrews singing Whistling Away In The Dark and closed with the same Song by Andrews.<br /><br />For A Film Of This Excellence To Have Been Such A Failure When It Was Released  Is A Total Shock...<br /><br />As It Is: Inspirational...Purely....Inspirational! ~One Of Andrews Most Memorable Lines In This Film!,positive
A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy  self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation  a little movie produced in Russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions.<br /><br />This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie)  it told the story of a mute make-up artist  Billie  who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sister's boyfriend Andy. She is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody. Overcome with horror she alerts the murderers of her presence  a chase ensues  and finally she is rescued by Andy who take her home as they alert the police. The trouble is... there is no body  no evidence that anything of the sort took place. Even so  a mysterious inspector seems to be on Billie's side of the story....<br /><br />And to say more would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is the kind of film that demands a scrutiny of viewing similar to the most intricate  clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller  it's one that pays its dues to movies like WAIT UNTIL DARK and the best of Hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts  deadpan humor  Americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless  and nail-biting suspense until it seems something must snap. Even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy  the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots (for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing swell of violins) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away. Very smart.,positive
An amazing piece of film that was well-conceived and kept me on the edge of my seat. Brilliantly orchestrated in its timing  and the comedy kicked in exactly when the tension needed a release. The acting was generally well-done (the Director should've asked Alec Guinness for acting lessons)  and the shot selections were impressive (as in elongating the hall as Billy tries to race to the door in the studio). This movie didn't let up since the opening scene...,positive
This may be the most tension-filled movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />In fact  it's so nerve-wracking  I haven't been able to watch it again after viewing it two years ago  but I will since I have the DVD. There were a couple of scenes in here that are almost too much to watch....so if you've got problems and need to escape for an hour-and-half this film will get your mind off anything else. <br /><br />The Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone  which she had to do since her character in here is a mute. She plays a cute and wholesome makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker. After the day's shooting is done and Billie is about to leave  she hears something. She takes a peek into the room where they were filming and discovers they are now shooting a snuff film and actually killing someone. Billie's eavesdropping is discovered and she runs for her life as the killers go searching for her in this big warehouse-type building.<br /><br />There are two extended scenes in which our heroine is running for her life and both of them will wear you out. The first I described above. The second scene  the climactic one  goes on too long and isn't as well done as the first. In fact  the film should have been trimmed a bit but  overall  since it's so good at keeping our attention  then it served its purpose as entertainment.,positive
I just finished this movie and my only comment is OH! WOW!. Jennifer Beals is ok as the fiancee  but Yancy Butler as the female dance instructor is pure sexual dynamite! Having watched her in WITCHBLADE  I was not prepared for the pure unadulterated sensuality and raw sexual excitement she launches onto the screen.<br /><br />I gotta see THIS movie again....if only for Yancy Butler as Corrinne!,positive
I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and must have been a labor of love for Eleanor Bergstein. The primary actors (Campbell Scott  Jennifer Beals  Yancy Butler  James Goodwin III  Patrick Stewart  and Leslie Caron) were very well selected and played their parts with excellence. It was a very uplifting movie that I wish was available on tape or DVD. A rare gem.,positive
Love this little film  that reminds me somewhat of the original Japanese gem  SHALL WE DANCE? (not the overblown Gere/Jlo remake...) Luckily I found it and taped it when it was showing on a STARZ Promo Weekend  because as far as I know  it's not available on DVD. I'll watch just about anything with Yancy Butler (anyone remember the short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???) in it  and she positively shines in this. She does a dance routine to a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT!! Loved all the other characters in it  especially the ones played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where's she been all these years?). This is one of those films that I take out from time to time and always come away smiling after watching it. Recommended highly!!!,positive
Meant to be some sort of a social commentary about the way that our lives were spinning out of control in the 1970's  this movie plays more like something Mr. Schlesinger threw together after having a bad day on the freeway. A mish mash of snippets about the nuts encountered along the freeway in Florida  and along the freeway of life  the cast is mostly wasted and probably ended up on the cutting room floor. The problem is that what DIDN'T end up on the cutting room floor probably should have! Now available on DVD  it's kinda fun to see a comedy that would have cost $100 million to produce had it been made in 2004. It rolls along and isn't too difficult to sit through  and  strangely enough  in 2004 we're all still pretty much just<br /><br />hopping in our cars and going faster and faster  heading nowhere.,positive
Back in August  '81 there was a country-ish buzz to movies  big hits like Urban Cowboy  Every Which Way But Loose  Smokey and the Bandit were all the rage. For that reason I suspect the producers of this movie chose Honky Tonk Freeway as the title hoping it would help the movie's box office receipts by drawing in that same Urban Cowboy crowd. Instead Honky Tonk Freeway bombed at the theaters and I suspect it do so in part by being burdened with a poorly chosen title. Thats same problem burdens it now on video and thats too bad because its a pretty good movie and in a comedy style ahead of it's time. No matter what  probably anybody who can remember 1981 will enjoy it.<br /><br />Its too bad this movie bombed. But I think it would have anyway even if it hadn't been saddled with a poor title. Its a movie ahead of its time. One could look at this movie now and see that its clearly a father or *great-uncle anyway) to the kinds of comedy made today. For its day Honky Tonk Freeway was pretty full of innuendo and a kind of frankness about life that didn't get popular in comedy till much later on. While clearly its a child of Airplane  its more mature  and while its certainly no Knocked Up it clearly points in that direction. The characters are more comedy-mature in that they are low-key and don't ever think anything they do is anything other than serious. The jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and the camera views and the way the view themselves and their situations.<br /><br />But  more than that  Honky Tonk Freeway is a real time capsule. A great look back at the exceedingly early 80's. The people in this movie are dressed and act as everyday people of 1981 did. It was clearly meant to reflect the times and be a sly comedic comment on everyday life around them.<br /><br />I don't know if my review is helping you  but this is really a good  sometimes kind of excellent  movie thats worth renting if you want to see how a lot of faces that are familiar today looked when they were 30 years younger. Beverly D'Angelo is so young its hard to realize its her sometimes. So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was just about to become the toast of Hollywood as her next movie after this one was Tootsie which finally made her a star. Howard Hessmann was arguably the biggest current star of the the day when this movie was made. Back in 1981 Howard Hessmann was the star of the big hit TV show WKRP in Cinncinatti. He played its lead character  the rascally night DJ. Daniel Stern was just about to break out as a star as the grown-up narrator voice of the lead child character in the popular 80's sitcom The Wonder Years There are also several faces that are no longer with us these days  its nice to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as a an old married couple on a journey. Jessica Tandy would finally pick up her Oscar ten years after this for Driving Miss Daisy. There is also the great Geraldine Page in one of her final movie appearances. Though she'd had a brilliant career she didn't get her Oscar till four years after this in 1985's Trip to Bountiful  for which she richly deserved it  and she died very soon after getting that award.<br /><br />Plus  there are lots of other faces in this movie  actors who aren't big stars but who have done tons of supporting work. Many are familiar even if you can't think of their name.<br /><br />This movie is a pleasant little diversion. A bunch of people with a variety of problems set out from various locations each for their own individual unrelated reasons who all  in a vaguely Altman-esk way  end up heading towards Florida and unbeknownst to them a rendevoux in the little town of Ticlaw  Florida  which happens to be reeling from the effects of being bypassed by the recently constructed interstate nearby which did not construct an exit to Ticlaw which effectively takes the town off the map.<br /><br />And thats also what this movie is about  fascination with the whole idea of the interstate system  which had only recently been completed. It had taken a generation to build  from when it was authorized by congress around 1960  through many years as different parts were built and then went live and by 1980 most of the system had finally been built and all connected together and first the first time the promise of what the interstate system would be had turned into what is. And people were enchanted by it. Everybody by 1980 was pretty much an interstate freeway veteran in the sense that by then everybody had used parts of it and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads in that it had no red lights or stop signs  only on and off ramps  and that it went to places that were formerly less accessible. By 1980 anyone could drive anywhere in comfort and without having to stop for anything except to eat and sleep and a bathroom. And this was all new then. <br /><br />The ending is anti-climatic and isn't that satisfying albeit its one spectacular moment. What makes it great is it's the journey not the destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless in spite of it being such a product of its day. Forget its title; instead let it take you down memory lane.,positive
A wonderful film ahead of its time <br /><br />I think so  In the eighty's it was all about winning  Greed is Good ? Remember that one ? I have seen this film more that 20 times  To me this is a real desert island film  I keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that I just love  Jessica Tandy  and Hume Cronin  are simply wonderful Also Beverly D'angelo  Beau Bridges come in at a close second  don't get me wrong there are many more great performance's in this film  and it is also the way it is written that made it for me  and I hope you  a film that you will want to see over and over  I think TV shows like Northen Exposure  and now Earl owe a lot to this film. but remember it is not a Tom Cruise film.,positive
I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was a kid. I loved it. Whilst I haven't watched it recently  I am sure I would enjoy it just the same today. Its a very light funny movie guaranteed to make anyone laugh. The situations with each one of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I particularly liked the one with the girl traveling with her mother's ashes (who ends up picking them up on the highway after the explosion)   the robbers and the nuns. This nice humour style is much missed these days. Also  this movie proved that actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty/Days of our Lives) was off to a great start. I recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video shop.,positive
A notorious big budget flop when released. This Robert Altman inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast. Although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely  there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end. If you are a fan of character actors and actresses  this will be a treat for you; you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie (you may not know their names  but you know their faces)  heck even the kid from A Christmas Story turns up in a small part. Rent if from Netflix  if you read this  I bet you will enjoy it.,positive
In the early '80s  I recorded Honky Tonk Freeway from the cable. Since then I have waited  hoping it would be on DVD. Yesterday I found it. It is one of the best humorous character studies I ever saw. The Old Fashioned episode is priceless. At this time (4/28/02) only two have reviewed it. One hated it  the other loved it. If you have a DVD player  either rent it  or buy it as I did.,positive
"VERY memorable comedy. It's fun to watch the many situations develop and finally converge after a long journey on that greatest collection of eclectic humanity (and the world's largest honky-tonk) - the great American Freeway. Like ...mad, mad world it's got loads of contemporary talent  old-boy politics  good comedic action and dialog. Unlike that one it is the target that seeks  not the unwitting seekers - they have no idea what they really want as they drift along America's great road. Nor does it carry the weight of having a great fall guy who is saved only in the end by a great belly-laugh. But the ending stunt sequence is nothing short of spectacular with excellent film editing  humor and timing  and the big city bank scene is hilarious with very original acting by one very talented character in particular. The total aplomb of the city dwellers in the face of chaos leaves one feeling like the proverbial fly on the ceiling. The slapstick is funny  but Honky Tonk Freeway deserves to be heard and seen closely because it is surprisingly loaded with nuance and character reactions that are easily missed. All in all a very funny reflection of who we were and are  good or bad  and the goofy situations we find ourselves in. It was just meant to be FUNNY and it is!",positive
This movie bombed at the box office and in the voting here but I loved it. One measure of a movie's worth is how much of it you can still remember after 25 years. I won't bore you with a list but there are dozens of deeply comic scenes  also a good story and great casting. The inept robbers are a hoot. See it and judge if it ever gets on TCM.,positive
This is an interesting  hard to find movie from the early 70's starring Jan Michael Vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine. Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home  the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine 'Raider'. Gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion  and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence  stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway. Vincent's character  whose name is Marion  takes Gere's outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine 'Raider'. Marion hitch-hikes his way into Wyoming and stops at a little Norman Rockwell-like little town. In the local café he meets Rose Hudkins  who immediately catches his eye. Staying with Hudkins parents  Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine 'Raider' could still be so innocent. The story also brings up the Japanese Internment Camps  as the towns folks go 'hunting' 3 escapees. Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. But there's still a happy ending  which befuddled me a bit. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway  this captures JMV at the peak of his 70's performances. BUSTER AND BILLIE  BABY BLUE MARINE and WHITE LINE FEVER in the mid-70's were amazingly good JMV performances. He was both an action star and a heart-throb all at the same time!!! He made a lot of quality movies during his career  and continued to do so up into the mid 80's with the great TV show Airwolf. He does a very good job in this as 'Hedge'  quietly observing the way people treat him (in his uniform) as he travels across the country. He must have performed some of the stunt work as well- there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie-and it looks like he's the guy getting tossed down the river to me! But really  at the height of his popularity  this movie could have done so much more with JMV's talent and his looks. Innocence can only be so interesting. Evil  as explored in Buster and Billie  is much more dramatic! Anyway  Glynnis O'Connor is delightful as Rose. The whole look of the movie is like a Norman Rockwell painting. The outdoor scenes are gorgeous - must have been filmed in Canada.,positive
I first saw this film in 1980 and it touched a cord which reminded me of a more innocent time. The opening narrative  music and paintings by Norman Rockwell set the tone for me. You either love the movie or hate it. Jan Michael Vincent was at his all time best and portrayed Cpl Marion Hedgepeth in a most innocent and touching way. This movie is at the top of my all time favorites  a shame it isn't available on DVD or VHS anymore. The ending was also wonderful. John Hancock did a marvelous job of capturing the essence of the time.,positive
"I am an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched this for the first time on DVD -- the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that it was rated G. How did they get bedroom scenes  a seduction story line  two strip tease acts  and war/shooting/blood into a G rating? Weird. I would rate it PG-13.<br /><br />Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The acting was great. The storyline was a little weak  leaving gaps that could have been filled with some good dialogue. There were too many no talking, just walking scenes for me... I would have liked to see the the relationship between Julie and Rock blossom  so that the intense love would be more believable.",positive
**SPOILERS** Beautifully photographed slice of life home-front WWII love story with Norman Rockwell paintings in the beginning and end of the movie about how a war hero is not just someone who kills for his country but is also someone who thinks for himself and isn't corrupted by the war propaganda that's constantly drummed into his head. Washing out of the Marine Corps Marion Hedg Hedgepeth  Jan Michael-Vincent is kicked out of boot-camp  after five weeks  and forced to put on a Baby Blue Marine uniform that shows that he just didn't have it to make the Corps. Humilitated and scorned wherever he went as he's going home to St. Louis and terrified what his family  whom his dad was in the Marine Corps in WWI  would think of him in that he couldn't Cut the Mustard as a US Marine. <br /><br />Hedg stopping in a bar and finds sitting next to him is a Marine member of the fearless and deadly Marine Raiders Richard Gere whom a admiring Hedge buys a beer. Making conversation with Richard Hedge is shocked to find out that not only is he being sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the battles he fought in  and combat medals he got  but the totally gray hair and mid-thirty looking Richard is going to be 21 next month! That's what being in the Marine Corps and WWII did to him! Buying Hedge a number of drinks Richard takes the drunk Baby Blue outside and knocks him out taking his Baby Blues and leaves his impressive US Marine uniform with some money in it for Hedge to ware. <br /><br />As soon as Hedge puts on Richard's uniform  that fits him perfectly  he's confronted by this big drunken US paratrooper who calls himself Cement-Head wanting to have a fist fight with the Marine Raider. Hedge doing everything he can to avoid trouble is forced by Cement-Head to belt him  after he himself cracked two beer bottle over his cement-head  to get himself warmed up for the big bout between Marine Hedge  and Paratrooper  Cement-Head. Hedge incredibly floors the big cement headed buffoon knocking him out cold with one punch! I guess the trick is not hitting him in on top of his head a stunned Hedge tell his  Cement-Heads  fellow G.I's.<br /><br />Hitch-hiking to this small town of Bidwell Hedge notices this US Military internment camp for Japanese-Americans who are there because their considered a threat to US security. It's later in the movie that Hedge shows everyone what a real hero he is  not who the people in the town think he is  by risking his life to save one of the hated Japs who mindlessly together with two of his friends escaped from the interment camp  where the hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge risked his life by saving the scared to death Japanese-American from drowning in the dangerous rapids outside the town. Hedge in his actions taught the people of Bidwell that not all Japs  even those who are American citizens  are bad and treacherous banzai screaming suicidal kamikazes like they were thought by the newspapers magazines and movies at the time to think that they were.<br /><br />Hedge strikes up a conversation with the very cute and pretty waitress at the local diner Rose Hudkins  Glynnis O'Connor who's just crazy about him that even Hedge at first thinks that it's his uniform not him that impressed her. Later when Hedge admits to Rose that he's not what she and her parents think A US Marine Raider that he is Rose had by then gotten to know the sweet and caring washed-out marine so well that it didn't matter to her at all what he was supposed to be  a Marine a Paratrooper or a Post Office worker  it was what was inside his heart that really counted.<br /><br />The film has a number of touching and beautiful scenes in it between Hedge and Rose that shows how movies used to be made years ago without all the sex and profanity that we see and hear in movies today that involved two people in love with each other.<br /><br />The way the film accurately  not phony baloney  shows the true feelings of average Americans  back then in 1943  about the war in general and Japanese in particular couldn't have been done in more authentic and accurate as well as good taste. Baby Blur Marine does it's best not to be too politically correct in not showing the hero's or leading actors and actresses in the film having the same feelings and ideas back then during WWII as most people have now  which would have come across as phony as a three dollar bill  to those people watching the film who lived during those historic and momentous times when the film was to take place.,positive
I was actually around 13 years old camping near the McCloud River  near Shasta when this movie was being filmed. My family was paid to leave our campsite for the afternoon  when they filmed Vincent floating down the river. A little trivia...the scene where they pulled him out  was actually where he started his float down the river. And if the stunt man missed the netting  there was 20 foot waterfall about 1/4 mile down farther.<br /><br />Anyway...I watched it at the time  and didn't get it. It wasn't until years later when I saw the movie and actually understood the meaning of it. It's pretty powerful movie and certainly a fine job by Jan at such a young age. His movie career never really took off as expected  but of course he later found success on TV. I wish this movie was available  cause I would love to see it again.,positive
Just saw Baby Blue Marine again after 30 years. I still find it a pleasant and romantic film which catches a time which has been lost forever. The innocence and purity of a time now long gone  is truthfully captured in this small film. The acting is above average and Richard Gere's brief appearance as a shell-shocked Raider Marine war hero  holds a keen interest for any film buff or Gere fan. Jan-Micheal Vincent is in his prime and looks and acts like the All-American boy. The late Bruno Kirby (who was billed as B.Kirby  Jr.) has a meaty role as Pop  a peace-loving  Marine Corp reject  dreaming of getting back home to his wife. If you're looking for sex  drugs  or rock and roll  this movie is not for you. If you're looking for action and adventure  the same applies. However  if you want to recapture a time in America of innocence  honor  romance  and love  then Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you.,positive
I first viewed this movie when it first came out and also bought an LP recording of the soundtrack. I liked it so well  I went back to see it several times..cannot understand why it was considered a flop. Julie Andrews was lovely in this film  her voice was in top form and the costuming was beautiful!<br /><br />The film contains a little bit of everything and even though some of the scenes were a bit heavy-handed  they were still fun. <br /><br />I recently found I could get a copy in DVD form and ordered it......I was disappointed that a couple of songs and sequences in the movie were not included in the version of the DVD I ordered.,positive
Cheezy? Yep. Poorly filmed? You betcha. Zero budget? They proudly claim it on their posters. Brilliant anyway (or because of it)? For sure.<br /><br />This movie celebrates (and makes fun of) everything that was classic about the 80s teen horror genre: Characters with absolutely no depth  fitting into a stereotyped roll they never escape for a moment; teenagers trying to survive a slaying by some mysterious force they disturbed by doing something lamely adolescent; completely gratuitous nudity; impossible amounts of blood coming out of victims; slow moving zombies; great one-liners... and our hero even wears a Michael Jackson jacket! <br /><br />This is not an all-out spoof like Scary Movie  but more a tribute film to the lost innocence of the 80s horror movies... when being scared and grossed out could also be a fun  silly  sexy  and goofy good time!,positive
OK  so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers  but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted  right? Right! Consider yourselves officially warned  and read on...<br /><br />In this parody/tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980's - a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious Murder McGee  who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard. As I'm sure you can guess  things go from bad to worse faster than you can say Where's the beef?? and in typical 80's horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody  the dialogue is cheesy  and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get. Good times...<br /><br />No clique or 80's horror movie clichéd characterizations are left unrepresented here. In fact  no stone was left unturned at all  we have the cool hero  his innocent girlfriend  the Goth chick  the tough thug (think John Bender)  the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt  the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt  a couple of gorgeous half-naked lesbians  and two big geeks.<br /><br />As you can plainly see  the cast is pretty big. Usually  larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly  with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel. Not in this case though. Not a single cast member left me disappointed. The acting was very well done. Everyone from the cool hero in his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith to the grooovy Goth chick played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One & Two played by Cory Assink & Jonathan Brett  they all played it straight  brought their A-game  and knocked it out of the park. If you're a fan of Gary & Wyatt in Weird Science  you'll immediately fall in love with the geeks.<br /><br />Director/co-writer Jeff C. Smith is a guy to watch for in the future  trust me on this. If this is what he can do with a low budget  there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects. The characters were dead on; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughs were huge; the blood flowed  and squirted  and sprayed beautifully  it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980's. Call this one THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets NIGHT OF THE DEMONS!!! The tag line says it all  and says it honestly - EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE; GRATUITOUS NUDITY; ZERO BUDGET - no false advertising here  folks! As fans of this genre  we have to look to the indies and support these hard-working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales  lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered-down PG-13 'horror' or pointless remakes like The Hitcher. No  thank you - no more of that for me.<br /><br />In closing  I honestly have to say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE! is by far one of the best indie flicks I've gotten the pleasure of watching this year. It's a bloody good time  and holds up on repeat viewings. From the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe...even the closing love theme over the end credits (which if that doesn't bring back fits of laughter recalling mid-80's power ballads by REO Speedwagon - over-pronounced R's on every word starting with the letter 'R' - then I'll eat my DVD right now)...bottom line is  if you're a fan of 80's horror or horror in general  no more hesitation - this flick deserves to be in your collection!!,positive
Loved this movie! Kicking it old school! Love the idea. Love the script. Love the characters. I really really really loved the Geeks! I was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored. This was right up with my favs such as Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium. If you are a big fan of scary AND silly then this is your movie! Only taken off one star because I would love to have had better sound. Not bad sound but would have liked to have more. Great blood splatters. Great murder weapons. Great costumes! I really love the nod to the great 80's teenager stereotype ala breakfast club. And I can appreciate the non-CGI suspense. Really good camera action and light suspense instead of cutting to CGI. I would rather have good fake that really fake fake.<br /><br />Kisses to the cast and makers! oh  loved the making-of too!,positive
STMD! is one of the most fun and enjoyable low-budget films I've seen in quite some time. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-writer  cinematographer and editor) definitely shows his love of under-appreciated 80's horror films with this movie! Anyone who loves the cheesiness  preposterous situations  wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies will definitely love this very tongue-in-cheek homage to the past.<br /><br />STMD! definitely lives up to the qualities described in the poster and then some. It has all the excessive violence and gratuitous nudity that is reminiscent of those entertaining 80's horror movies we all love. I had a blast watching STMD! From the 80's outfits that the stereotypical characters wear to the blood splatter to the goofy tone I just couldn't get enough!,positive
It's the 1980's and the teenagers are ready to party it up in a scary old house that is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of Murder McGee. After mistakenly conjuring the dead through an unfinished conversation on an Ouija board  the kids are forced to fight to the death battling a vengeful ghost who possesses and kills all of their friends one by one. Sound familiar? It's supposed to. It's clearly marketed to pay homage to the classic 80's slashers with the tagline: Excessive violence. Gratuitous nudity. Zero budget. <br /><br />Can't get enough; It's pure entertainment! I enjoyed the humor and the way it poked fun at all the horror cliché's  but at the same time embraced what was fun about movies from this time. There is something you get with this movie you never got with the old 80's slasher films though: good acting. The entire cast was very talented and you don't see that very much in any low budget flicks  recent or otherwise. There was a lot of chemistry between the characters. I was very entertained throughout the entire film  and I am fully convinced the writer/director and cast will go a long way in their separate careers. The script was very well written  and the dialogue flowed naturally.<br /><br />The effects were a bit amateur and the scenes were not lit well  but the fact that this movie admits on its cover there was practically NO BUDGET  I already know this going in. This film makes it simple to politely ignore its faults and just sit back and enjoy. Although this is not an Oscar award winning opus  it never claims to be  and props to that. It's a lot of fun. If you like slashers  you'll really appreciate this film. If you like blood and boobies  you'll appreciate it also.,positive
This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible  Sarah`s law  following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne . In fact it`s scheduling was delayed while Phil Collins took legal advice after he found out he`d been fooled by the show`s maker Chris Morris into a starting a campaign entitled Nonce-sense<br /><br />If truth be told this show is probably more remembered for the controversy than the content which is in very poor taste but I do confess that I laughed out loud . The edition centres around paedophiles and how society treats both them and their victims . Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile . Cue the child`s frightened screams . Like I said very poor taste <br /><br />Other highlights of the show include Dr Fox giving a scientific lecture that paedophiles share an identical nervous system to crabs (  No one knows this but it`s a scientific fact  ) Labour MP Barbara Follet giving a public warning about equipment paedophiles put on their genitals while surfing the net and Kate Thornton warning viewers that paedophiles can send gas through the internet which makes young children suseptable to sexual predators including one victim  Who was once a shy innocent child and who now has the sexuality of a sixty year old Colonel  . Morris also shows a police officer in the child protection squad a serious of photos wanting to know if they`re classed as obscene . The photos included Barbie surrounded by a marital aids and a composite photo featuring a young boys head   a dog`s body and an erect penis that could only have belonged to John Holmes . Hey I never said this show was tasteful did I ? <br /><br />It`s impossible to mention PAEDO-GEDDON without the hypocritical fall out that surrounded it where politicians   childrens organizations and policemen rushed to condemn the show for making fun of a very serious subject . The show was poor taste despite me laughing all the way through it but it`s a biting satire . Perhaps the critics should take a long hard look in the mirror where a liberal elite allows convicted paedophile slime to walk around the streets of Britain before they criticise a mere TV show for exacerbating tensions .,positive
Who ever put that review as 'of bad taste' is not all quite there... its so funny  genius and fantastic you could watch it until your eyes are square! not to mention the rest of the work he has done on the rest of the series...all is as good as Morris' standards. if you think that it is 'awful'  'distasteful' or 'sick' then i can only think of one thing to say to you: go to hell. thanks. it had to be said! i think that the way that so many people complaining was a complete joke...i would like to make a shout out to all the people that actually did that: haven't you got anything better to do with your time? what are you trying to prove? thanks for reading my heart-filled review on the matter...cheers,positive
Chris Morris' Brass Eye TV series had always generated a large number of complaints  both from the audience and from the people taking part. But  nothing he has done has managed to stir up more controversy than this. The 2001 Brass Eye Special. Before the hugely overrated Jerry Springer Opera arrived  the Brass Eye Special held the record for the most complaints received about any TV program ever aired.<br /><br />The sheer volume of complaints that the general public made towards the Brass Eye Special was unbelievable! Many complaints were voiced by people who never even watched the program! The subject that the program handled turned many heads  but the message was widely misinterpreted. The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. This was not a show that mocked the subject of paedophilia. The show was purely about the media and it's presentation of the subject. Morris  is and always will be  a media satirist. The notion that the program 'makes fun' of paedophiles and children who have been abused is completely laughable! Morris never attempts to do either such thing. He merely draws our attention to the overwhelming  and very often stupid media hype surrounding the subject.<br /><br />Using many of his established 'Brass Eye' characters  such as  Ted Maul and others  Morris shows just how much the media over blow every little thing about a subject that they themselves created and built up  and the result is as funny  if not funnier  than anything Morris has done previously. Using his tried and tested formula  Morris manages to trick several gullible celebrities into believing that they are working on a serious documentary. In actuality  they are made to look like exactly what they are. Retards.<br /><br />All in all  the Brass Eye Special needs to be seen to be believed. And  with one opening line  Morris manages to sum up the entire media situation as it stood in 2001: Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!,positive
"the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic  as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such 'taboo' subjects  such as paedophilia. the newsdesk set  the suits  the smug presenters  the men-at-the-scene shouting about things you can see behind them  the pointless cgi graphs and stats  the whole thing was a satire  a very very funny satire. the way c-list celebrity's will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them it'll be good for their career (there is no evidence for it, but it is scientific fact). It may be hard to watch (with milly dowler and the cambridgeshire girls  as well as 9/11)  but satire is supposed to be challenging  and we shouldn't be afraid to stand up against the blatant scaremongering and headline grabbing media  just because it's a delicate matter. How this show failed to win any TV awards for it's intelligence  observation  courage  acting and thought provocation is shameful  but  as watching it will show you  not in the least bit surprising.",positive
"Ida Lupino is trapped in her own home by crazy Robert Ryan in Beware, My Lovely, a 1952 film from RKO. Lupino and Ryan did three films together and worked well as a team  both being consummate professionals and strong performers. In this film  based on a Broadway play called The Man, Lupino is a World War I widow who rents out a room in her home. She's very active and well-liked in her community and though her husband has been dead for two years  she's not ready to move on. The man who rents her room goes on vacation  and Lupino hires Robert Ryan to help her with some heavy-duty cleaning in the house. He's friendly enough to start  but later terrorizes her  locking her in the house  and not allowing her to answer the phone or the door  as he grows violent and more out of touch with reality.<br /><br />The character played by Ryan is shown in the beginning of the movie running away when he discovers a dead body in another house he's working in. It isn't clear whether or not he's the killer  since he seems surprised to see the body. He might be a split personality  as when his personality turns ugly toward Lupino  he seems to have no memory of his activities when he comes out of it. He doesn't know that he has the keys to Lupino's house in his pocket and doesn't know why he has tickets to a party that he bought from young children who came to the door.<br /><br />Beware, My Lovely, is a very suspenseful film  and the two leads give terrific performances. The tension builds to a very high level and ends in a way you're not expecting.",positive
This Blake Edwards film isn't too sure whether it wants to be a comedy  a drama or a musical. No matter  the sheer presence of Julie Andrews  is reason enough to see this comedy-drama-musical-spy spoof. Julie is beautiful and uses her many talents  throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired  but he's is more than fine  as Julie's romantic interest. Authentic World War I cars and planes  add to the appeal. Overall  the film is very entertaining. The DVD release is an edited (by Blake Edwards) version of the original release. Supposedly  this is the only version that Edwards would allow; but  Turner Classic Movies has shown the complete (theatrical release) version  recently. Recommended.,positive
Beware  My Lovely came on TV on BBC2 recently during the early hours so I set the video to record it and was pleased I did.<br /><br />A man finds a dead woman so he escapes so he don't get the blame for her murder and gets a job as a handyman at a widow's house but she does not know what she is taking on here. It turns out this man is a psychopath and possible killer. He starts tormenting her and locks her in the cellar. He then cuts the phones line so she can't get help from the outside. A young boy who regularly does shopping for her notices something isn't quite right when he comes to drop her shopping off. Eventually  the man leaves  acting as if nothing has happened.<br /><br />I can see why Beware  My Lovely was given an X certificate when released in the cinemas. Some of the scenes are rather nasty for this time. I also thought the man was going to do something to the young boy too.<br /><br />The cast features an excellent performance from Robert Ryan as the psychopath  Ida Lupino as the widow and are joined by Barbara Whiting and Dee Pollock as the boy.<br /><br />This is certainly Robert Ryan's most chilling performance I've seen. A must see.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars out of 5.,positive
A terrific B-feature. A virtual two-hander and set over the course of a day  (you can see it's stage origins and even how it must have worked as a radio play)  and although only 77 minutes long  played out in sequences akin to something like real time. Robert Ryan is the psychopath who keeps Ida Lupino trapped in her own home. Both are superb  especially the under-rated Lupino whose initial independence and self-control soon crumble before Ryan's unhinged intruder. Today  of course  it would be all guts and gore but the restraint shown by director Harry Horner  (much better known as an Art Director)  only adds to the suspense which at times is worthy of Hitchcock.,positive
I particularly enjoyed Delly's review of this film and agree that Howard is not the only damaged character. Howard is rather ruthlessly set-up by the script  but there is no evidence that his previous employer is actually dead or  if she is  that he murdered her. Howard doesn't know and neither do we. In terror and confusion at seeing the woman lying there  he bolts. However  he never actually harms Helen Gordon  no matter how enraged he is. Indeed  he reacts with horror at Helen's fainting spell and the fact that he is holding a pair of scissors...then he resumes his tidying up and greets the recovered Helen with the almost pathetic  I'm very tired now. I think I'll go home. Frankly  I don't think he's a psychopath. A sick puppy  certainly  but not a psychopath.<br /><br />The problem with Howard is that he has no real male identity. He wanted to serve his country  but his mental condition denies him a place in the army. He is singularly rootless and isolated: no wife  no girl  no home (again  at least as far as we know). And  he does a woman's job - Floor's are my speciality. Helen's niece ruthlessly strips away this pride in his thoroughness by exclaiming caustically that she would want a man with a real job. Also  although he finds himself strongly attracted to Helen  he is unable or unwilling to do more than scare her by making a strong sexual pass. He is remarkably powerless - can't fight  can't work  can't make love.<br /><br />Helen is justifiably terrified  however. She tries to connect to him but  finding that he doesn't respond normally (i.e. way outside the comfort zone provided by her rose-tinted memories of husband Ned)  unwittingly presses all Howard's buttons by lying to him in her attempt to escape.<br /><br />Both characters  trapped in the house  trapped by fear  neuroses  rage and memory  deserve sympathy. I know the sudden ending has disappointed some reviewers  but I felt it fitted well  as it offered a kind of release to the characters. Helen is freed  I think  from the past. When Howard tries on her husband's army coat  Helen's disgusted reaction is highlighted. She no doubt feels that the sacredness of Ned's possessions has been violated but  hopefully  her need to keep everything untouched has been lost in the reality of her own struggle with danger. Perhaps she can move on.<br /><br />Howard is also freed - from his endless cycle of anger  hurt and violence. Whether he moves on to treatment or to jail is debatable  but I hope it's the former.<br /><br />Great performances from Ryan and Lupino. I prefer On Dangerous Ground  but this is pretty good too.,positive
The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier whom Lupino hires as handyman. She is a war widow.<br /><br />The set is limited but the acting makes up for this. Robert Ryan is conflicted: one moment he seems nice  then confused about where he lives. At first Lupino tries to help him. He seems troubled but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? The suspense builds. I truly enjoy films like this  which rely on the human element for suspense. What is this man capable of?. There are some scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying grocery boy who sees something is wrong. We keep thinking she will be helped  then Ryan's personality turns again. He becomes like a Jekyll/Hyde character and eventually chases Lupino with a knife.<br /><br />Worth watching for these two superb actors. 9/10.,positive
Beware My Lovely originated from a play written by Mel Dinelli who apparently liked writing about frightened women. His first and best effort was the screenplay for The Spiral Staircase. He also did a Loretta Young suspense thriller Cause For Alarm a couple of years earlier. The play Dinelli wrote was originally entitled The Man and it ran for 92 performances on Broadway during the 1950 season. It was Dinelli's only effort on Broadway and it starred Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. <br /><br />The roles that Gish and Boone played are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For whatever reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference. Dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen so I'm wondering what he thought about that. Certainly the frailty issue was eliminated completely from the story.<br /><br />That wasn't the only thing that was eliminated. The people are all wearing period clothing from around World War I yet there's no reference at all to the time this story takes place in. I thought that strange and later on when the telephone company repairman comes to Ida Lupino's residence  I noticed his truck was a vintage one of the same era.<br /><br />The film is almost entirely set within Ida Lupino's home where she's hired an itinerant stranger in Robert Ryan as a handyman. The film is a great object lesson in not hiring strangers without reference. It turns out that Ryan is a schizophrenic who imprisons Lupino in her home for about a day.<br /><br />Both the leads do fine jobs even with the changes made. Films like Beware My Lovely are the stuff that a small studio like RKO did best. If this were done at MGM or Paramount the glossy trappings would have overwhelmed a solid story.,positive
We are in a small town  a homely widow (Ida Lupino) hires a handyman (Robert Ryan) to look after her house. She soon starts to regret it as Ryan grows erratic by the hour  it appears that she is host to a dangerous schizophrenic  and now she is unable to escape her house.<br /><br />Beware  My Lovely is adapted from Mel Dinelli's {The Spiral Staircase} story and play called The Man. Pretty much a one set movie and a two character driven piece  the film boasts two great central performances and offers up an interesting take on mental illness. One however shouldn't be fooled into thinking this is a violent and nerve shredding picture  because it isn't. It's clear from the get go that Ryan's Howard Wilton is a dangerously troubled man  but this is a different sort of peril movie. One that throws up another slant on psychosis and thus makes it difficult to hate our dangerous protagonist.<br /><br />Ryan and Lupino are a great combination  they had also done the excellent  and far better  On Dangerous Ground this same year. So with both actors clearly comfortable together  it brings out a finely tuned character story all based in the confines of one house  re: prison. Ryan is particularly strong as his character flits in and out of madness  with some scenes powerful and at times inducing fear and at others garnering deep sympathy. The direction from Harry Horner is safe {he in truth doesn't have to do much other than let his actors run with it} and George E. Diskant's cinematography contains some smart and impacting visual touches. With one involving Christmas tree baubles immensely memorable. Falling some where in between being average and great  Beware  My Lovely has enough about it to make it a recommendation to fans of borderline and easy to follow Film-Noir. For fans of Robert Ryan tho  it's something of an essential viewing  oh yes  and then some. 7/10,positive
When I first saw this film it was about 1956 and even though I saw it again recently I have not changed my mind about it. I think it was Robert Ryans best film  because he portrayed someone like my father  and he was a schizophrenic in real life (my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse. Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt. (My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man  it was a very good imitation of this type of individual  and I was impressed.,positive
The movie with its single set  minimal cast  and straightforward photography (except for a couple of brief special effects) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during TV's early years. Nonetheless  the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow Ida Lupino as she tries to deal with her semi-psychotic handyman Robert Ryan before one of his mood-swings kills her. And who better to play the troubled part than that great actor Ryan. He wasn't very versatile-- watching him essay comedy is almost painful. But no one was better at wounded idealism (On Dangerous Ground) or the psychic pain of this movie. Few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure.<br /><br />Lupino's problem is that she's locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next. The suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape. It's a nail-biter all the way. This is not one of Lupino's many fine soulful parts that she was so good at. Instead  it's a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough. My favorite scene is with Ryan and bratty teenager Margaret Whiting. Ryan's already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him. Then when Whiting walks in and finds the attractive-looking Ryan scrubbing the floor  she starts getting coy  flirting with her budding sexuality. Sensing trouble  Ryan abruptly fends her off-- finesse is not his strong suit. Insulted  Whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work women's work. That does it. Up to that point he's been courteous and professional with Lupino  trying to set himself on a normal path. But Whiting has hit his raw nerve. Now there's heck to pay as Whiting bounces out the door  leaving Lupino to pay the price. It's a riveting scene  expertly done.<br /><br />Anyway  this is one of the dozen or so films produced by Lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little black-and-whites in favor of wide-screen spectacles. Too bad. What a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera and in front. She deserves at least an honorary Oscar from a movie industry to which she contributed so much.,positive
Whenever Ida Lupino appeared or directed a film in the 30's 40's and 50's  you were guaranteed great entertainment even if the picture was black and white. Ida was able to capture audiences and keep them spellbound until the very end of her pictures. In this film as Mrs. Helen Gordon High Sierra '41 along with Robert Ryan (Howard Wilton) Golden Gloves '40 she keeps you guessing just how the relationship is going to turn out and just how poor Mrs. Gordon will be able to have a normal and happy marriage with love and real affection. If you liked Ida Lupino  who could play the roles as a criminal in a woman's prison and prison warden who was hated  this is the film for you to enjoy. I truly believe that Ida Lupino was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the Movie Industry!!!,positive
I was fortunate enough to see this movie on pre-release last night and  though I wasn't expecting to  actually really enjoyed the movie for the most part. The rescues and sea effects were amazing to watch and definitely provided edge of the seat tense moments  probably all the more so knowing that there are guys who do this for a living. The weaker parts of the movie revolve largely around using stereotypical set scenes. I'm not going to spoil the movie but this really follows along the lines of An Officer and a Gentleman and those moments give it a little bit of a cheesy aftertaste.<br /><br />Like I said over all this movie is pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get past the clichés.,positive
I can see that the ratings for this film aren't all that high for this film  so I must be in the minority for liking this film so much. Well  I am right and everyone else is wrong (just kidding). I guess I like it because I am a psychology teacher and I really liked the brooding character played by Ryan. While he truly is dangerous as well as VERY menacing  you can't exactly hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and probably suffering from some sort of brain trauma. And wow did Ryan do a really good job portraying this man! You really find yourself feeling for Ida Lupino as he destroys her life. So with such intense acting and menace  why is the movie rated relatively low? Well  probably because it isn't exactly believable ...but boy is it entertaining and creative. Give it a try and don't believe the score of 6.4--it's a lot better than that!,positive
Intense domestic suspense with the mistress of the house (Lupino  excellent as always) threatened by a psychotic migrant housecleaner (Ryan). The 2 masters of the genre are at their heady  erotic best as they match wits  emotions  and wills in a bizarre hostage situation right out of the Saturday Evening Post. Richly hued B & W photography with an unusual amount of close-up head shots. The young girl who teases Ryan is really well directed here. Improbable  but satisfying suburban melodrama.,positive
Beware  My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man  Harry Horner  better known for his set designs. Robert Ryan plays a handyman who is hired by Ida Lupino to do some housework for her. The problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doesn't know it. Miss Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win Ryan over  to little avail. He is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure. Thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well  but one of them can't do well because there is something wrong with him. He suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence  which he later forgets. <br /><br />Essentially the effect Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and his prey  or in another sense a sadist. The audience finds out early on that Ryan is a mad killer  but it takes Lupino much longer. Thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor Miss Lupino try everything in her power to 'win' Ryan over in order to make things work  get the job done  get on with life. But getting on with things isn't in Ryan's makeup  as he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality  and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself. <br /><br />As a study in mental illness the movie isn't too impressive. What it's superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness  with dangerous psychopathology in the mix  and its effect on a normal person. In this regard the film is realistic and compassionate  though relentlessly logical in that we know Lupino can't 'fix' Ryan  yet we want her to. The result is that  if one is willing  one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside  so to speak  its melodramatic structure.<br /><br />Horner shows us  gradually  the layout the Lupino house   a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We become familiar with staircase  kitchen and pantry; and we come to know which windows Miss Lupino can use for an escape and which ones she can't.,positive
I first saw this as a kid (THE LITTLE RASCALS first went on TV the year I was born) and fairly recently bought this on DVD. In between  I watched it on the occasions it was on and took careful notes at 1) the pie fight itself and 2) how racist some of these parts were: Farina as a Nubian slave  doing voodoo  for example. I think Roach and McGowan would have been beaten to death if they'd tried to do that now.<br /><br />Notice how the pie fights in The Three Stooges' HALFWITS' HOLIDAY and IN THE SWEET PIE AND PIE resemble this one...and this film came out a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. There was obviously some inspiration from SS and Laurel & Hardy's THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY for these films...remember  at that time  they all stole from the best  each other!!! <br /><br />One more note: Laurel & Hardy buffs  that bake sale lady was none other than Dorothy Coburn  who also appeared in TBOTC-the 'flapper' getting into her car and getting it in the rear end. It always escapes me why she was never credited?,positive
Shivering Shakespeare could be considered the first classic of the Our Gang talkie era. By now  Hal Roach Studios began to hit their stride in making talking pictures  and Shakespeare is the happy result.<br /><br />The Gang is appearing in a version of Quo Vadis produced by Kennedy the Cop's wife. The kids don't find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theatre and cannot remember their lines. Among the funniest bits are Kennedy the Cop as the giant  who pulls off his makeup to fight an overzealous man in a bull costume; and the terrible dancing girl (played by director Bob McGowan's daughter.)<br /><br />Several filmographies mention that Shakespeare has the first pie fight in a talkie. This may be true  seeing as they tried different speeds with the film during the fight. Buster Keaton's brother Harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies. Very funny and an early Gang talkie classic. 9 out of 10.,positive
I swear if I did ever tried cocaine I'd be able to relate to this film perfectly. Its pace  as well as the dialog  churns out at speeds that some viewers might need to stop and relax their heads.<br /><br />There are great little elements that pop up through out the film  like how Rob Lowe's character seems to always be loosing a shoe  or how some characters keep running spirals around his zigzagged path. The story was put together extremely well and the direction seems flawless.<br /><br />The movie reeks of clumsy and cuteness. This is one I think most could enjoy. A few laugh-out-loud-even-if-you-are-alone moments ensure that I'll certainly be watching this again.,positive
This one is a hilarious diamond in the rough. The acting and plot aren't that impressive  but the lines just keep on coming. This catches a lot of flack because it seems at first glance like  well  a bad movie  but it's so kooky that you can't help but be amused. The spastic lightening quick dialog and quirky characters keep it going... I was especially fond of Sharon  the Canuck on Shrooms eh? However  the one that really stole the show was Richard's little brother Andrew (Ira Heiden)  his high pitched whining was somehow endearing. The whole movie rocked.,positive
This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. This  in my opinion  is Rob Lowe at his best. I'm not quite sure why this film has gotten such a low rating. I guess you either love it or hate it  but if nothing else  it is definitely worth a rental.,positive
This seemed to be a lackluster film to me that betrays a low budget with poor cinematography and not all that great of a job of editing. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during the World War II era  but I recommend that all others beware. Many of the scenes in this film were flat and some of the actors were a bit weak. The story about the men getting called back to duty during a short leave seems realistic enough  but there's no real pacing or tension in the story. I also had a tough time understanding what the actors were saying  partially due to some strong English accents and perhaps some due to an inferior job of sound recording. I give this a 55/100. Most folks will want to steer clear.,positive
<br /><br />***************************MILD SPOILERS AHEAD**************************<br /><br />We Dive at Dawn is an English made movie with John Mills in the lead role. The second time I watched the DVD version was on a big screen TV and I must say the movie is better than I thought the first time I saw it on the samll screen. May be it was the big screen viewing that helped?<br /><br />I still say the first few segments of the movie are muddled  but once the submarine leaves the dock and begins its mission  the movie takes off too! The search for the German battleship named the Brandenburg and the adventures which went along with it were absorbing and the detail shown in the movie are interesting!<br /><br />I'm increasing my rating to 7/10. If you enjoy WW II films  I think you'll find this one interesting once the submarine gets underway. Some of the men on the sub have quite a sense of humor  too!,positive
"Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this movie / musical. The opening song by Ms. Andrews  Whistling Away the Dark, will always be in the back roads of my mind. The plot line during World War I  is great and suspenseful one. If you are a romantic  you will love this movie. This is a movie that I always enjoy to see again and again.",positive
i found the story to be just enough of a thriller that the wonderful henry mancici music didn't lull me. julie andrews was excellant and i sure don't understand why this movie had problems at the box office when it came out because it just makes me happy at the end to have everybody singing. and i do like happy ever after endings which i think you can say this movie has along with some traditional blake edwards humor...,positive
If you're in the middle of a ferocious war and it's still not clear that you're going to come out on top  among the things you'll be concerned with is to keep up the morale of the civilians...to demonstrate that our troops have the bravery  the resourcefulness and the dedication to overcome all the odds in a noble cause. And that's just what director Anthony Asquith provided the British with 1943's naval war film  We Dive at Dawn. After more than 60 years  it's not surprising that some of the movie is dated. It doesn't help that the class stereotypes which help define the enlisted men from the officers can be jarring. Here  as in so many other British war films  the men invariably have thick regional working class accents while the officers speak with an educated fluency that would place them at home in England's finest ruling-class establishments. In this movie  Freddie Taylor (John Mills)  the captain of the submarine Sea Tiger  is clever  confident  resourceful  aggressive  in control  good with his men  humorous with his peers  quick to make a decision. And it helps that he's lucky. His men are jolly tars  for the most part  competent at their jobs and always ready with a joke when things get tense. Although we spend the first third of the movie getting to know these people while they're on leave  after that things get tense quickly. <br /><br />Taylor and his sub are ordered to destroy the Brandenburg  a new German battleship. They just miss the ship when it enters the Kiel Canal and heads into the Baltic. Taylor assesses the risks and decides the Sea Tiger will go after it  through mine fields  anti-sub nets and with a real risk of not having enough fuel to return to home base. After several tense situations  the confrontation takes place. The Sea Tiger lets loose six torpedoes but has to dive  not knowing if it had done its job. After a clever subterfuge  Taylor outfoxes a couple of German destroyers but then realizes there is not enough fuel. He plans to scuttle his sub and surrender when  just at the last moment  James Hobson (Eric Portman)  a seaman who had been sullen and a loner and who speaks German  says there is a small Danish coastal village that had been a fuel depot. He thinks it might still be for the Germans. The last third of the movie is a rousing action sequence as the crew of the sub attempts to hold off the Germans long enough to pump in enough fuel to get the Sea Tiger back to Britain. This is a wartime propaganda movie  so don't expect failure. And did the Sea Tiger actually put the Brandenburg down? Are the men reunited with their wives and sweethearts? Did Hobson have a reconciliation with his wife and small son that left him smiling for once? Did Freddie Taylor finally have a chance to make use of all those female names in his little black book? You'll have to see the movie. <br /><br />There are propaganda war movies and there are propaganda war movies. Some  like Powell's and Pressburger's One of Our Aircraft Is Missing and The 49th Parallel  still stand up to viewing today because the stories are solid and unexpected and the creators didn't use obvious shorthand clichés. Others  like We Dive at Dawn  were made with enough clichés that when watching we have to remind ourselves how dire the time was when the film was made. Still  Asquith can build a lot of suspense even with a few clichés. The Sea Tiger's forcing its way through a sub net was tense. The stalking of the Brandenburg and the plotting needed for the torpedo firing was realistic; John Mill's no-nonsense attitude while he prepared to attack was well-handled. The fake-out preparations to make the Sea Tiger look as if it had been destroyed by depth charges was as realistic  inside the sub as well as out  as you could hope for  and the battle for the fuel depot was dramatic and exciting. We Dive at Dawn is not a classic war film  but it's a well-made  well-acted example of its type and time. <br /><br />John Mills  it's worth noting  had a long  long career. Especially in the Fifties he played in a number of serious-minded films looking back at those WWII days. He had the quality of showing grit  cheerfulness and perseverance  but of also being trustworthy  a man England could be proud of as he fought the war. Top-billed in this movie was Eric Portman  a fine actor with a unique voice and the ability to give stares so cold you'd want to put on a sweater. Everyone on the sub is very much in the joking but stiff-upper-lip mode  but Portman manages some complexity for his character. Mills and Portman did fine jobs working together on this film.,positive
This is an excellent tub-thumper from the war years.<br /><br />John Mills leads a fine cast of regular British B-movie stalwarts in a solo submarine attack upon a fictitious enemy battleship.<br /><br />Filmed in black and white  it's well paced and also well placed considering that a war was going on at the time. If anything  it shows how seriously the authorities took positive propaganda.<br /><br />The mission-side of the movie takes place in genuine submarines. Things are cramped and claustrophobic. The actors look suitably grimy and sweaty without being too offensive to the heroic palate. Other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic little details like keeping the vessel trim and forgetting to read instruments  as well as the engine-room activities.<br /><br />This probably is the first movie in which debris (and a dead German) is blown from the torpedo tube to fool an enemy destroyer. And it's the ONLY time I have seen part of the vessel exposed in a pretence of sinking - a high risk gamble if ever there was one.<br /><br />I'm a little sceptical as to whether or not a submarine could punch its way through a wire-rope net. Submerged speed was barely twice that of human walking speed  and the net would have had a great deal of 'give'. Also  the engineer was at the same work-station and operating the same levers both on the surface and submerged. This  too  seems implausible as either diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship - or so I'm told.<br /><br />There was a wee bit too much shore-side drama for my tastes. But then  this was a propaganda effort  and clearly contained a subtle message for civilians to mind their behaviour as it could adversely affect service morale and therefor the war effort.<br /><br />These niggles aside  it's a pretty entertaining little adventure. Nowadays movies of such vintage tend to be screened in the afternoon  whilst far more modern and inferior movies enjoy prime-time. But then; it's no longer politically-correct to mention the war in the presence of our European friends (Too many of them have guilty consciences)  or our own left-wing fascists (non of whom have ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted).<br /><br />As a submarine movie it is eminently collectible. Better than 'The Enemy Below'  I think  though less demonstrative. Not so authentic as 'Das Boot' by any means  but not so gross either.,positive
Any film about WWII made during WWII by a British production company has no latter-day peer in my opinion  respectfully. The confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in At Dawn We Dive: as a descendant of Admiral Horatio Nelson and student of all aspects of World War Two and particularly naval warfare  I favor depictions of subs and action in the North Atlantic and especially those which include the German side of things. For those unacquainted with target priorities  an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. The pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the Ealing  Rank and British-Gaumont studios back in the day: frankly I prefer its quieter  more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over-produced Hollywood movie ever could. This reminds me of Powell and Pressburger's The 49th Parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive Eric Portman  a favorite of mine. John Mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles  so this is clearly meant to be Mr. Portman's film but the whole cast shines. As for the title sequence  am I the only one who is utterly charmed by Gainsborough Production's lovely pre-CGI Gainsborough Girl?,positive
The submarine used was NOT Varangian! 'It' was in fact two boats  P614 and P615  both built for Turkey by Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness but kept hold of by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk but P614 was eventually delivered in 1945. <br /><br />The confusion no doubt arose because someone looked up P61 (as I did) and found Varangian! When in fact  the last digit of both P614 and P615 was in fact just painted out....<br /><br />There are some extremely realistic moments in the film. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S-class. As no S-class submarines survive  the shots of them (as P61) and of the depot ship Forth form part of an interesting record now  as well as an excellent film.,positive
This movie is all about reality  submarine warfare in WW2 was not a clean precise science. There were no computers giving exact enemy details  there was no precise instrumentation to 100% control the sub. Not all the crew went to fight with a song in their heart  and a smile on their dial.<br /><br />People with expectations of seeing a pretty war in this movie will be grossly disappointed  .............. GOOD  they deserve to be disappointed  they deserve to have reality shoved into their face.<br /><br />War is not clean  exact  fought by people about to break into song. It is endured by scared  cold/burnt  hungry  desperate people willing to do anything to survive.<br /><br />We Dive at Dawn is a fine example portraying a desperate situation needing desperate actions.,positive
As a teenager  I watched this movie every time it was on TV (and it was on a LOT) because of its witty  appealing-to-teenager humor. It may not be what critics consider 4 star viewing  but I love it for what it is--a fun comedy meant to please the audience. The teen actors are of my generation (probably why I love the movie so much) and was like a fantasy cast of everyone's favorite TV shows of the early 90's--Full House  Family Matters  Fresh Prince--all of the shows were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90's. Though it may not include the high doses of nudity and violence that so many teen movie writers think vital to success among the youth demographic (or perhaps because of its absence)  I highly recommend it to pre-teens and teenagers everywhere.,positive
I think this movie is my favorite movie. I am not sure why  but it is. Julia Duffy has been my favorite actress for awhile  and when I saw this  I went crazy. It's sort of romantic  and I definitely recommend this movie.,positive
This was a excellent back when it came out. It had some the best talent available and a funny story. Between Candace Cameron and Tatyana Ali  it was hard to choose who is cuter  and add in Carlton from Fresh Prince and all the other big names  and you get a blockbuster. Ok  a made for TV blockbuster  but none the less. If you can find this move  don't miss it.<br /><br />,positive
Glenn Ford is hired by a crooked bank owner and wily stable owner Edger Buchanan to stage a fake robbery while the banker hides the real loot. With Ford a no-show  the two instead go with a trigger happy second choice  leaving Ford on the hook for killings he didn't commit.<br /><br />Columbia Pictures' first color feature  The Desperadoes looks fantastic with sets and costumes fabricated to take full advantage of the Technicolor process accentuating tons of well staged western spectacle.<br /><br />This has the irresistible teaming of a young Glenn Ford (third-billed but essentially the star) and a prime Randolph Scott leading an incredible supporting cast of great character actors in colorful roles  including scene-stealer Edger Buchanan as a good-natured but mildly villainous yokel who isn't as dumb as he looks and who has quite a few memorable lines.<br /><br />A fairly complex script effectively mixes incredible action sequences  melodrama  and comedy  well directed by Charles Vidor. This is one of the great westerns of the nineteen-forties and highly recommended.,positive
This is simply a good ole fashioned western..not overly complex or long. It doesn't deceive itself in thinking that it was made but for entertainment. Still  it is one of those westerns you can watch once and be done with without returning. It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford's Cheyenne Rogers has been part of bank robbing(he even steals Scott's Sheriff Steve Upton's horse without knowing it his good friend for which he is thieving). In Red valley  Upton is under heavy scrutiny for a bank robbing that ended with several dead. Claire Trvor portrays Countess Maletta  a friend of Cheyenne's who gives he and buddy Nitro(Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams)a place to stay for the time being. Cheyenne desires to go straight  but finds that hard when Jack Lester(Bernard Nedell)and his bad bunch want to rob Red Valley's bank. It is actually Jack who is behind the murders  but Cheyenne's troubled past is hard to get away from. He and Nitro will be charged with the murders they didn't commit(the robbery was one Cheyenne didn't commit)and it will be Upton who must somehow save the day before Lester gets away with murder. There are sub-plots which include Cheyenne's falling in love with Alison McLeod{Evelyn Keyes;the irony of the story is that Alison's father  Uncle Willie  is actually in cahoots with Banker Stanley Clanton(Porter Hall)in a planned united theft with Lester to steal the town of Red Valley's loot}. Will Upton uncover Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton's treacherous scheme? Will Uncle Willie be able to go through it without his conscience always bothering him? This film has a terrific barroom brawl and a dandy of a climactic shootout. Columbia couldn't have picked a better genre to begin the coloring process as this film has some fine mountainous shots as men give chase on horseback and such. Don't expect to get your socks blown off  but the film is simple and well paced.,positive
i liked this western Starring Randolph Scoot and Glenn Ford.it's got pretty much everything a western should have.there's gunfights action chases on horseback.there's a bit of a romance angle that's hinted at.there's some nice comic relief in the form of Edgar Buchanan who plays Uncle Willie McLeod a character who pretend to be a doddering old fool but is actually aware of everything going on.Randolph Scott plays the town Sheriff and Glenn Ford Plays Cheyenne Rogers/Bill Smith a hunted outlaw who eventually tries to change his ways.i liked the different mix of characters in the movie.i didn't find it always fast paced but i never found it boring either.even though the movie is in 1943 it is in colour. 8/10,positive
Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford were once outlaw pals together  but now Scott's a sheriff and young Ford is still hiring his gun out. He gets hired to pull a bank job  but is delayed getting to town and those that hired him get someone else. That leads to all kinds of complications  a lot for a film that's not even 90 minutes long.<br /><br />Randy and Glenn both got girls here. Claire Trevor plays her usual good time gal with a heart of gold. And Evelyn Keyes is the daughter of Edgar Buchanan who falls for Ford big time without realizing who he is or why he came to the town that Scott is the sheriff in.<br /><br />It's B western  but unusual for the time and for Columbia Pictures it was given the full technicolor treatment. The Desperadoes marked Glenn Ford's first film in technicolor  a process reserved only for some of the more expensive films from bigger studios. Harry Cohn was certainly not one to shell out for it. And definitely not during war time.<br /><br />The plot gets a bit convoluted as both Ford and Scott are put to the test of friendship versus expediency/duty. The plot also involves some high class hypocritical skunks in Randy's town who are the real outlaws as far as the film is concerned.<br /><br />The four leads do a fine job and the best supporting performance is Guinn Williams as Ford's lovable explosive lunkhead of a sidekick. The climax involves a cattle stampede and a shootout in the town saloon and is one of the best ever done in a western film.<br /><br />Fans of the four leads and westerns in general will enjoy this one.,positive
Probably because this is Columbia's first film in color  the colors look different specially in the indoor scenes. They seem to be stronger  sharper and the result is a bit unrealistic  but very pleasing. Randolph Scott is the sheriff  a good guy but the real star of the movie is a very young Glenn Ford  who is an outlaw that wants to change. Evelyn Keyes is the woman that starts falling for Ford and Claire Trevor is the Countess that runs the saloon. There is a funny character called Nitro that does not think twice before blowing it. I particularly enjoyed two moments of the film  one when there is a tremendous horse stampede and you see thousands of horses  there was no computer to help at that time  so I presume they must have gathered all those horses  no easy task. Another moment is the final shootout  technically very good. There is also quite a fistfight. Seeing this western made in 1943 with such great action scenes  makes you come to a sad conclusion: They don't make them anymore. Would they be able to in case they wanted? I have my doubts.,positive
The Desperadoes (1943) is a genuine classic  not for its story (which is fairly routine)  but for its technical production elements. This was a landmark western  the biggest ever at the time of its release and all the more unique because it was a Columbia production-a lightweight studio with a bottom feeding reputation. Only Fox's Jesse James (also starring Randolph Scott) from a few years earlier gave anywhere near this lavish a treatment to the genre. Although it would be eclipsed in a few years by The Searchers and High Noon  The Desperadoes was a ground breaking effort and a historical treasure. <br /><br />In 1863  the economy in the town of Red Valley  Utah is based on rounding up and selling wild horses to the Union Army. The script gets a little messed up here with references to the railroad (which was several years away in Utah's future) and Custer's Last Stand (Custer was busy fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time) but these are not important plot elements. <br /><br />Red Valley has an honest sheriff  Steve Upton (Scott)  but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; robbing their own bank each time the government pays for a herd of horses. The town is visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford)  a famous outlaw who is an old friend Steve's. He wants to go straight  especially after falling for the pretty livery stable owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyenne's partner Nitro Rankin (Guinn Big Boy Williams) is mainly there for comic relief as are Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and the town judge (Raymond Walburn who models his character on Frank Morgan's Wizard of Oz crystal ball faker). <br /><br />Taking no chances with their huge budget Columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element but Indians and covered wagons. There is the best wild horse stampede ever filmed  a spectacular barroom brawl  an explosive climax  romance  and three-strip Technicolor. All this stuff doesn't necessarily fit together but who would have cared back in 1943. Unity is a problem as it tries to be both a serious action western and a comedy. <br /><br />The cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of its filming. The indoor scenes are solid but it is the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences. <br /><br />Scott and Claire Trevor were top billed  but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford  who would soon be their biggest star. And Director Charles Vidor utilized the film to showcase his new wife Keyes (whose portrayal of Scarlett's sister in Gone With the Wind had connected with audiences more than any small part in the history of films). <br /><br />The Ford-Keyes dynamic is The Desperadoes most unique and important feature. Rather than go for the cliché love triangle with Scott and/or Trevor (which it first appears will happen)  the entire romantic focus is on the two younger actors. This was probably the best role Keyes ever got and she makes the most of it. Playing a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks great in both leather pants and dresses  and who rides and fights like Kiera Knightley's character in Pirates of the Caribbean. This was revolutionary at the time and coincided with the 1942 formation of the WAAC for WWII military service. <br /><br />The Desperadoes is one film that has been well taken care of and the print looks like it is brand new. Unfortunately there are no special features on the DVD. <br /><br />Then again  what do I know? I'm only a child.,positive
This movie was very good. I really enjoyed it. Tom McCamus' performance was excellent and very believable as the consumptive son Edmund. I also enjoyed the set design (house) and the costumes.,positive
This is a great movie. The best role Peter Strauss ever did. The music is good  the message harsh  the actors great and the story is both emotional and raw. Only in the seventies did they make them like this one!,positive
I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature. Finally!!!!! It's about time Hollywood got their act together. The big Studios always frown at edgy material  with Oscar written all over it. Go figure!!<br /><br />JERICHO MILE was made ahead of it's time. It's a masterpiece.<br /><br />Michael Mann  a true visionary  found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence. Peter Strauss' Emmy award performance is probably the best character role I've seen in my film-viewing lifetime. Any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless an Academy Award is already sitting on their mantle).<br /><br />The gritty multi ethnic ensemble  a backdrop for THE JERICHO MILE makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world. This is about redemption without public validation  and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers. Imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole  that doesn't know he is possibly the fastest runner in the world. ...what would you do??<br /><br />This movie makes you walk away feeling you haven't been cheated on any level. Totally thrilling  engaging  emotional  and a Rolling Stones soundtrack that kick's ass!!!<br /><br />I always thought this would be made for the big screen... Can't wait...!!! In the meantime I'll have to continue re-watching my weathered VHS copy I've had for many years.,positive
The first time I saw this film I was a kid. I was ten years old when it was released but since my family never went to movie theaters I saw it on Network TV. I remember watching it aloneand crying afterward. It was only the second film to illicit that response (Rocky was the first) and there haven't been many since. I can't say why exactly; Larry Rain Murphy didn't deserve to win any more that Rocky Balboa or anyone else. I know I admired Murphy  not so much for what he did  but for the way he did his time. Stoic. He didn't need a stopwatch or freedom to find dignity. He ran because he could. He needed no other reason. I have a rule today  that when I see this film late at night on cable television (the only time most will come across it) I must watch  no matter what I have to do the next morning. Fortunately it doesn't play often like Shawshank Redemption or other favorites  so I still get plenty of sleep and I never tire of the story of one man's unrepentant imprisonment and personal victory.,positive
This movie is certainly well-constructed  beginning and ending in the dark  with focus on Lili Smith /Schmidt  Julie Andrews initially the singing 'angel' later the notorious spy.<br /><br />It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it again recently. While it was dismissed by critics in the 70's as overblown  'cinema vulgaris'  and lacking in structure (among others) time has proven them wrong. Blake Edwards certainly has produced a film that is almost of lyrical quality.<br /><br />The film soars and swirls (aerial photography; Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates. One must just buy into the premise that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong. Overlooking the tepid chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson  one must believe that these are lovers - who in all innocence fall for each other. And in the end  love is far more important than winning wars. And so is maintaining innocence.<br /><br />There is a lot of understated acting  and the film certainly reaches emotional depths often not seen in comedies.<br /><br />There are wonderful comedic elements (foreshadowing the French goons in Victor/Victoria)  interesting diplomatic asides (reminding me of The Tamarind Seed  seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of good-will.<br /><br />Suspend all disbelief and this movie will carry you away. Julie Andrews' belting out of war songs and the haunting 'Whistling Away the Dark' are reason enough to turn the TV on  just for the soundtrack. And the striptease number  like the 'Jenny' number in Star! works. <br /><br />This film has  like a good champagne  aged well. Paramount should bring it to DVD as soon as possible. The same applies to transferring the laser disk of Star! to DVD. These are both interesting pieces of Julie Andrews' meticulous and then underrated works.,positive
A film that deserved theatrical release. This made-for-television movie is a cinematic gem that exemplifies the technique of Michael Mann with stirring contemporary music tightly integrated to the visual images. Always with Mr. Mann  the amplification of impact by the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy-award-winning actor added to the ensemble of cast  writer  director and cinematographer.<br /><br />This film is definitely one of my all time favorites. While nothing is perfect  this film comes very  very close.<br /><br />Along with an excellent script  great direction and masterful acting by Richard Strauss  there is an all-star ensemble of character actors at their finest: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize the names  but you will recognize every face.<br /><br />If this comes on TV  sit down with popcorn  turn up the sound for an amazing soundtrack and score  and prepare to be riveted for the 97 minutes of the film. I highly recommend recording it  since it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and the DVD is region 2 encoded.,positive
i love watching the Jericho mile. i mean watching peter Strauss run the mile is like watching usain bolt sprint the 100 meter. i think peter Strauss is a excellent actor and should do another running movie. he is lightning fast has great energy and can run a mile in under 4 minutes and that my friend is amazing. no man alive can out race rain Murphy i mean the man runs 80 mile a week no one does that but him. i've watched the Jericho mile 100's of times and will watch it 100's more. great movies get watched more than movies that are not. i thank the makers of this film for giving years of there lives to make it.they are great people and i bless them all.thank you for letting me get my word out again thank you all.,positive
Peter Strauss  by nature of appearing in mini-series and made-for-TV films  often gets an unfairly high proportion of bad reviews - Usually from casual observers who saw ten minutes of the film  having channel-hopped into it half-way through. Well  I've just read all the other 20 reviews for this film and am delighted to see not a single bad word said about The Jericho Mile - That should be enough to have you blasting out to buy this film!!<br /><br />Peter Strauss won an Emmy for his role in this film and watching it even once will show you why he deserved it so much.... <br /><br />Looking to be objective  I attempted to criticise this film. Instead  I found myself arguing down every one of my possible nit-picks. This is what true  realistic film-making is about. This is not your typical Hollywood sensationalism  where everything is overacted - It's so realistic and true to life that people have thought it's based on a real event!!,positive
I really enjoyed this movie - I like prison movies in general (I'm not sure why -- I'm sure some shrink could make something out of it!) I spent one night in jail more than 20 years ago  and I knew then I would never go back - I got the individual version of scared straight! (I did get locked up in an isolation cell on Alcatraz for a couple of hours  compliments of a park ranger  but that's another story!) Anyway  the genre really interests me. The soundtrack  specifically Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones  was the perfect backdrop for the film. To this day  I think of The Jericho Mile every time I hear the song.,positive
An interesting and involved film about a lifer just trying to live out his days peacefully. Elements of the main character appear in Michael Mann's later films  like Thief (1981)  Heat (1995)  and so on. You can see this one at the UCLA Instructional Media Laboratory-- one of the only places in the country that has copies readily available to the public. It's a great one!,positive
I've never given a movie a ten out of ten before but this is the closest I have ever come (I gave it a 9). There are very few movies that I truly love  this however is one of them. With it's gritty realism  fantastic on-site locationing  and it's great soundtrack it literally blew my young mind when I first saw it in 1979. At that point I didn't know about prisons  violence  racial tensions  or the struggle to survive & live free. I doubt that anyone who is an adult  or for that matter anyone who is growing up in todays world could be impacted by this film in the same way I was all those years ago  but I will say this: if you haven't seen this movie I envy you; this is because you have the chance to see this great film for the frist time. For each of us they're different  but here's to the rarest movies of them all: the ones we actually love...,positive
I watched the this the other night on a local station because I didn't feel like watching tripe like 'American Idol'. Peter Strauss gives a great performance as a convict named 'Rain' Murphy who keeps to himself. He admits to his crime and makes no bones that he feels no shame for it. His cell is bare of any comforts that other inmates have like books and pictures. The only time he feels in another zone is in running. He does it often and can run a mile in under four minutes. When a college coach hears about this  he wants to prime him for a shot at the Olympics. At first  'Rain' wants no part of this  but when his best friend is killed  he shows interest.<br /><br />This is a good movie  period. Strauss is very good (What did you expect  anything less?) and Michael Mann shows hints of greatness that would come full bloom years later. This movie had that bit of realism (probably because it was filmed among convicts). It almost feels like this was a true story. The additional casting is good. There is a lot of notable names like Brian Dennehy  Roger E. Mosley  and Richard Moll as well.<br /><br />My heart sank when some pompous board of directors wouldn't let him run because he didn't feel bad for his crime. His final act made me stand up and cheer. When they took his dreams away  he took them back hard. This was back when TV movies were actually good. 'The Jericho Mile' is a gem of a film. ESPN Classic  PLEASE SHOW THIS FILM!!!,positive
I watch a lot of movies - DVD  features  and classics  you name it. The night I watched JERICHO MILE  my wife (who had ordered it on the internet) said she remembered it from when she was in high school  that it had stayed with her all of these years. Somewhat reluctantly I sat down (with our daughter & son)  and was riveted from the opening sequence to the end titles. We all were. <br /><br />She  who remembered the original  and our kids (18 and 16) who had no idea what the movie was about couldn't believe it. Our favorite scene? Bar none  when peter Strauss so passionately bangs his fist down and says  i'd do it AGAIN!. It didn't advocate violence because it was a defense crime  but evoked such intensity we couldn't believe it...when his fellow cell mates gave him their food in support of his efforts  there wasn't a dry eye in our house.<br /><br />Someone please make more movies like this one. UNBELIEVABLE!!,positive
The film is not for everyone. Some might think the acting is bad when it is actually understated and natural. There are no obviously evil acts and there are no stunningly beautiful moments. There is a lot of indecision  an lot of conflicting feelings.<br /><br />Actually this film takes a very honest look at a very complex subject  Sex with minors. It is complex because the characters are trying to deal with love and sex when her body and hormones are still developing and both of their minds and personalities are still developing. Complex also because society has very simplistic views of sex with minors  and complex  because the characters don't know if society is right or if their instincts are right.<br /><br />Some will not like the movie because it leaves unanswered questions. Questions such as who was really in charge of the relationship  who was damaged  did good come out of it  was it art  who was damaged more  did some of the problems with their relationship stem from it being forbidden by society  did some of the problems stem from their own immaturity  and probably most important  was this truly a crime?<br /><br />The film is resolutely neutral on all of this  and it is this neutrality that is its strength. It is the reason for the understated acting  the simple sets  the lack of background music  soft lighting  and the general flat presentation. The message is clear. We don't really understand this kind of relationship today  and quick judgments are bound to be shallow.,positive
Jennifer Montgomery's Art for Teachers of Children is a stunning  disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking  raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifer's seduction of her married boarding-school guidance counselor. The scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery) on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen captured on film. The lesson ultimately learned here? There's nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art. Well  I would highly recommend this remarkable piece of Art for anyone interested in thought-provoking independent cinema.,positive
To summerize this movie: nice for TV but too small for the theatre. I enjoyed watching this movie at home but I wont watch it a second time. The concept is good  but what ends up in the movie is just a summary. The end had a 'nice' twist but is still unsatisfying. Maybe it was the intention of the director but it wasn't worked out like a it should be. But then again  it's an OK kind of movie.,positive
I always loved this film. The music story and the action. I especially love the opening and closing of the film. The music stayed with me throughout the years. The WWI plane battles were great and the comedy is typical Blake Edwards. Slaptick is his forte' after all. Julie's singing is amazing and keeps me glued to the screen. The sets and the scenes are wonderful. The characters are appealing. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie's singing to them. I wish she sang to me in Vietnam. I also enjoyed the old cars from the period and the WWI music.I was glad when the DVD arrived. Now I can whistle in the dark watching it again and again.,positive
If you enjoy riddles and suspense  you will enjoy this movie. Truth be told it was mostly the Adrian Paul part that got me to pick it up  I knew almost nothing about the movie beforehand. Plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope)  a student of philosophy and metaphysics  starts playing a mysterious riddle game trying to figure out the reason and gets involved in the game by solving riddles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner  also a riddle fanatic  and also gets entangled in the game. Myth has it that if you solve the game  the meaning of existence (referred to as The Design) is revealed. Brendan Fehr's character is a village idiot type hanging around the shop who turns out to be more than he seems. All in all  I thought the movie was pretty well done. And it's definitely an original concept  a rare find these days! I personally happen to like riddles and puns  so while most of them weren't very difficult  it was still a fun movie. Well worth the rental.<br /><br /> So  if you haven't seen it -- get it! :-D<br /><br />,positive
This is a cult classic for sure!!<br /><br />It is tricky to follow at times  but then again  so is a film like Jacobs Ladder or even say Fight Club. If you want standard fare  then i figure go rent the Care Bears Movie or perhaps an old Disney classic. But if you want  to view the world differently then i would say open yourself up to Enigma's and for that matter to a film that challenges what we see and think.<br /><br />For me the key is that the film was original and had me questioning throughout. So while i have seen some complaints  all in all i would say take the film for what it is and enjoy.,positive
I watched this film not knowing anything about it. I had presumed it was a sci-fi b movie of some sort. How wrong I was. The plot is enthralling and intelligent  the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change. Some of the riddles stumped me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple. I am quite baffled at the low scoring of this film as I thought it was quite unusual. If you liked the film Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix then you will like this. There is no major special effects or fancy gimmickry here at all. It is all about the plot  about building the characters and building an atmosphere. It is a film however than ultimately provides no answers which may irk some people but I thought the ending was great. I am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not.......,positive
Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark   mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman ( Vern and Sarah )   each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past . Fine dialogue and first-rate casting propel this low key  noirish journey into the girl's search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life. Aided by her   anything but enthusiastic  male friend  the two of them reach the end of their quest   but with a price to be paid. The film never intends to answer all of its mysteries   but does an excellent job in the exposition of several plot twists,positive
I have seen many many movies and this just totally blew my mind. The trauma  the suspense is just amazing. I ended so wound up in the psychological fear and Philosophy of it  and relating it to reality. Movies that play and challenge your mind are movies you don't forget  those that make you doubt your reality. A problem could be the quality  but that doesn't bring down the essence of the movie.<br /><br />The idea it self is brilliant and the ending leaves you just completely shocked and with the question for you to seek the answer. I just totally loved it! So many clues and twitches and puzzles. One of the best movies ever  hands down.,positive
this film was probably the best scary film i've seen in years. chilling might be a more accurate description. the ending was unexpected and therefore took me by surprise. if it has any flaw it would be the overuse of the whole meaning of life concept. since noone truly knows that answer  you definitely sail into murky waters when you incorporate that concept into a movie. put that aside and the movie is quite enjoyable. carly pope should emerge as one of the next bright young stars in the film industry. the rest of the cast were somewhat shaky  however since the focus was on sara novak (carly pope)  her performance anchored the movie. the  at times poor acting abilities of her costars were not an issue since it was not their performances that fuelled this movie. (thankfully). watch this movie you should enjoy it.<br /><br />t,positive
What can I say? Not as bad as many here have made it out to be. The only reason I even watched this film that I had previously never heard of before  was strictly for IAN McSHANE.<br /><br />I was not disappointed in the least. IAN McSHANE was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role. He's always great to watch and for my money... an extremely underused actor.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film.... Every other actor in the movie delivered strong  solid performances. These people certainly weren't being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation (as this was a fairly low budget film) but this did not mean that any of them mailed their appearances in. Everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them.<br /><br />I was even pleasantly surprised at ADRIAN PAUL's performance though I must admit I have only ever seen him in the HIGHLANDER Television series before this movie.<br /><br />The plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life  not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film. Anybody who expected a clear-cut  by-the-numbers  connect the dots conclusion or answer at the end of the movie... CLEARLY wasn't watching the film closely enough! This film is not going to tell you what the meaning of life is! The idea is that after seeing the film  you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee. I certainly did.<br /><br />No car chases... No explosions... No bar room brawls.... (sounds pretty dull  huh?) But the reality is that I was completely absorbed by the film and it's just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved.<br /><br />****** WARNING...****** If you're the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous question as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly...<br /><br />YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY THIS FILM.,positive
A raw edgy thriller that aimed for great philosophical heights it couldn't quite attain. I did still enjoy the film immensely. It had great elements of suspense  leaving me with that delightful spine chill I expect from thrillers  and it achieved this purely psychologically  without resorting to escalating blood and gore. The soundtrack and setting added to the suspense perfectly. At times  it was a bit unpolished  particularly the acting  and character development. It could only have been a better film if we had known more about the nightmares from the past the characters see when they close their eyes  and why they felt this desperate need to seek the answer that is so integral to the storyline. After all they seemed to continue to seek it  despite knowing or at least having an inkling of what might happen when they found it. I would recommend seeing this film if you are prepared to look beyond the grit to see the potential of a diamond in the rough.,positive
I saw the movie while I was in a class a few years back in high school. I thought it was a thought provoking movie that made you want to look into the power behind riddles. I think the type of people that wouldn't like this movie would be those who don't like solving things  or those who get frustrated when they can't solve riddles. its a good movie  based on a true story that happened in my home town of Toronto  Ontario. so if u want a real record of the things that happen in the alleys there  watch this movie. And for those who only watch movies to point out plot holes and character flaws  realize that in real life  this same stuff does happen. but thats all I want to say on that. The riddles are good  some are hard  some are not. But the movie also leaves you wanting more  more riddles  more explanation  just plainly  more. Something more I want to add  is that the ideas within this movie  the underground riddle world  does exist  but there is a lot more to it. To find it  you can not look for it. To never look for it  would be no way to find it. Leave your mark  and it will find you.,positive
"Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this isn't bad! In fact it's quite entertaining. Actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae.<br /><br />To break Julie's goody two shoes mold she plays a German Spy/English Musical Hall Actress. She subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie S.O.B. and play a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby Blake Edward's direction.<br /><br />The movie is admittedly problematic It is hard to feel for her character because she's a German Spy. We want to love Julie but she's on the wrong side of the law. Probably this is why this movie flopped. Julie as a German Spy? Our Mary Poppins? our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German Spy?<br /><br />The romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere. But never mind  it's a musical and it has Jullie. Oh and did I mention hunky Rock Hudson is in it too?<br /><br />Julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss. Great WW 1 Songs and nice tunes by Mancini.<br /><br />Yes the film has plot holes and at times doesn't seem logical. For example  why is Julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the Germans when a minute ago she was spying for them. <br /><br />But on another note  who cares? The musical numbers are fun and exciting. The costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish. The cinematography quite on the mark.<br /><br />It has the annoying idiot detectives that Blake Edwards puts in all his movies. (Yawn)<br /><br />But it has Julie- trying desperately to change her image. (You can imagine dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie: Blake we need to change my image. <br /><br />Blake: I Will make you a German Spy, then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie. They won't recognize you. It will be the death of Maria Von Trapp<br /><br />Fascinating study on changing an image. Wonderful Julie. A must see for musical comedy buffs. Much more entertaining than Star!",positive
It could be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you don't have to throw cartloads of money at a movie to make it good  nor will it guarantee that it is worth watching) but I think that is totally missing the point. If your expecting fast cars  T&A or a movie that will spell itself out for you then don't watch this  you'll be disappointed and dumbfounded.<br /><br />This movie was thoroughly enjoyable  kept us on the edge of our seats and made us really think. The writer obviously put a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it shows through the end  just remember to keep an open mind.<br /><br />Note: the school scenes were all filmed at McMaster University and most of the rest was done in Toronto.,positive
Nemesis Game is a mind-bending film filled with riddles  death  mystery  and philosophy. In it's simplest sense the film is about seeking answers and what happens when you've finally found them all. The search for answers leads Sarah Novak down a path that gets darker as it gets more compelling. The final answer seems more dangerous than it is worth  yet Sarah is so close to understanding it all. What would you do if you were offered the ability to finally make sense of the chaos of life?<br /><br />The movie was written and directed by Jesse Warn. While this was Warn's first feature length film  the movie doesn't reflect that at all  but instead shows polish and an artistic approach to telling the story. Carly Pope was powerful in the lead role and showed a depth of complexity that was fascinating to watch. I would definitely love to see more of her work.<br /><br />Being based on riddles  this is a very cerebral movie. It's that's your thing  as it is mine  then I totally recommend seeing Nemesis Game. Rating: 4.5/5,positive
Yes  I am a romantic of sorts who likes musicals and comedy and this fit the bill! Julie Andrews gives a mesmerizing performance at the beginning and end of this film with the Whistling in the Dark production number. The sedate-to-outrageous number that she performs in the middle of the story when she believes that Rock Hudson has been seeing a dancing/call girl is eye-popping and will certainly make you giggle.<br /><br />I only wish that this film could be found in video or DVD as I would surely purchase it in a heartbeat for my home library!,positive
As a late-going patron of the drive-in thearers (1970's-1980s)  there are many movies that I have seen & forgotten. This is one I could never forget. Despite its low-budget  exploitation-style of movie-making  the STORY was very well done. The isolated therapy-asylum  where patients act out their fantasies in order to help cure their phsycosis  the accidental murder of the head doctor just as the new nurse arrives on the scene  the (supposed) assistant doctor taking over  the various crazy paitents  the revelation that the assistant doctor is actually a patient herself  and  finally  the rescue of the young nurse by the simple-minded Sam  who killed everyone else in the house so she could escape unharmed  made for a great STORY  which held the film together. I emphasised the word STORY because that's what makes a good or great film. No matter how much blood  gore  nudity  sexual matter  or outrageous behaviour you put in a film  if the STORY is not good  then the film is not good. The film credits show clips of all the actors  including the old hag with the final line telling you to get out & never come back  which is a great ending to this film. If it is out on video/DVD  see it & enjoy it.,positive
Sweet young nurse Charlotte Beale (a charming performance by ravishing redhead knockout Rosie Holotik) goes to work at a remote rural asylum run by Dr. Geraldine S. Masters (the excellent Annabelle Weenick). Among the motley assortment of colorfully crazed patients are insatiable  aggressive nymphomaniac Allyson King (the luscious Betty Chandler)  loopy Judge Oliver W. Cameron (a gloriously hammy Gene Ross)  paranoid Vietnam veteran Sergeant Jaffee (nicely played by Hugh Feagin)  gentle giant Sam (the amiable William Bill McGhee)  and nutty old hag Mrs. Callingham (the supremely irritating Rhea MacAdams). Said patients are dangerously encouraged to act out their fantasies by Dr. Masters  which of course results in a rash of brutal killings. Director S.F. Brownrigg  working from a clever and suitably overwrought script by Tim Pope  does an expert job of creating and sustaining a suffocatingly dank and brooding atmosphere of seething madness and oppressive claustrophobia. Robert Farrar's spooky score  the grimy set design  a few wild grisly murders  Bruce B. Alcott's grungy no-frills cinematography  plenty of deliciously robust  scenery-scarfing histrionics from a game no-name cast (Ross in particular is a total eye-rolling hoot)  and the genuinely shocking surprise bloodbath conclusion further add to the overall infectiously seedy fun of this choice trashy chunk of 70's low-budget regional horror exploitation cinema.,positive
This film  also known as don't look in the basement is actually not bad. It is a little known film even to die hard horror fans but I found this movie pretty entertaining. Don't get me wrong  it's certainly not without its problems but do think more people should give it a look. The story of a hot nurse going to work in a sanitarium is certainly an appealing one to me. I thought the acting   which seemed forced at first  somehow got better as the film went along. It seems like the actors really got into their roles. There are some good  colorful characters  including a guy who thinks he's still a soldier  one who thinks he's a judge  an adult with a child's brain  and an attractive girl who craves attention so bad she drops her clothes when any man gets near her. The title don't look in the basement has about as much relevance to the story as the last house on the left has on that film. If you like movies with creepy characters in a mental ward like I do  check this out.,positive
Don't Look in the basement is actually a very clever and well thought out exploitation flick that gets a bad rap because of its cheap quality and bad acting. Sure  it's not a masterpiece by anyone's standards but it is a very fun little B-film with a lot to offer and even a lot of creepy scenes that will stay in your head.<br /><br />As I said  the acting could have been a lot better but that's the case with most exploitation so I can't really complain. The story is clever and has some great plot twists that will keep you guessing. I thought the gore was a lot of fun too. There's just something great about older gore films because they didn't have CGI back then so they had to actually set it all up themselves. See this one for a good time!,positive
I just discovered this obscure '70s horror movie while browsing on YouTube. For a low-budget effort  it has plenty of compelling moments in gradual pacing in leading to the surprisingly shocking finish. While there is one woman who takes off her shirt constantly  the fact that she's a nymphomaniac makes those scenes important to the story and there's one scene with the curly-haired young man as he attempts to seduce her that turned me on before his pulling back made her screaming mad. The young nurse who comes in and gets hired is alluring herself and I'm not surprised she posed for the cover of Playboy. Some characters are very irritating and some scenes do seem ridiculous. For the most part  however  Don't Look in the Basement (That's the title I saw on YouTube) provides enough drama and chills for an entertaining B-movie.,positive
Clearly my rating for this is not to suggest it compares with the classy horrors of the likes of Argento but with other 70s low budget  drive in fare and in that department it truly is a classic. The lack of money shows  (Does anyone care too much?) the acting is adequate rather than professional  (Does that make it more realistic?) but unlike so many other movies  and not just low budget ones  this does not drag for a moment. Crap it may be but non stop crap  in your face crap and although inevitably a bit campy at times  this is a must see for anyone who has any idea what I'm talking about. At times quite delirious  this crazy little film filled out with crazy characters is clearly made for fun and fun indeed it is to watch.,positive
Widely known as Don't Look in the Basement - this is pure 70s horror  B-movie goodness that could actually pass as the genre's version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Though the movie seems to go nowhere throughout the first hour+ of it's runtime  I enjoyed this particular batch of quirky crazies and their various personalities and deficiencies - such as the former army sergeant  a chick obsessed with caring for a plastic doll  a lovable man-child  and a loony nymph. After their head-doctor is murdered by a patient  a small sanitarium hires a new nurse onto their under-staffed facility  who becomes immersed in the resident's different ticks and outbursts. Things gradually become stranger  however  when patients start acting far more abnormal than usual... You never really know  or care  where the movie is going  'cause it still entertains up until it's completely whacked-out ending! Several of the twists felt a little too forced and I could have used a tad more blood  but I really dug this much too under-rated blend of humor and horror. Check it out...,positive
Back in the 70's  a small-time Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg directed a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget drive-in horror flicks which seem to have developed a small cult following over the years. Before viewing his first film  Don't Look In The Basement  I wasn't too sure what to expect  but I sure as hell didn't expect it to turn out to be the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw Massacre. I don't know  this might actually be my all-time favorite horror movie.<br /><br />We begin in an isolated insane asylum. At first  it seems like a rather laid-back place to get mentally healthy  considering all the patients are allowed to roam around freely and whatnot  as if it were their house (I guess it is). none of them seem all that dangerous  only delusional. The residents include a love-nympho  a 700 year old woman  a man-child  a spaz  a guy who thinks he's in a war  a woman who thinks she has a baby  and a guy who thinks he's a judge. One day  out of nowhere  Judge kills the doctor with an axe  shortly thereafter  the wanna-be baby mama kills the nurse. Ten minutes into the movie  and things are looking really ugly. Perhaps the new nurse will know what to do  then again  perhaps not. Giving away more would do more harm than good. It's best to plunge head first into this one  knowing as little as possible. If you can appreciate honest-to-God  untampered with horror  then you will not be disappointed. <br /><br />If you liked Scream  if you liked Wrong Turn  if you go for that unoriginal  over-produced  over-scored digital Hollywood garbage  then chances are high you just wont see the beauty in this one. Don't Look In The Basement  being a first attempt makes the quality all the more shocking. The atmosphere and the graininess fit into the location and the score like a glove. Unfortunately  good ol' S.F. used up most of his good ideas on his first movie  although  the next entry in his Texas-sized quadrilogy  is somewhat of a masterpiece  that is  if you're into extra sleazy  mean-spirited  Hixploitation like someone I know. If you fall in love with Brownrigg's first two  and absolutely must find out what else he had to offer  check out Don't Open The Door  and The House Where Hell Froze Over. Don't Look in The Basement has everything that successful horror needs  no stars  no budget  no digital effects  just an original story brought to life in an insane asylum  with a dozen cast members  and a somber  subtle score  and of course  the twist. This is real horror for the real horror fan. 10/10,positive
"Although it isn't mentioned very often  Don't Look in the Basement is a very interesting film and is definitely worth a watch. The story follows a young nurse  Charlotte Beale  who is hired at Stephen's Sanitarium to replace Dr. Stephens  after he is murdered by a patient. Many patients begin to torment Miss Beale  and her boss  Dr. Geraldine Masters  acts as if she's hiding something...<br /><br />This movie has many appealing characters that you actually end up caring about  and have sympathy for during the climax  which doesn't happen very often in horror films. The musical score is great and is reminiscent of Dark Shadows, the performance from Rosie Holotik  Rhea McAdams  and Bill McGhee are all great  the story is very intriguing with a great twist ending. This movie has a campy atmosphere around it that no other film I have ever seen has been able to capture. Many horror fans have never seen or even heard of this film which is really unfortunate because it could have been a horror classic. Don't Look in the Basement is definitely worth watching for all fans of 1970s drive-in films.",positive
A nurse travels to a rural psychiatric clinic run by Doctor Stephens. She is upset to learn that the doctor has died leaving his assistant Doctor Masters in charge.She is unnerved by the inmates including a crazy Judge a shell-shocked Vietnam vet a catatonic and a creepy nympho but is soon befriended by a hulking black man Sam.She needs all the friends she can get as people are dying all around her.Don't Look in the Basement is my first horror film of S.F Brownrigg.Despite its low-budget it manages to provide some genuine chills plus a nice amount of cheap gore including a particularly nasty scene with a desk-spindle through an eyeball.The climax of inmates taking control over mental asylum is an intense melange of wild camera-work gore and piercing screams.8 out of 10.,positive
Darling Lili is fantastic! Its by far one my favorite films! It certainly didn't deserve the poor reviews it received. Julie Andrews  playing the title role of Lili Smith (Schmidt) is the best part of the whole movie. She is entrancing and spectacular! As Julie Andrews is my most favorite actress and singer by far  I was most definatly not surprised by how stunning she is. This movie is just...great (I'm running out of adjectives!)  it's magnificent  marvellous  amazing  funny  terribly romantic  sad  and just an all-out thrill and its all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews!And to her husband  director Blake Edwards. Oh  yeah Rock Hudson was ok  too :)<br /><br />Julie Andrews is the beautiful and well-loved singer  Lili Smith. Rock Hudson portrays Major Larabee  who quickly falls for Lili  and she with him. But their affair was not coincedental. There meeting was planned by the German Government (I'm not sure if that's exactly what you'd call them  but you get the point)  because the warm  happy  singing entertainer Lili is actually a German Spy. Lili is told to seduce Major LArabee in order to get information of the new Top Secret Opertaion (later know as Crepe Suzette). Though Lili is on a solemn mission  she falls in love with Bill (Major Larabee)  for real  making her original quest challenging. But Lili pulls through and completes er task  after she finds out something that is not really true about Bill. The ending will remain unsaid by me as it is wonderfully layed out. If anything  you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie  I most certainly did!!!!!!!!<br /><br />,positive
Dr. Stephens (Michael Harvey)  head of a seriously understaffed institute for the insane  takes a 'progressive' approach towards the treatment of his patients  even allowing his loonies complete freedom of the building  day and night; he pays the price for his forward thinking  however  when he rather stupidly prescribes chopping wood with an axe as therapy for one of his patients and consequently gets his neck mistaken for a log (serves him right for not suggesting basket weaving).<br /><br />Shortly after this tragic incident  nurse Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrives at the hospital to take up position as the doctor's assistant  and discovers that the facility is now being run by the much sterner Dr. Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick). Despite being unaware of her deceased predecessor's decision to employ Ms Beale  and not particularly eager to take on new staff  Dr. Masters agrees to let the pretty nurse begin work  but following several harrowing experiences at the hospital  Charlotte begins to wonder whether it might have been better if she had been turned away.<br /><br />It doesn't take a genius to figure out what is actually happening at the hospital  the 'lunatics have taken over the asylum' schtick being a premise that should be familiar to most seasoned horror fans  but S.F. Brownrigg's Don't Look In The Basement still proves to be an entertaining piece of drive-in fun thanks to its well defined collection of nutters: lobotomised  popsicle-sucking Sam (Bill McGhee); Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Ross)  who continuously mumbles courtroom phrases; old Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams)  who recites William Allingham's creepy poem The Fairies and warns Charlotte of impending doom; cackling loon Danny (Jessie Kirby)  who delights in teasing the other patients; Harriet (Camilla Carr)  who thinks her doll is a real baby; army nut Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin); and best of all  Allyson King (Betty Chandler)  whose rejection by a series of men has left her with a craving for love (ie.  she tries to jump any man who goes near her).<br /><br />This convincingly crazy set of characters  plus a bit of gore and nudity  reasonable direction from Brownrigg (who also gave us the impressive white trash horror Scum of the Earth)  and a solid turn from Playboy covergirl Holotik  all go to turn an otherwise rather predictable  low budget piece of exploitation into a very watchable psycho shocker.,positive
I'm not sure what intrigues me about this movie so. It is grainy  poorly written  bleached out  often ridiculous  and at many points mind numbingly dull (the person I was watching it with fell asleep twice.) And yet there is something in this film that fascinates me  though I am not sure what; perhaps the character of Sam  an enormous former patient who was lobotimized by the former head doctor and who is perpetually sucking on an ice pop)  or the marvelously played head doctor (I forget her name).<br /><br />Anyway  watch it and form you're own opinion; it has one of the greatest endings I have seen in film.,positive
Young  ambitious nurse Ms. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to work at a mental asylum out in the middle of nowhere. During the course of 3 days  she encounters strange happenings  even a patient in her bedroom watching her  yet she still stays. The mental patients are all a little eye rolling (espically by the Judge)  but my favorite was the old crazy biddy (Rhea MacAdams). The storyline is okay at best  and the acting is surprisingly alright  but after awhile it's gets to be a little much. But  still it's fun  quirky  strange  and original.<br /><br />Note: The thing inside the basement is hardly horrifying  so the title is a little bananas.,positive
'Don't Look In the Basement' is so easy to knock but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of Horrors real underground stars and IMHO is vastly overdue some proper recognition. 'Don't' is his undisputed masterpiece. This scummy psychodrama snags the viewer straightaway into such an odd  disjointed  claustrophobic world of sweating insanity you have no real idea what the hell is going on. It succeeds in making you feel strangely dirty  just plain grubby  for Brownrigg's world is this mad  unwashed  scummy prison cell of rants  obsessions and all shades of mental illness. And he uses his low budget palette to wrap his grot blanket around you like a bad memory. There is just something so beautifully odd about the whole damn thing. In a word  classic.... Also  if you watch 'Don't' first then you will have some idea of the insane psychodrama style that marks Brownrigg's other films. In summary they really don't come any more esoteric than this - well  actually they do  track down Brownrigg's 'Keep My Grave Open'. Mad genius. Accept no substitute.,positive
... but you probably have seen it or else you wouldn't be here. It's so obscure that you probably stumbled onto it like I did because this little known gem receives no word-of-mouth.<br /><br />From the very beginning you know how the storyline will shake out but watching as our innocent redheaded nurse puts the pieces of the puzzle together is high quality entertainment. Most horror films bombard viewers with graphic displays of torture but Don't Look in the Basement plays it subtle  which makes for superior suspense. Note to horror filmmakers: some of us do like subtlety! Lovely and homely nurse Charlotte takes a job at a sanitarium but is dismayed when she learns that the head doctor who hired her had a gruesome accident and she is now the subordinate to a mysterious doctor  who we all know isn't a doctor at all. The suspense is built through Charlotte's unraveling of events with assistance from many of the patients  but which of the patients can Charlotte trust? This is a gem and is my absolute favorite TRUE HORROR movie. I love Re-Animator and Evil Dead but they play more for the HORROR-COMEDY crowd.<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$ (Quite tame for horror standards but there is a decent sprinkling of gore throughout the film. The opening scene is classic; no other horror film starts out better  and the end has its fair share of gore as well).<br /><br />NUDITY: $$$$ (Eager to fall in love Allyson (Betty Chandler) spends a good deal of time naked  attempting to seduce half the men at the sanitarium. Betty Chandler is a knockout and I am shocked that this is her only film credit).<br /><br />STORY: $$$$ (The story is well handled despite the premise getting a lot of mileage in Hollywood. The script has a knack for building suspense and never fails to place poor Charlotte in a precarious situation).<br /><br />ACTING: $$$$ (Betty Chandler does the best job here as Allyson  capturing dementia with naiveté in an ethereal form. The Judge was splendid as well  weighing facts before he came to a verdict while Rosie Holotik as Charlotte gives a genuine performance as you will feel for her character.,positive
"DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties List. The flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic. The main character  although way hotter than most low budget starlets  is a pretty standard low budget lead. The Doctor Masters character is well written and well acted. Some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie. It's Campy. I ain't trying to lie. The character that makes this great is a Faulknarian Man-Child named Sam  one of the patients in this sanitarium-gone-mad-flick. The gore is pretty standard although I think the color of the blood is awesome. It's so ..Red. This movie  I believe  was received poorly because of it advertising scheme. Some soulless little ad executive got his grubby hands on it and thought  Let's rip of the AD campaign for Last House on the Left, that's doing well. Little chumps like this have ruined the world of film. All balls and no brain. Also  the editor may or may not have been an alcoholic. Maybe there all drunk. You'll see what I mean. One more little note. Don't buy this from the Wally-Mart dollar rack. They have cut it to and unwatchable level. Try to find the longest cut you can.",positive
Yet another in the long line of Don't films of the late 70's and early 80's yet this one is much more than that. This film is a highly underestimated low budget schlocker with a twist. It has the grainy quality and bizarre soundtrack that is typical of horror films of the time period but it's the highly underestimated performances of the surprisingly talented actors/actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse arrives at Dr. Stephens' progressive mental hospital right after he has been murdered by one of his patients and all is not what it appears to be. It seems Dr. Masters  a rather ambitious female doctor  has taken over his duties and begun to implement her own ideas. Each of the patients take on their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and flaws which make for highly entertaining interactions. There is the nymphomaniac  the crazy old crone  the woman with an unhealthy obsession with infants  and a man who has reverted back to his childhood among others. There is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later finds the young nurse trapped inside the asylum with the patients running around loose and bodies piling up. If you are a fan of cheap 70's sleaze than this is the film for you!,positive
The impossibly sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale  a new nurse at one of those movie-type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own  unorthodox ways of treating the inmates. Reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams  a.k.a. Annabelle Weenick). The inmates don't take too kindly to Charlotte  either.<br /><br />Part mystery  part horror  this initial effort from B-movie director S.F. Brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it. These colorful psychos  including a nymphomaniac with no self-esteem  a gentle giant who's already had a lobotomy  and a supposed judge who speaks in legalese jargon  dominate the screen with their unnerving presence.<br /><br />It's a picture that works fairly well  establishing the gritty  grim atmosphere right from the get go. Some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality.<br /><br />It builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity  offering one surreal encounter after another. Particularly effective is the poetry-quoting  dotty old Mrs. Callingham.<br /><br />For cheap 1970's era cheese  it's pretty effective  with a particularly nasty climax. I had a pretty good time watching it.<br /><br />7/10,positive
I found the film Don't Look In The Basement to be very good  with some great characters in it. It is about a young psychiatric nurse called Nurse Charlotte Beale(Rosie Holotik) who is going to start work at a isolated mental asylum. Whilst there  she meets various sorts of different characters including Dr. Geraldine Masters who becomes in charge of the asylum after the the owner of the hospital Dr. Stephens gets killed by one of the patients by hitting him with an axe.<br /><br />My favourite characters in the film are Mrs Challingham(Reah MacAdams)  a very funny little old lady  Allison who is a nymphomaniac  and Sam(Bill McGhee) a young black guy who goes around all Day seeming to be in a world of his own all of the time. The film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film. I know that it was on the 'Video Nasties' list back in the 80's but a did not think that it had a lot of gore in it  Alothough it did have some disturbing senses in it GREAT FILM RECOMMENDED!!!.,positive
I personally have a soft spot for horror films that are set in hospitals and asylums so I had a good feeling about watching this Don't Look in the Basement  even though its reputation is doubtful. Well  turned out I was right! This is great  trashy entertainment with a couple of efficient shocks and delightfully absurd characters. You have to  of course  look beyond the poor productions values and the completely illogical plot but  if you manage to do that (and if you're a fan of this type of horror  that's an essential quality)  you'll be rewarded with an outrageous video-nasty in which blood and insanity form the main elements. The young and cute nurse Charlotte arrives at a remote sanitarium where she's supposed to start her new job. She finds out that the Doctor who hired her was killed by a patient and the replacement doctor-in-charge Masters seems reluctant to accept the new arrival. The life inside the sanitarium is rather peculiar  with the patients running around free and every door is kept unlocked. After a whole series of bizarre events  Charlotte discovers the horrific secrets that the institution hides.... The opening 10 minutes (pre-credits) are great and so is the completely deranged climax. Everything in between is pretty much without surprise or tension but you patiently wait because you just feel that the finale will be wild fun. The asylum's patients are textbook lunatics  but I love them nevertheless. Some of my favorites include the former judge (who still talks exclusively in legal terms)  the suspicious army-Sargeant and the mad-raving old lady. Don't Look in the Basement is great low-brained fun  especially recommended to fans of 70's trash-cinema  sick puppies and other types of scum. The lunatics have taken over the asylum  yeah!!,positive
This often maligned movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards  Julie Andrews  Henry Mancini  or Hollywood musicals. Other writers have commented on the shifts in tone  the confusion of plot  etc.  but the film has many things to recommend it. The score is one of Henry Mancini's best (and he has written many wonderful ones)  several songs are sung to perfection by Andrews  Julie's performance is nuanced and she is decked out in some beautiful clothes  (she is at her absolutely loveliest here)  the on-location shots are breath-taking  and there are some funny Inspector Clouseau-type sight gags to boot. Rock Hudson basically phoned in his performance  but he is passably good. A real curiosity item in that it was the last major film Julie did for about 10 years and  in many ways  is a precursor to Victor/Victoria. It is lovely to look at and listen to. When will it be available on DVD??? When it is  I for one would like both versions--the longer and shorter  director's cut. Since it was lampooned in S.O.B.  they would make a great two-pack!,positive
Low-budget but memorable would-be shocker that instead emerges as theater of the bizarre. Vulnerable  naive nurse Charlotte Beale comes to a secluded mental hospital and is completely unaware that the only sane people have been murdered  despite the red flags that are constantly being raised all around her. <br /><br />The lack of a decent budget really gives the filmmakers little more to go on than a sense of style  as well as a cast of wacky characters. The pleasures of this film don't come from the film's shocks  which are fairly tame  but from the weird atmosphere. First we have the delusional woman who thinks her baby doll is real. There's also an axe-murdering judge  a shell-shocked war veteran  and old Mrs. Callahan is like everybody's daffy elderly grandmother gone amok. A young patient named Allyson gives the term nymphomaniac new meaning. A big guy named Sam is just a little slow after a botched lobotomy  and Jennifer vaults suddenly between catatonia and violent outbursts. The only other sentient person in the place seems to be Dr. Masters  but does she have a secret?<br /><br />Don't Look in the Basement is a great example of low-budget exploitation films. There isn't much plot going on  but the cheapness works for the movie. Several cast members turn in memorable performances  particularly Betty Chandler and Annabelle Weenick  and the way the director adds little weird details to the movie can really stick with you.<br /><br />The scene between Allyson and the telephone man is a classic for all time  and especially delicious are the facial expressions of Dr. Masters when she begins to go over the edge near the finale of the movie. Brownrigg also makes great use of the cheap soundtrack  with several musical cues really evoking the characters that they accompany. My favorite cue is the crazy cue  a sitar that twangs whenever one of the patients does something pathological.<br /><br />Also wonderful is the way that Charlotte herself plunges into hysteria at the climax  with the patients revealing that Dr. Masters is simply another inmate  and then suggesting that CHARLOTTE is also a patient who is being allowed to act out her delusions (she certainly has a tenuous grip on reality  why else would she not question the ominous lack of phone service or outside contact?). The scene where Charlotte manages to finish off the barely-alive Dr. Stephens with a toy boat has to be one of the greatest moments in low-budget horror. Yes  Don't Look in the Basement could very well be the American Beauty of Grade Z trash.,positive
"This is such a fun and funny movie. Highly entertaining at all angles. It features an outlandish array of memorable  psychotic but lovable nuts. We got; the judge  the Sargent  the kid  the creepy old lady  the slut  the clown. And unfortunately they all live in a big house that doesn't have any locks and is understaffed. So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around  play games  and be dangerous. We also learn a lesson along the way... never give your patient an ax! <br /><br />This was before Cukkos Nest  AND surpasses it. At least on the fun level. It even has its sweet moments. Love is pure. Love is grace. Love is strength. You love me, your love is pure, you'll always love me. Now who could resist that? Nuts are humans too. Just a few loose wires. Be a little careful  or you'll get an ax in the back! Children at play. Hehe.<br /><br />The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine. All the characters in this film are tremendously well played. And I really did find them funny. No  HILARIOUS! They may even give you dirty thoughts of how you can take advantage of them. Or how they can take advantage of you.<br /><br />This is actually a very smart movie. There is a brilliant twist ending. I must say I expected this to be a good but never expected THIS. It is horrific. The court has made its decision. You are no longer in control! I love it. The ending is so  SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.<br /><br />I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this. I will never forget it now. It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC. Whatever you do... Don't Look In The Basement !!!",positive
Nurse Charlotte Beale(the lovely Rosie Holotik)has arrived to Dr. Stephens' clinic for the insane prepared for a new job. What she doesn't expect is to find another supposed doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by axe-wielding maniacal judge Oliver W Cameron(..in a running gag  anytime he confronts a situation out of his control  he retreats to repeating his name). That doctor is Geraldine Masters(Annabelle Weenick)who isn't sure about whether Beale is a proper fit for their establishment. After a long discussion about the position(which is quite an awkward scene as the two debate about Beale's being sent a letter by Stephens getting a job at the clinic with Masters often reminding her that he is no longer in charge)Masters agrees to let her work in the nursing position  but the good Doctor may not be who she seems..<br /><br />The assortment of loonies includes Sam(Bill McGee)a simple-minded child-man who was Stephens' last victim of lobotomy  Jennifer(Harryette Warren)a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she wallows at Masters' heel like a puppy  Danny(Jessie Kirby)a trouble-making annoyance often trying to steal the fake baby of disturbed Harriet(Camilla Carr)  Allyson(Betty Chandler)a sexy nympho who just wants to be loved and hops at any man she sees  & Sergeant Jaffee(Hugh Feagin)your typical case of soldier who hasn't escaped the madness of war.<br /><br />The film shows Masters' unorthodox methods of running the clinic with allowing the patients to roam free with the doors to all rooms without locks calling into question..and  not to mention  the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around despite just chopping Dr. Stephens with an axe. And  what exactly happened to Dr. Stephens? Ah ha..<br /><br />Tacky 70's drive-in trash is a lot of fun if you are into a warped brand of cinema. I'm attracted to bizarre flicks about mental rejects because of their unpredictable nature..you just never know what the hell might happen  especially in this case where they are allowed to roam often unattended. Some consider the low budget a liability  but in the case of this film  I think it enhances the experience.

"If anyone ever assembles a compendium on modern American horror that is truly worth it's salt  there will *have* to be an entry for SF Brownrigg's ubiquetous exercize in Asylum Horror. Every time I watch this movie I am impressed by the complete economy of the film  from the compact  totally self-contained plot with a puzzling beginning and an all too horrible ending  the engaging performances by what was essentially a group of non-professional actors  and a prevading sense of dread and claustrophobia that effectively consumes the narrarive with a certain inevitability which is all the more terrifying because the viewers know what is going on long before the hero[es]  with the only question being when are they going to wake up & smell the coffee?<br /><br />Shot on a dental floss budget in Brownrigg's native Texas at an old palatial manor that nicely serves as the setting for a private sanitorium  DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is another intriguing twist on the good old Edgar Allan Poe tome about inmates taking over the asylum just before an otherwise normal outsider unwittingly joins the ranks without realizing until it is far too late that not all is what it seems  they are totally cut off & beyond any outside help  and inevitably find their own sanity questioned as the madness spins out of control -- The Original STAR TREK TV series had a go at this with their WHOM GODS DESTROY episode from 1968  Juan Moctezuma gave the proceedings a peyote fueled Mexican psychedelic trip in DR. TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON in 1972  and tangentially related is Fernando Di Leo's ASYLUM EROTICA/SLAUGHTER HOTEL  which injects the elements of an unknown killer and an ending that can only be defined as Splatter Cinema -- Brownrigg may not have seen or been thinking of SLAUGHTER HOTEL  but he sure came up with some similar ideas.<br /><br />Legaliciuos former Playboy Playmate Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale  RN in Clinical Psychology  who has just left her nice job as a supervisor at a major hospital to travel way out into the middle of some god forsaken waste right out of a Peckinpah movie to work with a Dr. Stevens at his private sanitorium. Dr. Stevens has pioneered a new form of therapy based upon basically encouraging the emotionally & psychologically scarred to face their inner obsessions  bring them to the surface and hopefully rid the patients of whatever has fried their sense of reasoning. Nice idea  but arming a 6ft 250 pound utterly insane man with an axe and telling him to pound out his aggression AND THEN TURNING YOUR BACK ON HIM probably isn't the smartest idea  and Dr. Stevens is dispatched before Ms. Holotik even appears onscreen with a good whack to the lower portion of his skull.<br /><br />This event leaves the sanitorium effectively in the hands of one Geraldine Masters [actress Annabelle Weenick  who also served as the script supervisor & production manager]  a woman of startlingly professional demeanor who quickly defuses the situation with the help of Sam  the film's wonderfully unlikely hero  a lobotomized African American boheomouth played by an actor named Bill McGhee who was sadly robbed of a supporting Oscar nomination for his turn as a mass of muscle with the brain of an 8 year old boy. Sam's one wish is to have someone help him put his prized toy boat in the water  and his continual asking of the various female cast members to do so [and his nonstop consumption of chocolate popsicles] as *SOME* kind of underlying theme  though we will avoid such here because the kids might still be up. There is also a quick subplot about a staff member who has decided to leave after being threatened by one of the patients  but I'll leave the details of that to your discovery.<br /><br />Ms. Holotik arrives just as Dr. Stevens has been effectively laid to rest and is quickly won over by the snappy professionalism of Ms. Masters  who reluctantly allows the leggy young nurse to stay on in spite of the tragedy that has just happened  oh  TWENTY MINUTES AGO  which you must admit was rather sporting of her. Holotik's Nurse Beale begins to demonstrate symptoms of not being the sharpest meat cleaver in the drawer  however  when informed that she shares living quarters with a bunch of maniacs and there are no locks on the doors & doesn't trudge off for the nearest Ace Hardware Store to pick up a hasp and padlock to secure herself  and we are treated to a couple of truly creepy scenes where some of the inmates sneak into her room & do stuff like smell her hair  try to kill her with butcher knives and caress her neck with axe heads. But that's all a part of working in such a radical psychiatric health care environment  Ms. Master's informs her  and she goes about her oddly defined rounds that consist of wearing as leg defining a nurse outfit as you can find in a 42nd Street fetish boutique and getting to know the inmates.<br /><br />Allysson is a obsessive compulsive nymphomaniac with homicidal tendancies who likes to take off her shirt & provide the film with some T & A between fits of histrionics; Harriet is a young former mother who let her child die in a stupid accident and now dotes on a beat-up old doll that she is also homicidally protective of; The Seargant is an actual seargeant [and implied Vietnam vet] who's negligence led to the death of his platoon  and now watches from the window with binoculars for the approach of an unseen enemy; Jennifer is a Phish fan who couldn't score a ticket to the New Year's Eve Show and went insane & likes to scarf down nembutols and other barbituates when nobody is looking  and likewise has hidden homicidal tendancies linked to her inability to find a bra; Judge Cameron is apparently a homicidal pervert who became obsessed with his own sense of power and now likes to chop things up with axes; Ms. Callingham is an aged poet who serves as a sort of soothsaying old hag from MACBETH before the cat gets her tongue; and Danny is an insane idiot who was included in the cast as the random element that the plot cannot control  and who's antics serve as the real catalyst for the series of tragedies & murders that ultimately take place in this dark  old  creepy house in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />The house itself is a wonderful set  with a threadbare early 1970's decor that is remarkable in it's unremarkableness  with a fantastic use of color achieved by subtle ambient lighting. The house is a series of hallways and rooms with shiny brown wooden floors  twisting  confined stairways  secreted closets and passageways leading to the different larger areas  and of course the basement mentioned in the title -- visited only once  but boy it sure proves to be a doozy! I love the frosted old freezer where Sam keeps his stash of popsicles  the utterly plain exteriors that remind me of a summer home our family used to visit every year & force us to swelter in the heat: Everyone is covered with beads of persperation and looks exhausted  and even the ever cheerful Sam at one point begins to suspect that bad things are happening  though he cannot understand what it all means and Rosie H. is too firm in her belief of her profession to even suspect what has really happened  and while Ms. Holotik's limitations of an actress may have diminished the effectiveness of her Big Revelation scene  she's a great screamer when all Hell starts to break loose  and Brownrigg indulged of some nice camera shots of her in various suggestive poses or stages of undress that show off what a pretty lady she is without exposing anything more than her contract stipulated. Too bad!<br /><br />The real show stealer is Sam  however  and fans of what I have been taught to refer to as Splatter Cinema will not be disappointed by the rather shocking finale  and there is something moving about how Sam runs to the protection of his friend and brutally kills everyone within arms reach in a matter of seconds that either suggests he was one mean motha before his lobotomy  or the film is CUT. In any event you won't be prepared for the ending the first time you see it  even though you as the viewer know what the score is long before anyone else in the film has put it all together.<br /><br />Except for one person: Rhea MacAdams' uproariously stereotyped old coot Mrs. Callingham [who seems to be inspired by the Donald Sutherland Old Woman character from the Michael Reeves' 1964 Christopher Lee film CASTLE OF THE LIVING DEAD  in addition to a rather nasty death by round spike to the eye]  who not only predicts the future  but has the film's most laugh out loud amusing bit of dialogue while on a walk in the garden with Ms. Holotik that runs something like this --<br /><br />It's really beautiful out here. Do you get out much, Mrs. Callingham? asks Holotik  to which the old woman replies<br /><br />It's YOU who needs to get out.<br /><br />Hilarious  and one of those things you gotta kind of see for yourself to get. DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is available on at least a half dozen bargain bin codefree DVD releases by companies like Brentwood Home Video  Diamond Entertainment  VCI and Platinum Disc Corp.'s HORROR CLASSICS series; I kind of like Alpha Video's sexily gorgeously decorated $6 release from 2003:<br /><br />Dig through those bargain bins! But make sure you get one with the 89/90 minute print contained therein; an older 83 minute version is downright confusing due to some of the trims  and you really need to see the ending credits as intended to bring this sick  twisted and surprisingly entertaining yarn to it's end.<br /><br />Masterpiece? Maybe not compared to THE EXORCIST or ROSEMARY'S BABY  but it is a very uniquely American horror film  and a genuine classic of the drive-in age that deserves to be rediscovered by anyone looking for something made with more than just a little bit of brain juice  and not a penny more than they absolutely needed.<br /><br />***1/2 out of ****",positive
"Charlotte Beal arrives at an isolated country mental hospital to become a full-time nurse there. She is confronted with a motley group of crazies and a seemingly crazier supervisor. Is Dr. Masters all she seems to be?<br /><br />DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT is one of the best low-budget movies in the genre and why people always put it down is beyond me. The acting is excellent  my favorite performance being by Betty Chandler as Allyson the nymphomaniac. The chills just jump right off the screen. You probably won't have to say It's only a movie, it's only a movie  it isn't that scary  but it should appeal to any horror fan who respects the low-budget horror genre  which I do. It is very hard to make a creepy film on a low budget and few actually succeed. AXE is another cheap film that is looked down upon. Maybe people are so spoiled by the big budgets of recent films that any movie that doesn't have excellent effects and/or isn't considered a classic doesn't have a chance with an audience. But I think that after people see this movie  they will see how important the low-budget horror genre is and this movie is a classic that stands out among the other rubbish.",positive
You'll either love or hate movies such as this thriller set inside a lonesome asylum in a far off lonesome land. It's not so much of a horror show  but a concoction of frightening imageries and wackozoid mental patients. Scream is the best term to use in what was obviously a popular drive-in classic noted for some strange and wicked behaviors. Notice the judge  who's about to put on the ax from behind the doctor! Brr-r-r-r!!! Not much else can be described here other than some bloody tasty goodness  but when you get a chance  remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady: Get out! Get out! And never ever come back!. Don't you wish you haven't looked in the basement?,positive
If you love drive-in cheeze from the early '70s you will just love this one.How could you go wrong with a low budget film about bloodshed in a lunatic asylum? You can't! Crazy folks and sharp objects are always an entertaining combination.<br /><br />The film looks like it was shot inside someone's house for about $320.65. For me that just ads to the fun of watching this type of stuff.The gore is a bit mild compared to others of this ilk but there is enough to keep us bloodthirsty sickos (like myself)happy.Some horror films drag in parts and leave you waiting for something to happen.That's not the case here.The characters are entertaining enough to make every frame quite enjoyable.There is never a dull moment from start to finish.The mind melting climax at the end that is just unbelievable. I liked it so much that right after the end credits I watched it a second time.It's an absolute must see for any self respecting drive-in horror nut.<br /><br />9.5/10 on the Drive-in-Freak-O-Meter...required viewing<br /><br />Yea I love you..I DO love you...now take your Thorazine and put your clothes back on...please....8),positive
I was unsure what to expect from driving lessons- unsure whether Rupert Grint could carry such a role  but within the first few minutes I was completely hooked. All the way through  the music  acting and scenery were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters  as always  gave a superb performance as the eccentric old actress Evie  and Rupert Grint  equally as good gave a fantastic performance as the romantic Ben.<br /><br />Right from the beginning  I was forced into involuntary cringes  bursts of laughter and swellings of joy as Ben broke free from his controlling mother and fought for his friendship with his only friend  Evie. A very controversial story  probably rather exaggerated but none the less one of the best films i have seen in a long time.<br /><br />Highly recommend to anyone seeking a good British film and an evening to kick-back and just enjoy yourself.,positive
I had to get this movie  since it didn't come to where I live. I waited patiently and it was worth the wait. I totally fell in love with this movie. The chemistry between Walters and Grint you could see  since they also worked together on the Harry Potter movies.The woman who plays his overbearing  righteous mother really had me convinced all right and how much of a hypocrite she is  I think she did a great job playing the role. I only wish we could of had seen the actually sex scene or more of it. LOL  but of course we just have to use our imagination on how it went down. (snickers) I totally thought the movie was worth the wait and if you want a good movie to watch. Rent this movie. I do have to say that Rupert really did a great job and it's nice to see that he's doing movies outside of Harry Potter even though I totally love him as Ron Weasley. The whole cast did a great job and I hope Rupert continues to act outside of Harry Potter to broaden his skill!,positive
"I had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as I was perusing the shelves at a local rental store. Having just watched the latest Harry Potter installment  I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. Reading the description on back about an overzealous, evangelical Christian do-gooder, and identifying as an evangelical Christian  myself  I thought  Ooohthis should be interesting. And so it was. I found Mr. Brock's story beautiful in both words and images; and sadly enough  all too familiar. The contrast he drew between Ben's parent's interpretations of what it means to be a Christian was a poignant commentary on how Christians view themselves and the impact that perception has on those around them. On the one hand  we have Ben's mom stating  Whatever happens behind these walls, Ben, we're God's ambassadors. We show the world a smiling face. On the other hand is Ben's dad discussing truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film. At the end of his monologue  he states  The more a person parades their Christianity for the benefit of others, the less I am inclined to trust the Christianity they claim. God tells us true faith is the freedom to choose truth. Now, how you express that, the way, the manner, the means at your disposal, these things are of no consequence, be you Christian or atheist, unless in your heart you are true. If only our churches were full of Christians who ascribed to this latter definition of what it means to be a follower of Jesus  rather than the former. What a difference that would make! As a Christian and a psychologist  I would want an imperfect yet authentic faith over a perfectly polished image any day. What a tragedy  to feel like I always need to play a role when  really  I just need to rest in the freedom of being completely who God made me to be. I think Mr. Brock provides a refreshing glimpse of what this freedom in Christ looks like. I recommend this film for anyone who desires a fresh look at faith.",positive
I thought this movie was cleverly written and very well acted. Its a movie that greatly surpasses other films in terms of originality and enjoyment.Rupert Grint played the part marvelously  and has a general knack for the acting business. The almost obsessive mother added quite a lot to the plot  and was a character one could almost instantly loathe. This reminded me  in a way  of the Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. Not by means of actual content of the film  but the premises  and overall tone to the film itself. Driving Lessons is a coming of age story  which many might find very easy to relate to due to the overpowering mother  the lack of freedom  and the discovery of oneself.,positive
I thought it was going to be a lousy movie  honestly  I mean  Rupert Grint  RON  acting in a movie different from Harry Potter  was actually really difficult to picture it. But as the movie started  it showed that this guy does have talent  I mean  is the best actor of the HP trio  for reference  have you seen Emma Watson trying to act? Or what about Daniel's acting? Both lack experience even though they have acted in a million Harry Potter movies. Ben  his character is a very shy boy  incapable of showing his true feelings about everything  his despise about his over ruling mom and the resentful anger towards his father who is unable to step up and confront his unfaithful wife. Julie Walters was absolutely brilliant! Her interpretation of an old retired actress trying to live with the shadow of her past  while she tries to remember Shakespearian sonnets is absolutely wonderful! Also  it appears that many youth is wasted in religious nonsense acts.,positive
This movie is a great film. The movie shows so many themes all in one amazing film. Driving Lessons centers around Ben (Rupert Grint) a shy 17 year old who is coming of age. The movie goes on about how Ben is sick of his dominating mother and how he just wants to be himself. Ben then meets Evie  who he makes a very special bond with. The two take a journey and in the process Ben finds himself and what a relationship that he and Evie share. This is the movie that you watch by yourself  or with someone else. No matter what  you will all feel what Ben goes through in the movie. It is a very heart warming film that just makes you think whether your driving lessons were ever as emotional or as much of a journey as Ben's Lessons.,positive
I  being a fan of Rupert Grint  rented this film a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors. It was entertaining  and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his most well known character of Ron Weasley. His subtle portrayal of Ben and everyone else's great acting made this film very likable.<br /><br />Ben  a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother  is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the  I guess you could call assistant to Evie  a retired actress. At first  it is just a way for him to earn some money. But after a while  he and Evie seem to develop a friendship. Evie helps Ben break out of his shell a little and gets him to have fun and be happy with himself  and in the end they both seem to need each other.<br /><br />Whether you are a fan of Rupert Grint or not  this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors.,positive
I'd heard about this movie  but didn't see it until my daughter  who saw it on a flight to Australia  told me it was a great movie. I was interested in seeing whether Rupert Grint  away from Harry Potter  was showing the promise you see in the Potter movies. I wasn't disappointed. He's become a fine actor  showing a range in Driving Lessons from a shy boy being beaten down by an over-bearing obsessive mother  to a young man finding himself to be worthy of his own  and other's  esteem. Going over lines from plays and poetry with his aging-actress employer  it's obvious that he's ready to take on much more complex roles in films and the stage. But the jewel of this movie was Julie Walters. I'd seen her previously in the Potter movies  Billy Elliott and Calendar Girls  and loved her. In Driving Lessons  as she does lines from poetry and Shakespeare  I was awed by her timing  command of the language  and body language. I'm hoping it was make-up/costuming  as she portrays an older woman with osteoporosis  though no mention of it is made in the movie-- as a nurse  I can say that she did this perfectly  portraying a woman on the brink of old-age  but clinging to the sparkling past that she reveled in. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time  and I wish I'd seen it in a theatre first-- but I doubt it ever played anywhere here in Albuquerque. We miss out on so many of these types of movies here.,positive
I really only watched this movie because it had Rupert Grint in it (who I knew as Ron from the Harry Potter movies). I had never really appreciated Rupert as an actor until this movie. I loved the entire film. Rupert does a wonderful job in this hilarious  quirky movie. I think the movie could have been fine without the sex  but it worked somehow. I can't wait to see more of Rupert's films in the future. Julie Walters also did an amazing job. In the Harry Potter movies  she has a very small role  so I didn't quite know what to expect from her either. But she was wonderful as Dame Evie. The part where she swallows the key was absolutely hilarious. Overall  an amazing movie.,positive
Ben Marshall  a teen ager from a religious background  is made aware about the financial situation at home by his domineering mother Laura. She suggests him to find a temporary job in order to contribute to the household. In fact the family has taken a widower  to board with them. Robert Marshall  the father  is a pastor at the local church; he'd much rather be in the country watching birds than tending to the souls entrusted to his church.<br /><br />The job Ben applies is with an older actress  Evie Walton  who wants him to do things for her around the house. Dame Evie  as she calls herself  is a woman of a certain age whose career has died maybe because she was not that great. In fact the only memorable appearance seems to be in a soap opera which was popular but she'd rather forget about it. Evie  who is a compulsive liar  tells Ben she's dying  only to forget it conveniently  later on when she comes clean to the boy. <br /><br />Ben is obviously in awe of the larger than life personality of his employer. He has been taking driving lessons. Evie asks him to take a camping trip  which he does against his better judgment. He knows that it will provoke his mother's fury. Not content with that  Evie decides to go on to Edinburgh  where she has been invited to read at an arts festival. It is this trip that solidifies their bond. Ben gets to meet and taste the pleasures of the flesh with a sympathetic Bryony.<br /><br />When Ben gets back  everything crumbles at home. His mother  who has been having an affair with a parishioner  decides to leave the family in favor of the young man she has been having an affair with. Ben and Evie's relationship survives the test of time. He also begins to see his own father in a different light. <br /><br />Jeremy Brock  the writer of Driving Lessons and other memorable English films  takes his first directorial job with this engaging comedy. The mixture of show business and religion  loyalty and friendship  are explored in his screen treatment making it a fun time at the movies. We have seen the similar situation before as in Billy Elliott  where Julie Walters plays a nurturing role with a younger man. We had read the film was based on Mr. Brock's own experience while working Dame Peggy Ashcroft when he was young. <br /><br />Julie Walters  who plays Evie Walton  is perhaps the best excuse to watch the movie. She always delivers. Ms. Walters is a welcome presence in any film she appears and she does wonders with her fake dame. Laura Linney  a luminous player herself  doesn't quite get our sympathy with her icy mother. Rupert Grint  famous for his Harry Potter's movies plays Ben  the young man who sees in Evie a kind soul. Nicholas Farrell is the betrayed father. Michelle Duncan has a small role in which she shines.,positive
lovely. i just love the movie. i want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are great  spectacular. the movie was excellent. Julie Walters it was perfect too. I think that Rupert is the only boy with red hair that i love. Rupert have a beautiful smile  a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. i think that the movie was great and was great see Rupert in another thing but harry potter. and its a very good actor  so it deserves that and more. he just have a golden globe but probably it deserves an Oscar academy award. there are some actors that do not act very well but have a Oscar anyway. it does not matter. but he is perfect  brilliant and beautiful,positive
I suppose I like this film as well as any I know; it is not perfect  but under the title The Americanization of Lily this charming and memorable semi-musical satire might I suggest have been appreciated more  and still loved by those who recognized its special Blake Edwards'-produced spirit of gentleness  clever humor and solid narrative. The improbably but delightful story-line follows Lili Smith  a fringe-type spy for the Germans in a much simpler and less black-and-white war; Lili Schmidt passing as Smith is helping her Uncle who is patriotic too  for Germany but neither cruel nor political  merely opportunistic. Lili's target is William Larrabee  a charismatic U.S. squadron leader who can supply her valuable information. The plot thickens comes when Lili falls in love with Larrabee  has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy  and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes. She gets jealous of a rival for Larrabee's affections  then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business. The logical end of the film comes when after the terrible WWI has ended  as she sings the theme song of the film  Wishing in a darkened theater  one by one the members of Larrabee's squadron appear  including her lover himself  indicating they have forgiven her and their former opponents; and even Uncle Kurt enthusiastically joins in the singing of It's a Long To Tipperraree  to indicate all is well with the world again. This is an audacious and sometime brilliant story idea  written by director Blake Edwards and William Peter Blatty of John Goldfarb fame; and it is a delightful narrative. Larrabee's squadron  including an inebriate who keeps crashing and other lovable types populate this lively film; and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic  both in its scope and realization. Credit must go to Jack Bear and Donald Brooks for their costume creations  Reg Allen and Jack Stevens for sets  Fernando Carrere for another beautiful production design  Henry Mancini for his sensitive and appropriate musical score  and to Russell Harlan for his shining cinematography. In the beautiful footage  the principal actors are Julie Andrews as Lili  Rock Hudson as Larrabee  Keremy Kemp outstanding as Lili's Uncle Kurt  Michael Witney  Lance Percival as the inebriate pilot  gorgeous Gloria Paul as Lili's stripteasing rival  and many other fine actors in smaller parts. It is hard to say enough nice things about the pace  or the cleverness of the just-this-side-of broad comedy; this element is introduced by Edwards to leaven the horrors of actual warfare  to example the almost comic-opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent-minded era of human civilization.. This comedy also helps prepare the way for Lili's conversion from uncritical acceptance of a duty to the German state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing. This is a rare sense-of-life film about Lili's Americanization  her assertion of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen. It is haunting  I find  and beautiful in many ways. I consider it to be Blake Edwards'masterpiece of directing; and under the title The Americanization of Lili I believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished sapphire of a film it is by every standard I know.,positive
DRIVING LESSONS is a little film that sneaks up on you. What at first seems to be a bit of fluffy nonsense comedy British style is at its base a very fine story about coming of age and the needs for significant friendship of both the young and the elderly. Writer Jeremy Brock ('Mrs. Brown'  'Charlotte Gray'  'The Last King of Scotland') here directs his own screenplay and the result is a cohesive  progressively involving tale filled with fascinating and diverse characters  each performed by sterling actors.<br /><br />Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint  standing firmly on his own as a developing actor post 'Harry Potter' series) is a quiet  plain little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching Vicar father (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive  rigid  evangelical do-gooder mother (Laura Linney) in a home where 'needy people'  such as the murderous cross-dressing Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton)  take precedence over family matters: the mother is by the way having an affair with priest Peter (Oliver Milburn)  using Ben as her cover! Sad Ben is among other things attempting to learn to drive a car. His mother is a poor teacher and decides he needs professional lessons AND needs to get a job to help pay for poor Mr. Fincham's needs. Ben follows an ad and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters)  an elderly has-been actress who is as zany as any character ever created. She hires Ben and the fireworks begin. Through a series of incidents  including a camping trip Evie demands they take  the two learn life's lessons missing from each other's natures: Ben learns self respect and self confidence and Evie finds a true friend who will allow her to drop her stagy facade and be the dear human being she has been hiding.<br /><br />Julie Walters  always offering the finest skills of acting in every character she creates  finds a role like no other here: she is outlandishly wild and lovable. Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the challenged coming of age Ben. The chemistry between the two is as tender as that in the classic film 'Harold and Maude'. Laura Linney is as always a superb actress playing a role quite different from her usual repertoire. And the supporting cast is a panorama of fine characterizations. This film is a delightful surprise and one sure to warm the heart and entertain those who love fine writing and direction and acting - and message! Grady Harp,positive
After seeing the Harry Potter movies  I've been a fan of the trio actors Rupert Grint  Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson; yet  we've been waiting to see if they would do other projects besides play the same characters year or every two years of the J.K. Rowling series. Mainly instead of a trio  the cameras and magazine articles concentrate more on Daniel and Emma  being that they're the leading male and only leading female in the saga leaving Rupert dead-end. No matter  every actor has a time to shine and Rupert's light hits him for once in this movie.<br /><br />Driving Lessons is called the Harold and Maude of this generation with Rupert Grint playing the role of Ben Marshall  a young British lad who lives with his domineering mother (Laura Linney) and a wimp of a vicar (priest) father for which he wants a job in the summer but can't find work while at the same time taking his driving tests (and failing) and writing poetry for a young girl who doesn't have any interest in him.<br /><br />Ben seeks an ad in a church newspaper for which the job requires to take care of an elderly lady. He takes the job and realizes that he's in for a fun of surprises as Evie (Julie Walters  Rupert's mother in the Harry Potter series) an out-of-work actress who is also a poet giving Ben the run for his money. They bond where and tell each other secrets along with Evie acting like a child and getting into mischief where she drags Ben along for a country road trip. From their not only does Ben drive all the way from Britain to Scotland since Evie needs to recite at a local library  but at the same time an older lady falls for the young man in which Ben starts becoming a man.<br /><br />There is mishap and at the same time rejoice with Ben and Evie along with saying that I was very pleased about the film when it came out in theaters and I was impressed with Rupert Grint's acting  especially if he showed the rest of the world that even though he brings a bit of Ron Weasley within Ben Marshall  there's no stopping the actor on his brilliant performance.,positive
"Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson  while on an assignment for Germany.<br /><br />The songs are beautiful. The two are well-paired. Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays. <br /><br />A half-German  half-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in WW I  Julie sings some endearing Mancini songs. <br /><br />I loved the film. Some will say it's a chick-flick, but so what. It's wonderful. <br /><br />Supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped. It may not be up to Rock's performance in Pillow Talk  Magnificent Obsession  or Giant.<br /><br />Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland and authentic WW I -type planes were used in the film. Scenery for England and France is absolutely gorgeous.",positive
I've felt that Rupert Grint has a lot of promise from that role by which everyone knows him. So even though I had never heard of this film before  when it appeared in my cable TV listings  I immediately switched to that channel. I am so happy that I did! <br /><br />I've read from other reviewers that they don't generally like coming of age stories; I on the other hand quite do. I am one of those who is always coming of age; I have been since I was 12  I'm 52 now  and I will probably continue until I'm 92. Coming of age is nothing more than suddenly realizing the possibilities that another day brings. The suddenness of the realization  the magnitude of it  sometimes throws us into disarray. If we try to shelter our delicate selves from that  then yes  I can see how the coming of age can end. But if we simply dust ourselves off  and settle into the new direction we've discovered  then we're all of a sudden on a new path  and we're just as alive as we were yesterday  only stronger  brighter  and I daresay  more interesting. <br /><br />So that's what this movie was about. This was a coming of age story all the way round; young Ben  his father  Father Robert  and certainly Dame Evie... all went through a marvelous transformation. In fact  so too did Mr. Fincham  didn't he?! All did  I suspect  except in fact the mother  in spite of her enormous opportunity so to do  provided by the events of the end of the film. One is left with the feeling that she will continue on exactly the same path she's been on  only with perhaps a different supporting cast.<br /><br />So an excellent film  that could not possibly have been made in America  which is utterly depressing to think about  but thank God we have a steady supply of films made elsewhere that we occasionally get to see. I really heartily recommend this film  so long as you don't mind cringing through those parts of it that are all too familiar to us all  and grinning through all the rest of it.,positive
"A beautiful film. One that made me think of god but not feel guilty nor overwhelmed. Made me think about death but not fear it  think about life but not hide from it. A movie that gave both love for all I stand for and at the same time condemned it to the deepest pits of hell. A movie that made me think of love and all that I have lost  but no sadness graced my eyes  for some strange reason  relief. A child of two worlds  god and theater. And a good bit of wine and irony! I most highly recommend *****<br /><br />When The S*** Hits The Fan, Get A Tent Oh and we should all go camping. Every day.",positive
Sweet  entertaining tale of a young 17 1/2 year old boy  controlled by by an overbearing religious mother and withdrawn father  and how he finds himself through his work with a retired  eccentric and tragic actress. Very well acted  especially by Julie Walters. Rupert Grint plays the role of the teenage boy well  showing his talent will last longer than the Harry Potter series of films. Laura Linney plays his ruthlessly strict mother without a hint of redemption  so there's no room to like her at all. But the film is a very entertaining film  made well by the British in the style of the likes of Keeping Mum and Calendar Girls.,positive
Loved this movie  what a hoot. Rupert and Julie are great together with Rupert being almost poker faced against Julie's animation  which worked well. Laura did a good job as the overbearing mother.Julie of course is marvellous as usual. While this movie will keep you laughing most of the time it also has a poignant side to it as it unravels the secrets in the lives of the main characters. Interesting that it was entitled Driving Lessons as this might lead you to believe this is the main feature of the movie which directly it is not though it certainly could be seen as Ben finally being in the driving seat in his own life. Like most things that are funny in life there is always the sad side and there are some moving moments in this movie. Very enjoyable movie and well worth watching.,positive
I watched this film on ITV and I enjoyed it a lot. It was very watchable and very funny. Julie Walters and Rupert Grint were perfect in their roles. Julie Walters gets a special mention since she creates a wonderful diverse interesting character to watch. Ben's character is kinda shy and Stoic but the changes he goes through are wonderfully acted out by Rupert Grint  I would definitely say he has a future in acting after Harry Potter.<br /><br />Laura Linney is quite good in her role as Ben's over protective mother  the only thing they went wrong with is by making her too....Villain-y. Ben's father was also an interesting contrast to his mother  and in the end he is quite honourable too. The only character i wasn't keen on was Bryony  she was a bit plain and unnecessary i thought.<br /><br />Overall this is a great comedy drama that is very easy to watch. one of my favourite films of the year easily.,positive
Driving Lessons sees two middle class quintessential British families meet head on  when Grint's character comes into contact with Evee  (Walters)  a slightly deranged out-of-touch actress with an ego. Grint betrays his overpowering  and over-Christian mother  (Linney)  and goes off travelling with Evee to Scotland  to accompany her on a trip to participate in a Poetry reading  something she claims could be her last  due to an illness.<br /><br />Grint's portrayal of a caged youngster  brainwashed by an overbearing  and even hypocritical mother  is the masterpiece of this film. His portrayal of a downtrodden teen in search of his true morals  and happiness  is captivating to watch unfold throughout. The film is sharply shot  and well paced  with very few moments leaving you tired  an achievement  particularly considering the nature of the plot. Walters really grabs hold of her character with both hands  and successfully brings the audience to her side of things  emphasising Linney's ironic immorality throughout. Her role in Driving Lessons is enjoyable and memorable in every sense.<br /><br />The plot develops nicely  leaving the audience cheering on Grint as he chases back to Evee's place during his lunch break during his stint at a local bookshop to apologise for his wrongdoings. The values in the piece are continued and brought out thoroughly up until the final drag  in a very consistent way. The overbearing  (and relieving)  main idea being that religion doesn't lead to happiness  and certainly doesn't lead to morality.<br /><br />The audience are left sympathising with the radical but lovable Evee  with her and Grint making an irresistible partnership on the big screen  transferred directly from their debut in the Harry Potter series. Charismatic and beautiful acting together with a tight and fact paced script make this a must-see this Christmas.,positive
I wasn't expecting much out of this movie and I was slapped in the face. Julie Walters  Rupert Grint  and Laura Linney perform wonderfully as the main characters in this movie. Any teenager can relate to parental control and the urge to come out as who you really are  which is basically what this movie is about. Ben (Rupert Grint) does this when he meets retired actress Evie (Julie Walters) and begins to express his ideas with words. He slowly but surely breaks out of his shell and becomes much less awkward. Each and every viewer feels the ups and downs of the movie and the theatre is filled with laughter 75% of the time. The film satisfies all  and I hope that soon it might be released in all US theatres  because many do not have the chance to see the film unless they live in big cities. It is a MUST see!,positive
I caught the first screening of Driving Lessons at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows he can act past Harry Potter. Laura Linney is amazing as the overbearing mother. Julie Walters is hilarious as Dame Evie Walton  with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope that this film is picked up by an American distributor so that everyone can see it. This film is not only about Driving Lessons  but life lessons. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between wanting to obey his overbearing mother and vicar father and wanting to live his own life. It's an amazing film  from an amazing director whose taken his own life and put it on the screen for everyone to see  and everyone who can  should.,positive
Driving Lessons From the writer of the critically acclaimed films  Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray  Jeremy Brock brings a touching heartfelt dramedy starring Academy Award Nominees Julie Walters and Laura Linney and from the Harry Potter series  Rupert Grint. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshall  (Rupert Grint) a seventeen year old boy being held captive in the heart of his religiously neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linney). After his school year ends he decides to take a job with a clever  free-spirited  and heavy on the bottle retired actress  Evie Walton (Julie Walters). The pair embarks upon wonderful adventures from camping to walks around the block to the simple conversations about life. Challenging the domineering mother  as well as each other along the way  the two develop a beautiful bond that revolutionizes both their lives.<br /><br />The comedic elements are flawless and precise especially coming from the British veteran  Julie Walters. Brock uses his unique style to create an infamous and loving nature that first time directors could only dream. Directing comes naturally to Brock as he builds up stunning imagery that breaks the surfaces and plunges the viewer down into an overabundance of adoration and creation. Even the subtle score by unknown composers Clive Carroll and John Renbourn accentuate the tone and manner Brock had no trouble in generating.<br /><br />Laura Linney is always making her mark in films as she does as Laura. The bossy and overbearing mother is at times unbearable and with Linney at the helm of it we are engulfed into that persona. The complexity of her character couldn't have been more flawlessly portrayed by anyone else. Rupert Grint breaks away from Ron Weasley and tries on someone new. His performance is more responsive than loquacious but Grint gives us someone brand new to a child performance and the viewer gets to enjoy it. But the standout is coming from Oscar nominated actress Julie Walters who gives Evie a life of her own. Despite the role being clearly a leading one  Walters fairs better in the supporting category where I believe she can simply take home the prize. Evie is a mix of Clementine Kruczynski and Mrs. Laura Henderson with her free spirit and lovable persona. Hopefully her role will not go unnoticed this awards season.<br /><br />Driving Lessons isn't an out of this world experience but a fine  enjoyable one that any viewer could just kick back and learn a little something about life  love  and friendship coming in the forms of the most beautiful colors and sizes.<br /><br />Grade: ***/****,positive
I can't disagree with a previous comment that Driving Lessons is more than a little twee  but one man's indictment is another's endorsement  I suppose. In my book this film succeeds on pure charm  no small feat in itself.<br /><br />I can't help but wish the story was a little less conventional given the amount of acting talent in it  but by the end the plot seems more like a backdrop for the character interactions anyway. Julie Walters' Dame Evie is a gloriously over the top and over the hill actress. Though Evie hasn't had steady work in years  it's unclear the last time she visited reality  if ever (think Edina from AbFab at 65  at one point she is even forced to come to grips with her kitsch-factor). Some may find her annoying  but I think that's the point  to emphasize just how much she pushes the reserved Ben's (Rupert Grint) buttons to force him out of his shell. Ben is equally isolated from reality  living his whole life under the thumb of his overly dependent mother  who Laura Linney manages to breath some life into  despite being a fairly one-dimensional character (ye olde overbearing religious mom). I was rather impressed with Rupert Grint who I found to give a very honest and believable performance (not to mention sweet as all get-out)  I can't think of many teen actors today for whom I can say that.<br /><br />The heart of the movie is what happens when Ben and Evie's worlds collide. At first Ben is understandably tentative  but also intrigued  as Evie is essentially the exact opposite of everything he's ever known. With the combination of Evie's persistence and Ben's helpful nature a genuine sweetness develops between them  culminating in an unlikely road trip that gives Ben his first real taste of independence.<br /><br />The tone is consistently light even through a few brief melodramatic bits  but there was still a surprising amount of emotional resonance  a credit to the main actors. All in all I'd say that if you're willing to sit back and let yourself be charmed by some lovely performances  Driving Lessons shouldn't disappoint. However  if cute is not in your movie vocabulary  best to stay away.<br /><br />One other minor note  the soundtrack features the music of Sufjan Stevens prominently  a nice touch.,positive
I saw this tonight with moderate expectations - if Tartan Films have picked up on something and are releasing it the that's generally a good sign  however I'm not normally a fan of Julie Walters  generally disliking her comedy roles (sorry to any fans  but it's a personal thing - I just don't find her funny in comedy).<br /><br />This was magnificent though - a great performance by all  but Grint and Walters are exceptional! Plenty of laughs  plenty of pathos  great timing and a wonderfully paced film - such a coming of age film wouldn't normally be something I'd expect to like so much but I can't recommend this highly enough - and watch Rupert Grint as he matures into a fine fine actor.,positive
I only heard about Driving Lessons through the ITV adverts  and to be honest  I didn't know how much I would like it. I switched on the TV last night and was totally surprised. Driving Lessons is a modest  simple film which draws you in right from the start. Rupert Grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager Ben brilliantly. He's definitely one to look out for in the future. Dame Eve Walton is played by the fabulous Julie Walters. I loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity. The highlight of the film  for me was Evie's rather colourful poem. It shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs. In my opinion  watching Driving Lessons is a great way to spend 2 hours. The scenery was also striking  especially the countryside. Anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable  I strongly disagree with,positive
A British twist on Harold and Maude  Driving Lessons features a reined-in Rupert Grint and an over-the-top Julie Walters. While it is true that Grint is stone-faced like a redheaded Benjamin Braddock for the first half of the movie  it does not deter from the quirky family film--there are things going on that are out of his character's experience that would create a shell-shocked reaction. The chemistry between Walters and Grint carries the film  though Laura Linney's hard work to make her written stereotype human is also notable. These performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists like Sufjan Stevens  John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica make this kids popcorn flick worth a Saturday afternoon.,positive
I just saw this movie at the Tribeca Film Festival and i have to say that i thought it was amazing. The combination of humor and sincerity really made the movie worthwhile. The movie was about a seventeen year-old boy whose mother and father are very religious. The seventeen year old  Ben  decides to work for a retired actress who teaches him about girls and driving and life. It is very comical and touching. I honestly have to say that it is now one of my favorite movies. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. If you didn't catch one of the showings at the film festival  it's supposed to come out in theaters later in the year. Please go see it! It is a great film.,positive
Well  I'm an Italian horror big fan and I love movies from directors such Argento  Fulci  Bava Sr and Bava Jr  only to quote the most famous. La villa delle anime maledette is one of the most unknown movie of this genre  shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today  and director Carlo Ausino sounds totally new to my ears (althoug he directed six movies... this is the price Italian directors have to pay to not work in Rome...) . But the film is not so bad. And it's absolutely not correct to talk about trash. OK  the plot is not so original; it reminds me stuff like the Amytville series (the year is the same of Amityville Possession by Damiano Damiani) or Shock  the last work of Mario Bava. But you have to think that this is the movie of a cinematographer (like Mario Bava movies); so the most important thing is the atmosphere  not the story or the characters; atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera movement. The rest remain in the background. I think the movie works; not so good  but works; it's surely better than a lot of Hollywoodian production like the Haunting which have a bigger budget  but not bigger ideas...,positive
A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short.<br /><br />Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT (scapegoat) for a dangerous escaped murderer.<br /><br />This is a wonderful  hilarious little film with Keaton at his absolute best. In what is essentially a series of chases  Buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination. Big Joe Roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief.<br /><br />Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats  Buster Keaton (1895-1966) mastered physical comedy at a very early age. An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic  silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928. Writer  director  star & stuntman - Buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience. More akin to Fairbanks than Chaplin  Buster's films were full of splendid adventure  exciting derring-do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable. His theme of a little man against the world  who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity  dominates his films. Through every calamity & disaster  Buster remained the Great Stone Face  a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad.<br /><br />In the late 1920's Buster was betrayed by his manager/brother-in-law and his contract was sold to MGM  which proceeded to nearly destroy his career. Teamed initially with Jimmy Durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies  Buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent. Finally  before lung cancer took him at age 70  he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered. Now  well past his centenary  Buster Keaton is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinema's true authentic geniuses. And he knew how to make people laugh...,positive
Buster Keaton was arguably at his most enjoyable when he did short 20 minute films  and they don't come more rib-ticklingly funny than this gem. The dead pan comic gets involved in a photographic mix-up with a wanted felon. This leads to his elaborate evasion of several street cops and fellow passengers who recognise the his face from the Wanted signs. The Goat is choc-a-bloc with brilliant site gags  from the opening scene at the bread queue  right up to the wonderful elevator chase at the end. A Keaton film never feels as though its silence is lacking  as sound is never something you needed with him. His movies explain themselves through the wonderful (yet incredibly dangerous) things he did to himself. It isn't hard to see just how influential he really was - the man is every bit as thoroughly amazing today as he was in 1921.,positive
This is a wonderful comedy short--one of Keaton's absolute best. Through a long series of silly mistakes  Buster is mistaken for a wanted killer. And  as a result  most of the film consists of him running from the cops and one detective in particular. While generally I am NOT a fan of movies with a lot of chase scenes  this one is the absolute best as far as pure athletic and acrobatic ability. I have seen some that have had wilder stunts  but none where the star was so limber and able to move with amazing grace. In particular  there is a scene where he runs across a table  jumps on a man's shoulders and dives up through the transom as lithely as is humanly possible. Plus so many of the gags are funny and perfectly timed  such as how he really comes to believe that he's actually killed someone. By the way  this film is VERY similar to COPS  also by Keaton  but original enough and with enough energy to make them both worth seeing.<br /><br />This film is brilliant and the only Keaton short I can think of that I probably liked even more was THE PLAYHOUSE--where Buster plays every role at the theater.,positive
Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny'  'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion  'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset  not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion. In a brilliant Disney parody  he hollers Pinocchio down the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. There are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage to begin with  followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'Laugh Clown Laugh' which  as a child  I used to impersonate regularly! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name. I've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but 'Acrobatty Bunny' breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst McKimson's best.,positive
Saw this for the first time on UK TV  with good musical accompaniment. The elevator scene is class  especially when he does the going-down thing in the phone booth  and then fiddles with the floor-indicator. The jump through the transom is really impressive  and there's so much more. Apart from all the stuff that's been mentioned before  there's the fight with the man who's been bullying the woman with the dog - it just looks so simple. The only drawback is the plot - he gets mixed up with Dead Eye Dan  who then escapes but doesn't reappear  even when some more gangsters get involved later on. The scene where it looks like he's shooting at the fat inspector is funny  but would have been better if Dead Eye was the one pulling the trigger.,positive
There is a running thread in film comedy that all the great comics are just falling short of the law or on going to jail. Think of that conman's conman W.C.Fields in THE OLD FASHIONED WAY  or the Marx Brothers in A NIGHT AT THE OPERA  or Chaplin in THE ADVENTURER  of Mae West in SHE DONE HIM WRONG. The skirting of the law is inevitable  and when they end up on the side of the law the results are actually still hostile between the forces of law and order and the comic. Think of Lloyd in his first talkie  WELCOME DANGER  trying to assist the San Francisco Police Department in the midst of a crime wave  and making police sergeant Edgar Kennedy want to kill him. Think of Laurel and Hardy as ill-fated cops in MIDNIGHT PATROL. I find this type of hostility is so patent in all these giants' (and their peers') comedy that even a fake title for a film deals with it. Think of Jerry Seinfeld in one episode of his series creating a Three Stooges short  SAPPY PAPPIES  where the boys end up being electrocuted for murder.<br /><br />Buster Keaton frequently pulls in the forces of law and order to be his opponents in his comedies. Look at STEAMBOAT BILL  JR.  where he tries to spring his dad from a calaboose. But he actually had more conflict from police forces in his shorts. In CONVICT 13 he is dragged back to prison when mistaken for an escaped convict. In COPS (perfect title - if you see it you'd understand) the police force of a large city is repeatedly looking for Keaton  mistaken for a terrorist). And in THE GOAT he is unable to avoid the police for most of the film.<br /><br />Keaton is a tramp just looking for food. But he is totally unlucky. When he sees a stranger throw a lucky horseshoe (which Keaton earlier ignored) over his shoulder  and then find a wallet full of money  Keaton tries the same thing  and hits a cop in the head. The cop gives chase  and Keaton (as luck would have it) runs into another cop  tries to act normal  but ends by throwing the other cop into the path of the first. Soon he has three cops chasing him. Briefly shaking them he walks by a window at the local jail where local murderer Dead Shot Dan (Malcolm St. Clair*) is being photographed. Passing in back of the barred windows  Keaton is stupid enough to stop and look straight in. The desperado notes this and ducks as the picture is taken. When Dead Shot flees the police  it is Keaton's face on all the wanted posters.<br /><br />(*St. Clair would eventually be a successful director of silent and early sound comedies  although in his later biography would be a stint at 20th Century Fox where his work with Laurel & Hardy was below par.)<br /><br />Keaton flees to another town by train (disconnecting the passenger cars containing his pursuers from the locomotive and tender). This is the film (by the way) that has two famous Keaton jokes. His arrival on the locomotive is done in a distant shot  with it coming closer and closer  and suddenly the audience sees Keaton sitting on the cowcatcher. <br /><br />The second famous sequence goes later (and may have influenced Chaplin somewhat in the beginning of CITY LIGHTS). Keaton had accidentally knocked out a man who was arguing too violently with a pretty woman with a dog (Virginia Fox). When he sees the poster's calling him a murderer he thinks he killed the man. He is being chased in this town by a suspicious chief of police (Joe Roberts)  and momentarily loses Roberts in the park. A statue of Man-of-War is being constructed and the sculptor is unveiling a clay model of the horse). Keaton is seen seated on the clay model  trying to maintain his dignity as the clay legs of the horse start collapsing under his weight. <br /><br />Keaton manages to meet the pretty Ms Fox  who invites him home for dinner. Only he doesn't realize her father is Roberts. The last five minutes of the film deal Keaton fleeing and avoiding Roberts while he and Fox get away together.<br /><br />It's a funny comedy  and a wonderful example of Keaton's work at his best.,positive
This is one you can watch over and over and laugh just as much each time. We have been on a Keaton fest around here after purchasing some of his films. In this one Buster is mistaken for an escaped murderer and there are lots of chase scenes and crazy scenes but also what is best about Buster - his creativity. The opening scene is really funny and it just keeps going from there.,positive
To my eternal shame  I've never seen a silent movie - not even the mother of all vampire movies  Nosferatu. However  if they display half the creativity and sheer joy of this effort from Buster Keaton then I'll probably try to watch a few more. This is genuinely funny as well as being a stunning introduction to the world of the silent comedies. The premise  such as it is  focuses around an unfortunate case of mistaken identity as Keaton is mistaken for renowned bad-guy Dead Shot Dan (co-director Malcolm St Clair). This leads to a number of chases and escapes as the authorities get ever closer to the increasingly desperate Keaton.<br /><br />You're left amazed and entertained in equal measures. Keaton is a natural comedian but also an accomplished stunt-man  judging by the way he leaps and jumps around like Jackie Chan on speed. And the comedy is also of an exceptionally high standard - my Better Half had to cut short a phone call to her parents because she was laughing too much! If you've never experienced a silent movie like this then it is nothing short of a revelation to watch - it certainly blew away any ideas I may have had about silent films. Naturally  it isn't as polished as today's movies - the acting is pretty awful  truth be told but that doesn't matter because you're enjoying the movie regardless. Anyone with a passing interest in movies in general should make the effort to watch this because they will not be disappointed. Brilliant!,positive
"Not all  but most of this story is Buster being mistaken for Dead Shot Dan, a notorious criminal. <br /><br />There really is no story  just a series of adventures to show off Buster's physical talents  which are amazing  and his comedic timing. The 27-minute film is basically one adventure after the other mostly involving someone chasing our hero.<br /><br />Earlier  it's a couple of policemen on their beats racing through the streets after Keaton and later it's Big Joe Roberts  a rotund cop - and father a girl Buster is interested in - who chases him. Those latter scenes were the best I thought  with a lot of clever gags involving the hotel elevator where Big Joe and his daughter live. That was Keaton at his best.<br /><br />It's just a madcap half hour that makes little sense  but cares? It's Buster at his slapstick best  or near it  and so it serves its purpose: to entertain us. Just think: 85 years after this film was made there are people (like me) still discovering and enjoying these silent comedy classics! Cool!",positive
This Metro film is episodic  but nearly a constant series of chases  mainly trying to escape police  whether real or imagined  as Buster is mistaken for an escaped criminal. It is consistently inventive and entertaining. Its greatest value is in its documenting what Hollywood looked like in the early twenties  since 95% of it is shot outside among the streets and building exteriors of the time. One gem moment and one gem sequence are present here.<br /><br />The great moment is when a train at a great distance quickly approaches the camera and finally stops just short of it - with Buster glumly sitting on the cowcatcher and thus moving from a long shot to a close-up within seconds.<br /><br />The great sequence is with the phone booth next to the elevator - one constantly being mistaken for the other with races from floor to floor - one of the great Keaton gags.<br /><br />Kino's print is sharp and clear - almost pristine. There is a violin/piano score accompaniment. This is one to seek out and enjoy.,positive
Along with Cops  The Goat is one of Keaton's two funniest shorts. Which makes it one of the best shorts ever made. This has an decent plot for a short  and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags. Keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict (how the mistake happens is a classic) and then must elude the authorities. Best gags - the bread line and t he elevator.,positive
"I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem  except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half-dozen best short comedies ever made. THE GOAT is twenty minutes of smoothly paced  expertly photographed  beautifully executed gags; two reels of non-stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which wasn't always the way with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for one case where Fatalism ultimately got the better of him  or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism.) If I had to describe this film in one word I'd call it effortless, but if I were permitted two I'd call it seemingly effortless, for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease. Still  they didn't call him the Great Stone Face for nothing: Buster never let the public see him sweat.<br /><br />A sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set along Millionaires' Row, i.e. on a bread line in a grim urban setting  where Buster waits patiently at the back of the line and  as a result  doesn't get fed. But it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does he play for pathos; Buster has our sympathy  but he never asks for it. Before long  through a series of accidents  coincidences and absurd misunderstandings  Buster is believed to be an escaped killer named Dead Shot Dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around  and yet while he's clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of self-pity or even surprise; we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him  and that he hasn't time to feel sorry for himself anyway  he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trap.<br /><br />Just as Buster refrains from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either  which is especially impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the most laugh-packed short comedies in existence. This is the film that features that iconic shot of Buster riding a train's cow-catcher right up to the very lens of the camera  which isn't a gag exactly but sure is laugh-provoking in its own strange way. Meanwhile  there are gags involving guns  dogs  cops  an incredibly furry mustache  and a clay statue of a horse that melts under Buster's weight (a surreal sight indeed)  but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the finale when Buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis  Big Joe Roberts  a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady Virginia Fox. Trapped in Big Joe's dining room  Buster leap-frogs over him and sails through a transom  turns a phone-booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear  and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fade-out gag.<br /><br />To say more would be a disservice to first-time viewers. I only wish I could see this film in a theater full of people who'd never seen it before  and float on the laughter. Live musical accompaniment would be nice too; and incidentally the musical score supplied by Kino for their home video/DVD version of THE GOAT is first-rate  serving as icing on an already tasty cake.",positive
Ok i am a huge Traci fan so her just being in the movie automatically makes it rank at the 8.5+ rating. But even besides her being in it i thought it was a good movie especially for it being an HBO movie. But i am afraid if you take Traci out of the movie it would just be ok. But a person can't do that she is in it and she is a wonderful actress. She just keeps getting better and better.,positive
I really like Traci Lords. She may not be the greatest actress in the world but she's rather good in this. She play the dowdy  conservative  reporter to a 'T'. It's a great little thriller which keeps you guessing for a good while. Jeff Fahey is also good as Traci's boss. I think given a decent break Traci could be a top actress. She's certainly no worse than some of today's leading ladies.,positive
Once again  Bugs Bunny sacred home is violated by careless people. This time the traveling circus put a lion's cage right over the rabbit's hole. So Bug's has to come out of the hole and face Nero (that's the name of the lion)  which he does in his usual hilarious style. After a slow and rocky beginning to the cart  it keeps getting better and better and winds up being quite hilarious. Nero the lion turns out to be a pretty good foil for Bugs and that turns this short into a highly memorable one  if still shorn of a classic. This animated short can be found on Disk 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 3.<br /><br />My Grade: A-,positive
A very good offering from HBO. Traci Lords is becoming a much-better dramatic actress with each effort. I hope to see this attractive lady in more challenging roles in the future  instead of the flighty roles she has been stuck with in the past.,positive
Our family (and the entire sold out sneak preview audience) enjoyed The Guardian. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher gave convincing performances as the fictional helicopter rescue swimmer characters Ben and Jake. After seeing this movie  you can't help but imagine how difficult it must be to graduate from the USCG helicopter rescue swimmer school and one day take part in real rescues.<br /><br />Even though this is a fictional movie  it delivered rather convincing virtues of team spirit  dedication and bravery exhibited by all the members of the actual U. S. Coast Guard.<br /><br />The special effects used to create the rescue scenes were incredible. You actually felt like you were taking part in a real rescue.<br /><br />I feel the movie could have been made without the Hollywood bar scene (when you see the movie  you might agree) since the real Coast Guard does not condone such behavior. <br /><br />Very entertaining  very action packed  definitely worth seeing. Thank you  U. S. Coast Guard and the REAL helicopter rescue swimmers  So Others May Live. I'd highly recommend this movie to everyone.,positive
Good Film.<br /><br />I managed to pick this up on DVD in a local store sale. £2.99 seems like a good deal and it is. Thing is the film is named To Kill For. It took a little detective work to find out it's original name.<br /><br />In the UK it has been rated as an 18 and rightly so although the standard of films depends on the ability to sell. Having seen Final Destination 3 last night it  in my view  should have been a 18.<br /><br />Maybe the fact the delightful  Traci Lords is in it tends to make the classification board step it up to 18. Such a shame.<br /><br />Traci is a great actress and should be given the chance to appear in bigger and large budget productions. She ability to turn what is branded a B-Movies into a Fine performance is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />Long Live Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress.,positive
In Extramarital we see B-actress Traci Lords at her very best. She's all wrapped in horror & suspense here  a type of role that suits her very well.<br /><br />This mainstream movie lends a lot of its atmosphere from Paul Verhoeven's 'Basic Instinct' (1992)  by the way. However  there are differences between the main female characters of Traci Lords ('99) and that of Sharon Stone ('92). For instance  in Extramarital Traci adds some tiny elements from her porn-past. We also shouldn't forget mentioning Extramarital's three main actors. By putting down a convincing performance  each of them greatly contributes to the overall quality of this movie. <br /><br />All this makes Extramarital into a very enjoyable B-movie. Its storyline shows a good build-up  its tense being well-spread from start to finish. This movie keeps you at the edge of your seat  until its unexpected end.,positive
The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good  they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp  Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I have seen every actor who's played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov!,positive

Just after having moved into his new cottage in the English country  Hercule Poirot gets an invitation to dinner from Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell  the owners of a large mansion nearby. But the next day  one of the guests is found shot near the pool  and his clumsy wife is holding a revolver a few steps away....<br /><br />This Agatha Christie mystery is somewhat thin  though the killer's plan is still very clever. It's the exquisite filming and cinematography that elevate the story to a higher level. This episode mostly keeps the serious tone of Five Little Pigs and Sad Cypress  but contains more dark humor than them. The cast includes possibly the two most famous actors to have worked in the series by this point  Edward Fox (as the butler) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Angkatell)  though the standout performance is given by the dazzlingly beautiful Megan Dodds as the ahead-of-her-time Henrietta: her one-on-one confrontations with Suchet sparkle and are the highlights of the film. Oh  and since an English police inspector does get involved in the case  I think they could have brought Philip Jackson back for this one. (***),positive
This is an absolutely true and faithful adaptation of 'The Hollow'. It could be argued that the actual mystery here is not one Christie's best but what makes 'The Hollow' special is the characterisation and I found the actors here  more or less without exception  were perfect in their parts. In such a uniformly good cast it's difficult to select stand out performances but I have to say that Sarah Miles is just perfect as Lucy Angkatell. What is extraordinary is that she not only conveys Lucy's dottiness  tactlessness and her more lovable qualities BUT she also manages to pull off the underlying truth that in fact  Lucy is not really all that nice! Megan Dodds is also very good as Henrietta and Claire Price very affecting as Gerda. John Christow is really quite an unlikeable character but Jonathan Cake nevertheless manages to make us see what his women see in him.<br /><br />As I said  the script follows the story quite faithfully. The only disconcerting thing I found was that Midge and Edward's relationship really comes out of nowhere and I do believe that some of it must have ended up on the cutting room floor! Theirs a secondary story however and the primary story is very well done. The whole thing looks beautiful as well  really capturing a perfect English autumn.<br /><br />Its a beautiful film in every respect and well worth seeing.,positive
This movie deserves a 20/10 if I could give one. THE HOLLOW is a great Hercule Poirot novel and the twist at the end fools most people. I am overjoyed that this movie stayed completely faithful to the novel. There was no major difference that I could spot. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into the story earlier that in the novel. The acting was superb  and the music  as usual  was amazing quality! David Suchet is perfect in his role  and the rest of the cast is perfect in their respective roles either. In no other movie that I've seen so far has Poirot been portrayed so brilliantly! Hats off to the producers-- they have made a movie that I along with many others will cherish for a long time to come!,positive
Excellent work all around especially by the actress who played the wife Gerda (Claire Price) as well  of course  as David Suchet. I did really figure out whodunit but that is beside the point. The ending  which I won't divulge (someone describes it on the Board in answer to someone else's question if you are interested.) I found really sad. Despite Agatha Christie's reputation for writing cardboard characters  I thought these really well-rounded by and large.<br /><br />The pacing of the story was good and I enjoyed seeing Sarah Miles as Lucy and Edward Hardwicke (Cedric's son I believe in addition to being a well-known Dr. Watson.)) as her husband.,positive
"The good news is that the circus is in town. The bad news is that's right over Bugs Bunny's underground home. He wakes up as his place shakes like an earthquake hit it  when workers pound stakes into the ground and elephants stomp by  etc.<br /><br />To be more specific  the lions' cage is place exactly over Bugs' hole. The lion sniffs food  and by process of elimination  figures out it's a rabbit. Bugs  curious what all the racket is about  winds his way through the tunnel and winds up in the lion's mouth.<br /><br />I'll say for thing for BB: he is totally fearless  at least in this cartoon  and at least for 30 seconds. When he comes to his senses  he runs like crazy and we get a lion-versus-a rabbit battle the rest of the way. Once again  Bugs faces dumb opponent  one he calls Nero, but lion is fierce and Bugs will need all his wits and somewhat-fake bravado to fend off this beast.<br /><br />About half the gags are stupid and the other half funny  but always fast-moving  colorful and good enough to recommend. I mean  it's not everyday you can see a lion on a trapeze  or doing a hula dance!",positive
In a better civilization  this and many other of the David Suchet movies would be released in theaters. The plots are fabulous (no  I'd no clue who had done it  but the clues were all there if I'd been more imaginative - the best kind of mystery)  the production values astounding  the acting (from Edward Fox  Sarah Miles  Lysette Anthony  Megan Dodds  and of course David Suchet as Hercule Poirot) simply perfect  the dialogue wonderful  the music and sens of suspense and tension just wonderful stuff.<br /><br />One of the pleasures of these Hercule Poirot movies for a man is how many beautiful women star in them! Here were have two - the sexy sinuous Megan Doods and the stunning Lysette Anthony.<br /><br />You really can't go wrong renting these - they're just wonderful - like the most wonderful dinner in the most wonderful restaurant with the most perfect company you can imagine - your mind constantly working because it's all there and you struggle but by keeping your mind constantly thinking can keep up with everything - and the settings gorgeous.<br /><br />I can't think of movies that stimulate thought more than these Hercule Poirot/David Suchet movies. It's impossible to over-praise them - and I had never seen one before a few months ago nor read an Agatha Christie.,positive
The Hollow is a wonderful murder mystery that provides all you can expect from Agatha Christie and of course Poirot. It' s set on a country house on a weekend. As always all the guests are suspects and it's up to Poirot to figure out the truth. With movies like this it's always best not to give too much away so I'll stop here. What I loved in the `Hollow' was that it's a mystery the old fashioned way. When Poirot arrives everybody is around the body for example. Everybody seems to be the culprit. There's that suspicious look and the atmosphere is just perfect for the story.<br /><br />You can expect a wonderful time giving guesses as to whom did it and how and why and maybe in the end even be surprised. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you got a pretty enjoyable experience.<br /><br />The actors are all very good. As a curiosity notice Edward Hardwicke who played Dr. Watson in Sherlock Holmes. Nice to see him after a few years. Suchet is amazing as always and fortunately is on screen most of the time.<br /><br />I did find out who the murderer was but still it's not predictable and It's also very believable.<br /><br />So in conclusion a great movie and as always a pleasure.<br /><br />,positive
i first saw this movie back in the early 90's and instantly fell in love with it.richard benjamin and his wife paula made the 1981 movie saturday the 14thin 1981 prior to making this movie in 1983.i think they work quite well together.this movie made me laugh on several occasions.it also has a young molly ringwald who would later go on in the late 1980's to do movies such as pretty in pink and sixteen candles.it is fun watching her a little younger.although not seen by many people..i don't even think the average movie fan has ever heard of this movie.but when i first came acrossed it i was glad i did.i gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as i think it is a fun movie the whole family can enjoy.lastly i would like to say its not available on DVD so i picked up a VHS copy on ebay so if your interested you probably can find one on there.it might be in the $20-$30 dollar range but i got mind for $12 bucks.i wish they would eventually release this on DVD.,positive
...and I'm so disappointed because I can't seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywhere.<br /><br />Its a kind of mix of  Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager. This was made when Molly was still a brunette  just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy  with an edge! <br /><br />If anyone has a copy of this  or knows where I can get one...please leave a message for me - it'll be much appreciated.,positive
This has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness. When mom and dad both lose there jobs  not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub. They decide it's in their families best interest to move to Oregon. Once there everything goes wrong. An interesting cast of characters compliment this movie. Including a young Molly Ringwald this a movie I would definetly recommend.,positive
The story is about a working girl (Ann Sothern) who has a pretty thoughtless boyfriend (Paul Kelly). This boyfriend is so busy trying to start his own business that again and again he forgets dates or shows up late. The final straw is when Sothern has a birthday and Kelly says he's too busy to take her out to celebrate. So  not wanting to just stay home  she goes on a blind date with what turns out to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks fly but it also becomes apparent after Sothern breaks off her relationship with Kelly that new boyfriend Hamilton is a love 'em and leave 'em sort of guy. How all this is finally resolved is not too difficult to predict--just suffice to say that in the end everything works out just perfectly.<br /><br />This is a very modest little film from Columbia Pictures--with a relatively small budget as well as second-tier stars. It's clearly a B-movie despite there being small roles played by a Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell--as both had yet to become famous. Now this is NOT to say that these are bad actors or the production isn't any good. In fact  given the production values  this is a pretty amazing film as everything seems to work so well despite having a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot outline. That's because the actors and director did a really good job putting the story across. Plus the writers did a good job of humanizing the characters and making you care about them. The ending  in particular  is really sweet and practically had my tear ducts flowing! Because of these factors  the film earns a 7 of 10.,positive
Blind Date is one of three stories-made-into-movie by author Vida Hurst. Lots of familiar faces in this oldie from 1934. Mickey Rooney as a mouthy little punk. He seems to be in the film for comedic and homey family values. Jane Darwell again plays the strong-willed mother  just as she had in Grapes of Wrath and the Oxbow Incident. Ann Sothern is Kitty  who has been dating Bill (Paul Kelly)  but meets up with rich Bob Hartwell  played by Neil Hamilton  who may or may not be better for her. You can certainly tell that this was made at the very beginning of the Hays production code -- at one point  Kitty says she can't be up there alone with him if there isn't anyone else in the house...what a change from just a year or two prior  when anything and everything was OK. Good solid plot  but a whole lot of conversation and mushy love talk. It raises the question over what a girl should be searching for in a man; should she hold out for a man with integrity who treats her nice  or just find a man with big bucks  as most of the movies from the previous 20 years had advocated...? and how do men change when their situation changes ? watch out for some violence in the strange dance marathon scene. TV viewers from the 1960s will recognize Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon from Batman..... Also some weird drama in the off-screen lives for some of the cast in this one --Paul Kelly had gone to jail for being accessory to murder in a love triangle. Mickey Rooney had an affair with Norma Shearer  who was 20 years older; Rooney ended up being married eight times. Tyler Brooke (Emory) and Spencer Charters (Pa) both knocked themselves off in real life. The title Blind Date has been reused many times  for films  TV series  and even cartoons  but none of them seem to have the same plot as this one.,positive
Working girl Kitty (Sothern) is engaged to Bill (Kelly)  who neglects her by working long hours at his garage in order to save money for their marriage. After being stood up on her birthday  Kitty goes on a double-date/blind date  where she meets department store heir Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). She falls in love  but leaves him when his protestations of love appear to cover a desire for her to be his mistress  rather than his wife. Faithful Bill rallies 'round to comfort her  and at last she gives in to his repeated requests to reinstate their engagement  pressured in part by Bill's support of her family after she loses her job. When Bob returns  however  convinced that he wants marriage after all  will Kitty follow her heart or her conscience? <br /><br />This film was a lot better than I'd expected it to be. The character of Bill at first comes off as the sort of loud comic Irishman type that Jack Carson played so often. But Kelly (and the script) infuse the character with real compassion and love  and Bill turns out to be the best person in the entire group. Viewers may find themselves rooting for him against the feckless Hartwell! The tone of the film wavers  however  between light-hearted romance and a much darker side  especially in the depiction of a dance marathon and a rather horrific accident at Bill's garage.<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by the dependable Jane Darwell as Kitty's mother  an impish but not yet thoroughly obnoxious Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother  and Spencer Charters as Kitty's ne'er-do-well father.,positive
I saw this movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He prefaced it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation  it was HILARIOUS. I can see how it would be damaging to some audiences  and the subject is not funny at all  but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard I thought I'd pee. They don't come until after the halfway point  but when they do  oh God...you will die. Oh and Jim Brown is brilliant. He's not in a lot of the movie  but when he's there  you know whose movie it is. Naturally  the best line in the movie (and the funniest) is his; you'll know it when you hear it.,positive
This film essentially contains all the elements of a great 70's exploitation film  except it was done in the late 80's for the direct to video market.<br /><br />You have a young couple in love  but the whole world around them is involved either in crack dealing or gang violence. When the boyfriend goes to jail  the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals  who are everyone in this movie except for the cops. First she gets hooked on crack by a dealer and then because he owes drug lord Jim Brown money  she becomes Brown's property. Then she's basically enslaved in a military style crack house that the movie is named for.<br /><br />As if this isn't enough reason to see this movie  you also have Anthony Geary playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor  but he's really a major crack dealer. In a sleazy yet hilarious scene  he demands sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a fix. In an earlier scene it was established that he is her counselor. That scene and another where Jim Brown forces her to take a scalding hot shower because she stinks are hysterical. Lead actress Cheryl Kay was really good in this film. Tarantino  bring her back.<br /><br />It's not surprising to me that someone mentioned in another review that Tarantino is a major fan of this. It has just the right blend of comedy  action  sex  romance  and yes a central message to stay away from drugs. Jim Brown's villainous turn here deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as another great 80's B villain  Wings Hauser in Vice Squad. Sometimes I think there should be a b movie Oscars where performances like this could be acknowledged. In the meantime let's hope that the modern straight to DVD filmmakers learn learn to use this same type of tongue in cheek humor.,positive
Crack House (1989) was one of the few film during the 80's that falls into this genre. What's supposed to be an anti-drug film turns out to be nothing more than some white-exploitation exercise in depravity. There's nothing wrong with that however. The video presentation even has an anti-drug message from one of the stars of the show Richard turncoat Roundtree <br /><br />The movie follows two young lovers in high school. One of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl. One of them get's turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at his ex-friends. Jim Brown appears as the movie's Mister Big  he's one bad dude who still can punk-out anybody and is a very sadistic guy who likes to smack his hoes and beat the tar out of those who try to defy his word. Luke from General Hospital makes a guest star spot as well.<br /><br />If you like hard edge sleaze then this movie's for you. Sadly  Hollywood doesn't make these any more and when they do  it's neither exploitative nor entertaining.<br /><br />Recommended for sleaze fans.,positive
A savage  undisciplined lion has been put behind bars for a circus carnival. He suddenly notices a hole on the floor of his cell  then sticks his nose into this hole to snuff it. At first he thinks Bugs Bunny's home is belong to a camel; yet when he wakes Bugs up from his sleep hoisting him up to the ground  there he meets with Bugs  his next trainer. <br /><br />If you ever wonder how Bugs would turn a savage lion into a Hawaiian hula dancer with traditional skirts on  you should watch this cartoon. Director Bob McKimson offers endless laughters by means of absurd and unexpected demonstrative humour. <br /><br />The signature scenes include:<br /><br />1/ the look of Bugs Bunny's home  cross-referencing to Donald Duck with the B.B. name acronym on the headboard of Bugs's bed <br /><br />2/ Bugs Bunny's short journey with the mine hoist climbing up to the ground floor <br /><br />3/ When Nero the Lion calls his friend the Elephant for help  Bugs uses a toy mouse to scare the Elephant; since the Elephant needed a broom to outpower that toy mouse  he uses Nero as a broom! <br /><br />4/ Bugs becoming a clown with the proper costume and make-up and the practical clown jokes that he makes <br /><br />5/ the trapeze scene while Nero chasing after Bugs <br /><br />6/ the famous Human Cannonball scene after which Nero the Lion starts dancing Hawaiian Hula<br /><br />The magic moments which keep Acrobatty Bunny fresh at all times in our memory:<br /><br />1/ When Bugs comes out of his bunny hole  he thinks he's in the Pinocchio tale; and starts acting to save Pinocchio out of the giant whale's stomach <br /><br />2/ When the Lion roars to scare him  Bugs replies back to him with roaring<br /><br />3/ Bugs arguing with the Lion for he's making so much noise  then finding a piece of wood to rub it against the iron bars while singing in order to make more noise than him <br /><br />4/ Wearing rubber heels at the circus  Bugs starts to bounce like toy rabbits and causes Nero to bounce! <br /><br />Those are the 10 main reasons that keeps Acrobatty Bunny as a Bugs Bunny classic and can be found in the Bugs Bunny Classics' MGM/UA Video (1989),positive
"When I first got wind of this picture  it was just called Shepherd and was supposed to be the film that would put JCVD back into chances of doing theatrical shtuff. I was very well excited about the whole piece.<br /><br />By the time it was titled The Shepherd: Border Patrol, I was tap-dancing in excitement for this flick. With Isaac Fluorentine at the helm of directing  and JJ Perry pulling stunt coordination  I almost peed me pants in anticipation. Pics were released of JCVD kicking 8 different kinds of arse as well as Scott Adkins playing what I thought was the villain  and I was mind-blown in excitement. I thought it was going to be another epic martial arts situation like Lone Wolf McQuade.<br /><br />Then it came out. I ordered it off Blockbuster online for $20 and was ready for anything. The reviews from vandammefan.net kinda had my ideas alittle altered  but I braced myself. The mail came on day 4 and I ripped open the package. My initial plan was to rush upstairs  rip the face off the cardboard packaging  then smash the case in the proper dynamics so the disc would land in my DVD player. However  I stared at the case for 10 minutes then placed the disc in my player and watched the film.<br /><br />By the time it was over  I was cool as a fool in the pool. The Shepherd is certainly one of my all-time favorite direct-to-video films ever and makes Derailed look like even more of the toilet mess that it is. Sure  some of the fights ran a twee bit short  but they were still VERY awesome. The shootouts were superb  as was Scott Adkins  who SHOULD have been the villain  unlike the forgettable Steven Lord.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flick. Seriously.",positive
When the circus comes to town and places the lion's cage directly over Bugs Bunny's home  Bugs ends up somewhere in the range right between freaked out and intrepid. Despite the title Acrobatty Bunny  it's only at the end when Bugs and the lion perform acrobatics. But even leading up to that  it's quite funny what Bugs does to escape getting eaten; somehow  he always manages to use the other character's weakness against him  and then pull any convenient object out of thin air! Bugs later ended up in the circus in Big Top Bunny. I liked this one better  as the latter got drug down a little bit by giving the antagonist an Eastern European accent (I know that it was during the Cold War  but still). I recommend this one.<br /><br />And with the end  we can affirm that it'll never be Aloha Oe for this cartoon.,positive
Van damme has done some great films over the years and this one hits a big ten in my books. From the setting of Mexico to the five star fight scenes  this movie was amazing. The film is all about border patrol officers protecting there territory which is the border of Mexico. Ex navy seals are smuggling drugs out of Mexico into the united states of America (USA)  Van damme and Scott Atkins give stunning performances as the cop and the villain. Although this film wasn't as good as until death but it still gave the action acting and the film a five star look. I always look forward to these b grade action films and they keep getting better. keep them coming van damme.<br /><br />Watch this film if you enjoyed films like - Until death  The hard corps and second in command.,positive
This movie was made on a relatively small budget (10-20 million dollars?) with almost no promotion at all from its distributors. I only knew about it because I am a long time Jean-Claude Van Damme fan and I always check out his latest films in hope that they will be at least watchable and aside from some real turkeys (Derailed  Second In Command)  they are. This movie has an easy enough plot to follow and Van Damme gives a good  humorous performance through out but the movie owes all of its credit to the fight scenes involving Van Damme  Scott Adkins and the final one of them together. The editing and camera work for most of the film is pretty terrible but Isaac Florentine can definitely film a good fight scene. I too am happy that Van Damme has been acting better lately (In Hell  Wake of Death  Until Death) but with the good acting came less martial arts. In The Shepherd  Van Damme proves that he still has it.,positive
I like the shepherd! Sure the acting wasn't good but the fight scenes were nice. Van damme throws some nice kicks and so does adkins. The story was average. A Texas cop battles smugglers. This movie did everything a van damme movie should do which is martial arts and action. Van damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than van dammmes last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar winning performance you're not gonna get it here but if you're looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you. Scott adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars but his movies in this movie are great. Van damme delivers strong kicks and it's good to see him performing martial arts again since he has not in his last 4 or 5 movies. This movie is definitely worth watching if you're a van damme fan.,positive
I have not seen a Van Damme flick for a while  pleasantly surprised  he still has it  looking older  but tougher  kind of like Sly  becomes more rugged with age. This is a good flick and has prompted me to take a look at all the Van Damme movies I have missed over the last ten years. I would like to see a good director put Van Damme on the big screen with a good plot. Van Damme still has the moves to amaze the audiences  the last movie viewed with Van Damme was Legionnaire  that was a good flick as well. In addition  I looked in to Van Damme's early fighting history  I too my amazement I realized he is the real deal  very accomplished martial artist in his younger years.,positive
After 10 years  it is finally save to say that our Belgian Action Star is back again. I personally found this one to be even better than Wake Of Death  which makes it his best movie in... 10 years!! Okay  it is not like his highlight years as Timecop  Universal Soldier  Sudden Death or even his best effort to date: Hard Target (one of the best action movies ever made by one of the best action directors John Woo.) The Action is good  the story is exciting  the dialogue is quite funny  this one is better than expected.The bad guys are awesome like in Hard Target  and the fight scenes are old school. Real fans know what to expect. I must say  I gave up on him  but Van Damme is finally back. More Please....,positive
Like Steven Seagal I also am a big Van Damme fan and have followed most of his movies since the start of his acting career.<br /><br />In this flick Van Damme assumes the role of Jack Robideaux whom is a cop that just moved to New Mexico from New Orleans to work as part of the Border Patrol. Haunted by memories of his past  it is up to Jack to put an end to a group of Ex-Navy Seals from smuggling illegal drugs into the U.S. that killed his daughter.<br /><br />Overall I found this film to be very good  Van Damme is in very good shape for 48 years old and can really move. The action scenes are very intense and the movie even throws a couple of plot twists in to keep you guessing. Unfortunately Van Damme does not have the same intensity as he did say 10 years ago  regardless The Shepherd: Border Control is the 3rd straight solid film that Van Damme has made possibly opening the door for a larger project.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this movie to a Van Damme fan or fan of action movies in general; The Shepherd: Border Control is a great movie  not as good as Until Death but better than the Hard Corps. Be sure to give this one a try  you will not be disappointed.,positive
I thought that this was the most interesting film that JCVD has done in a very long time. I loved his character and the whole thing with the rabbit set a different tone for this film. IMHO  JCDV may really be on to something going forward. A little more light heartedness  some obvious homages to other films  mixed in with some great fights...I would like to see more this style of film-making from him. One of the other posters thought that the bar scene was a Desperado rip off. I immediately saw the R. Rodriguez connection also  but thought it was very clever and made me want to see the film again to look for more subtle cues from other films. JCVD rocks!!<br /><br />Other stuff after reading other comments:<br /><br />No music in the dungeon fight? At first I didn't like that at first either  but then I thought it was interesting because it threw me off balance a bit by giving us something that we didn't expect. Made it seem more real.<br /><br />I also always get a laugh when directors cry like 2 year olds that their film was stolen from the studio. Directors are paid to do a job. The studio is the boss and they want the product that they want. Very few directors have absolute final cut on a film. In this case  JCVD is THE talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film. I am sure he got a film that he was happy with. I have a relative who works at a post house who knew a little of the story. PRESUMABLY  the director worked on and delivered his cut of the film. Everyone who saw it said it was a disaster...then JCVD and the studio re edited the movie. This stuff happens all the time. He also did see the final cut (which he claims he didn't) and his delicate genius ego was severely bruised because they hated his delivered cut. If this director was smart  he should have taken credit for this one as it would have been his best.,positive
It's really good to see Van Damme's film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to C-grade flops Derailed and Second in command which were both tragic and not in a good way. The Sheperd: Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great action/fight sequences. It's good to know that Van Damme still knows how to kick seeing as his last film Until Death had no martial arts in it at all!!!<br /><br />That being said  this film is significantly inferior to Until Death which was a really good turn for Van Damme. Until Death lacked the over-the-top action of most Van Damme films but was dark and gritty and Van Damme's performance as an actor was surprisingly good in that film. Still  The Shepherd is definitely a film worth checking out especially for Van Damme fans or just action movie fans in general but if you're looking for a film with a bit more story line.....you may want to skip this one!<br /><br />I do believe that this film was done well enough especially on what little budget it would have been shot on. The only real problem I have with this film is the title; The Shepherd? I don't get it! I suppose Border Patrol just doesn't have the same ring to it without the word Shepherd in front of it!!!<br /><br />My rating for this film is 7 out of 10 but that's by Van Damme movie standards not in any other film category.<br /><br />i.e. It's good for a Van Damme film.,positive
Well...it's about time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that's his best film in recent years. The plot isn't too inventive but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the ex-marines as drug smugglers twist is cool. But what makes this movie awesome is the fact that Van Damme is back to doing martial arts again. His latest films have been more acting oriented  but in The Shepard  JCVD is back to dropping the bad guys and looks to be in excellent shape. There are some impressive fight scenes and Van Damme shows he can still pull out the old famous 360-spinning heel kick. For being a low-budget action movie  it does have good sets and great stunts. Van Damme says some humorous lines and shows that he's improving as an actor. I'm glad he's back to dealing out some Van Damage...i've been let down by the lack of fighting in his recent films. Scott Adkins is great in his role and Van Damme and him have a 1 on 1 showdown at the end. Overall  it's one of Van Damme's better films and it will keep you entertained. A must rent for JCVD fans. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed for another martial arts epic like Bloodsport or Kickboxer. Nok Su Kow!,positive
I enjoyed it. There you go  I said it again. I even bought this movie on DVD and enjoyed it a couple of more times. Call me old fashioned but I prefer movies like this to garbage like Die Hard 4 which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving America. Van Damme moves well for a guy of his age(47 I think)  delivering kicks that reminds one of Kickboxer. If you like old school action and and explosions  this is the movie to watch. This is one of Van Damme's best works.<br /><br />Van Damme and Steven Seagal movies get released theatrically where I live so I never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen.,positive
Channel zapping one night I just caught the start of this movie and it hooked me from the beginning. It tells the sad story of an adopted child  Adam  whose mother left him after birth. The movie takes us through his childhood  and makes us discover a very disturbing fact from Adam's past. I will not reveal more  but it is a very in-depth movie and will intrigue you for sure. This was one of Jimmy Smits best roles in my opinion.,positive
This is the best direct-to-DVD effort from Van Damme that I have seen yet. Van Damme plays a border patrol agent who is out to stop heroin smugglers trying to cross into the United States. The action in this movie is great and the fight scenes rank with Van Damme's best. Costar Scott Adkins shows why he should be the next big star in the martial arts genre. For further evidence check out Undisputed 2. Adkins is so good in fact that before I watched The Shepherd  I thought that Van Damme might not look very believable in defeating him on screen. Van Damme holds his own though and although he isn't quite as athletic as Adkins is  he can still kick with the best of them. All of the fight scenes in this film are very well done and the gun battles are above average for this type of film as well. The only negative thing I can say about this movie is that the story is a little underdeveloped. I think Van Damme's character's motives should have been presented earlier in the movie  especially in regard to why he carries around a rabbit. The reason he does is very cool but you don't find out until the very end. There are a couple of other things that are never really explained either but this is a Van Damme movie so you know where the priority lies in making this kind of movie and it ain't character development. Overall though  this is a solid action movie that I recommend. So run for the Damme border!,positive
This film is good in it's genre and that genre is naturally action with a little/average budget. Looks like Van Damme delivers greatly better performances when he has a good director guiding him. There is your basic bar brawl  alley scene and mostly a lot of gun fighting. Some basic drama  but nothing too deep. Isaac Florentine directs an OK action flick if you ignore the weak plot and the holes in it. But the person who steals the show is: <br /><br />Scott Adkins. How come this guy isn't a massive Arnold Schwarzenegger caliber action star that I don't know. Director Isaac Florentine has made a movie with Scott Adkins before called Special Forces (2003) which has some unbelievable martial arts talent that will satisfy the most demanding kungfu enthusiastic. Another amazing Scott Adkins feature is Undisputed 2. Check this guy out and make a noise  this guy needs to get super action star status and he needs to get it now!<br /><br />What else can I say about the movie? It's Van Damme stepping up a notch from some of his most recent work. No Oscars here for sure  but you already knew that. But never the less it has a nice little town feel and I could find worse ways to spend my time. So I'm giving this a solid 7 out of 10 in it's genre.,positive
"After seeing Undisputed 2  I knew what to expect from Isaac Florentine.<br /><br />The Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent flick (not Van Damme's best  but definitely not his worst.) There is some bad acting from VD's supporting cast  but it makes sense.<br /><br />The storyline and plot has all been done before  so it's nothing new. I mean this is Van Damme. We don't really expect much of an amazing plot do we? So lets talk about what we all want to watch this movie for anyway: the fighting.<br /><br />Without giving anything away  I thought the way the fights were filmed and shot were well done  way better than a few of VD's recent movies such as Second in Command  in which the entire end fight is HORRIBLE. With Florentine behind the camera  and if you've seen Undisputed 2  he seems to know how to photograph fights and enjoys it. A few of the fights in The Shepherd reminded me of VD's older stuff which is what we all want to see. The fights were good  and i said hah, awesome out loud a few times. But I was hoping for just a bit more considering how good I thought Undisputed 2 was.<br /><br />Something I found intriguing was VD's daughter in the film  I thought wow she's kinda hot come to find out  its Bianca Van Varenberg  JC's real life daughter. I have never seen her before so that was a nice treat.<br /><br />All in all  this movie is not half bad. Yeah the story has been done before but at least JC was attempting to make a good movie. Next time though  add more hand to hand combat! I think He still has what it takes to do another big budget movie...his acting has improved since he's been doing DTV's and he really is in great shape at 47. I don't know about you but I'm one of the ones who thinks that most of his DTV's are actually good with the exception of Derailed. All he needs to do is get back into bloodsport shape  and make a martial arts movie...and I think people would respond well even though he's not jet Li. This movie is definitely worth the rental. =)",positive
Well it is a good movie. However  you have to admit that Van Dame's movies haven't been so great lately. On the other hand if you are a hardcore van Dame fan you should watch this as there is a huge improvement with fighting scenes. Also What i really liked is the music beautiful music. am sure this will kill time if you are action fan. As for Isaac Florentine the director of Undisputed 2  i don't think he did a good job as he did with Undisputed.I cant wait when one day Van Dame's movies hit the cinemas before the DVD. Maybe  one day:).<br /><br />In the end it worth the watch if you got no other action movies to watch  this could make your hour and half fun.,positive
The original Female Convict Scorpion is an all time masterpiece. The first sequel  Jailhouse 41  was not quite as good in my opinion  though it's still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film; the story is a bit different here  but still he's managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. Again the action focuses on Nami Matsushima (a.k.a. Scorpion) and this time she's out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the idea of going back. After escaping from pursuing police officers  one thing leads to another and Scorpion finds herself getting it together with a prostitute and her retarded brother. The prostitute ends up getting impregnated by the retarded brother (...)  while Scorpion is kidnapped and caged up by someone who she made an enemy out of in prison. But Scorpion doesn't like spending time behind bars and it's not long before she's back to doing what she does best.<br /><br />The film gets off to a great start as we see Scorpion hack the arm off a copper intent on taking her back to jail. From there  however  the film slows down a lot and Beast Stable ends up being more of a drama than the previous two films. That's not to say that there isn't still plenty of action - Scorpion still spends a lot of time in 'revenge mode' and the film isn't exactly short on general sleaze. Meiko Kaji once again reprises her role as the sinister title character and it's another understated  almost wordless performance. Her screen presence is great  however and she manages to have a menacing presence despite being only small physically. The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all builds into a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this film than in the previous two so this section takes up a fairly large part of the film. There's a few surreal sequences  not as many as in the first film and nowhere near as in the second  but the film stays in with the rest of the series on that point. Overall  I would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality - not as great as the original and slightly better than the second.,positive
Since the past couple of days I'm really hooked on the Female Scorpion series and I keep hitting myself over the head because I waited until now  which is way too long  before purchasing the whole box set. Beast Stable is the third brilliant effort in a row  and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment. Never before  or after  has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines  settings  themes and filming styles. The original more or less qualified as a so-called Women-in-Prison flick (but already an atypical one)  but you can't possibly categorize parts 2 and 3 as such  since they hardly feature any footage within prison walls. And the overall tone and atmosphere keeps changing with each new episode as well. The first film was harsh and gritty  whereas the second was psychedelic and part three is almost mainly melodramatic. Don't let this last description discourage you  however  as Beast Stable still features more than enough exploitative themes and disturbing footage in spite of the dramatic ambiance. The opening sequence  for example  is downright fantastic. Sasori  still a fugitive from the law  literally chops her way to freedom on the subway when there's no other possibility than to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman that handcuffed her. Her run through the city with the cut-off arm dangling on hers while the credits appear on screen  accompanied by the familiar theme song  is just pure and genuine exploitation gold! The story compellingly continues with our heroine desperately trying to lead an anonymous life in the big city  but the poor thing simply can't escape her past or even new types of agony. Sasori befriends a prostitute  though without exchanging dialog  and takes on a job in a sewing atelier. Her own retarded brother (!) impregnates the prostitute  while Sasori gets in trouble with the local pimping and underground crime network. She cleverly prevents a thug from taking advantage of her body  encounters a former enemy from prison and furiously avenges one of the prostitutes when she gets submitted to a barbaric abortion. Meanwhile  the one-armed cop continues to obsessively prowl the streets  looking for retribution against Sasori. Our multi-talented director Shunya Ito formidably criss-crosses all these story lines to a powerful wholesome and never once loses grip on the visual aspects or ingenious filming style. Beast Stable features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine  the editing is flawless and the exterior locations are effectively depressing. Those who know Sasori's character a bit are aware that the film seriously lacks memorable dialogs  but this always gets widely compensated with Meiko Kaji's wondrous on screen charisma and menacing grimaces. There's very little sleaze  apart from the aforementioned incestuous sub plot  but the brief flashes of extreme violence are terrific and the twisted ending is almost too brilliant for words. In fact  I think part three might just be the greatest (or at least  my favorite) one of the series so far. My only small and totally irrelevant point of criticism is regarding the ridiculous sounds one of the birds produces when Sasori is locked up in a cage. That bird sounds like a ventriloquist's dummy with stomach cramps.,positive
After finishing the Zero Woman series  I was looking forward to the Female Prisoner Scorpion series; both based upon comics by Tooru Shinohara. Unfortunately  I was not able to see them in order  as this is the third in the series.<br /><br />It starts great as The Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) is escaping from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) did manage to get a cuff on her  but she proceeded to cut off his arm and get away. If that isn't bad enough  later on a dog digs up the arm and is seen trotting down the street before finding a place to enjoy his treat.<br /><br />Scorpion might as well go back to prison as life is no picnic on the outside. First  a local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to put her back if she doesn't put out; and then the gang leader gets her when she gets rid of Tanida. But  they don't hold her for long before she escapes and is looking for vengeance.<br /><br />Soon they are dropping like flies. Some certainly deserved it for wearing garish outfits with shirt collars so big they went all the way to the shoulder. The madam (Reisen Lee) turns herself in to avoid getting killed.<br /><br />The police arrive at her latest kill and trap her in the sewer. She's in there for a week and the cops find out that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) has been supplying her with food. (The story O Yuki (Watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting  but only incidental to the movie.) They try to burn her out  but this is The Scorpion  and she has some unfinished business.<br /><br />Not the usual mix of sex and violence  this is a slow tale that is beautiful throughout.,positive
There's hell to pay when you cross Nami Matsushima(Meiko Kaji)  Female Scorpion  and a dangerous group of thugs(..including their sadistic head pimp and his equally repellent lady)  operating a prostitution ring with an iron fist  does just that. Hell hath no fury like Scorpion  and a determined detective  Gondo(Mikio Narita)  seeking revenge for decapitating his arm after handcuffing her  will do whatever it takes(..and that includes intimidating anyone who might know her whereabouts)to catch Nami. Nami finds an ally in hooker Yuki(Yayoi Watanabe)  who provides her a temporary shelter. Yuki has a retarded brother who suffered a brain injury during a job  and must take care of him(..in a disturbing revelation  regarding incest  she also provides his sexual needs!)..she  in actuality  keeps him locked up in a room while working the streets! Meanwhile  Nami is targeted by a vile neighbor once she finds a place of her own(..she works as a sewer)  and he threatens to turn her into the authorities(..Nami was an escaped convict  who fled a subway from the cops)if she doesn't supply him sexual favors. His wife dumps a tea kettle of boiling water all over his face and body  resulting in death  & the prostitution clan come looking for Nami to pay the debt of losing a very important member of their organization. That's when Katsu(Reisen Lee)  the pimp's lover and confidant  realizes that the one responsible for the loss of their loyal member is a former inmate of hers  Scorpion. Subduing her with an injected liquid drug  placing her in a bird cage(!)  Katsu embellishes in her imprisonment. What ultimately fuels Nami's rage is watching a prostitute die outside her cell  a victim of a forced late-term abortion  left to bleed to death. Finding a scalpel clutched in her hand(..from the operation room)  Nami will break free from the cage and prey upon each member of the clan responsible for the hooker's death. The series of scalpel murders provide Gondo with an opportunity to catch Nami  and he'll trap her in the underground sewers below the city  but can he catch or kill her? Especially if Yuki comes to her aid?<br /><br />Trust me when I say there was no shackles binding director Shunya Ito or his film-making team because FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION:BEAST STABLE is yet another perverse  deranged  and ultra-violent entry in the very entertaining series. Equipped with fine production values and a visually stylistic talent for capturing all of the madness in imaginative ways  Ito pulls you right(..or he did me)into the twisted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima is on screen. When you have a protracted opening credits sequence where your anti-heroine is fleeing through the crowded city streets with a man's severed arm handcuffed to her  the viewer has to know what they're in for! The incestuous sub-plot is simply bizarre(..and it's shot in a soft-core way with the retarded brother humping his numb  cold sister with dead eyes staring ahead!)  and the entire abortion sequence is rather hard to sit through. But  the abortion angle  as disturbing as it is  provides motivation for Nami's revenge..despite Nami's imperfect ways  and her criminal nature  you would rather see her take these cretins out than vice versa. Interesting angle with Detective Gondo  as well. Gondo is willing to break the rules  and he becomes a force-of-nature towards anyone who stands in his way of capturing his mortal enemy. His fate at the end  visiting another enemy of Nami's  in an isolated cell  while she looks on  perfectly encapsulates what makes these films so ridiculous yet so entertaining. The scalpel murders is a montage of slumping scumbags  in various places  the blades protruding from flesh  with Nami leaving the crime scenes very driven to wipe the whole clan out in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances. While the film is essentially a comic book adventure  there's a sadness that permeates  and few characters come away without flaws. I imagine many will walk away from this scoffing at how unrealistic FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION:BEAST STABLE is(..specifically how Nami is able to escape capture time and time again  accomplishing her goals of revenge  paying back all those who have wronged her)  but I looked at it as a violent action cartoon  much like the later 80's films  and enjoyed it for what it was. As always  this film features some beautiful Asian actresses and some colorful heavies. Meiko Kaji  almost always reserved/quiet  yet chilly staring down her enemies with violent intent  is in fine form(..in more ways than one)and Reisen Lee  as her cross-eyed  repugnant adversary  runs away with the picture as a perfectly realized contemptibly abusive foe worthy of psychological torment(..when both are in prison  Nami's ways of torturing her are sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot  but is so wonderfully wrong  features a dog discovering Gondo's rotted severed arm  walking through a street eventually finding a resting place to chew on it!,positive
The third and final Female Prisoner Scorpion film directed by Shunya Ito. The series' star  Meiko Kaji  would complete the series in the fourth installment  Grudge Song  directed by the capable Yasuhara Hasebe (who also directed Kaji in the excellent Stray Cat Rock: Sex Hunter). The original Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion is one of my all-time favorites. The sequel  Jailhouse 41  is nearly as good. It's generally considered the best of the series  and I might agree  I think  if it ever gets a better release on DVD (the original  by Image  is very poor). Beast Stable  in my opinion  is nearly as good as FP701. It's much slower  much more contemplative. It has its share of violence and nastiness  but there's more focus on the story and the characters. Sasori (Kaji) eludes detectives in the first scene (she is handcuffed to one and lops his arm off  and escapes with it in tow  which must be seen to be believed!) and hooks up with a freelance prostitute  Yuki. Yuki is being hassled by a local prostitution ring  which includes a goofy-looking madame with a cage full of pet crows. What really surprised me is how sad the movie is. Yuki's story  which is never resolved  it heartbreaking. The images are startling  and Ito's direction is masterful. It's too bad that he never went anywhere after he left the FP701 series. This is an awesome film.,positive
Many consider BEAST STABLE to be the last of the true FEMALE PRISONER films  as it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito  and is followed by one other film (GRUDGE SONG) by a different director. I have not seen GRUDGE SONG yet (but soon will...) so I don't know how it stacks up to the previous FP films - but it will be interesting to see. The way BEAST STABLE ended didn't really leave a lot of room for another predecessor - but I guess I'll find out...<br /><br />This entry has Scorpion on the run from the cops  where she hooks up with a street-hooker who ends up pregnant with her retarded brothers child (oh yeah - that's no lie...gotta love these sleazy story lines). Scorpion ends up being kidnapped by an old rival  but (as she is so good at...) ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people that wronged a few of her hooker friends...<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers  that this one is a little slower at points and more serious then the previous two entries. The story is somewhat confusing and convoluted at times  but a lot of these 70's era pinky films are - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE is lacking pretty badly in the nudity area which was pretty disappointing - but I thought it strong in other areas - storyline  cinematography  some good sleaze etc...Definitely worthwhile to fans of this sort of thing  or who have enjoyed the other FEMALE PRISONER films...8/10,positive
A very good film  focusing on a very important issue. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth defect that is totally preventable. If more families saw this film  perhaps more children would not end up like Adam. Jimmie Smits performs in one of his best roles ever. This is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs. This is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the United States today. There are children struggling with this world wide. The really important point here is that it all could have been prevented. More people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously. It is well done  with important messages  handled in a graceful way.,positive
Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable  the third in the series  is a magnificent piece of pulp sleaze. Closer in tone and subject to a Nikkatsu violent pinker than other Scorpion entries  it is stunningly photographed  directed with lurid enthusiasm  and populated with a rogue's gallery of villains and degenerates. Shinya Ito  the director of the first installment  returns for this surreal fable which begins with Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) cutting the arm off a cop she is handcuffed to and fleeing into the Tokyo subway with said arm still swinging from her wrist. She takes refuge in a red light district where she befriends a prostitute  who is first seen seen having incestuous intercourse with her brother (who ends up impregnating her). Scorpion's desire to protect this unfortunate woman eventually exposes her identity and all hell breaks loose. She is beaten  sexually assaulted  and locked inside a bizarre bird cage in the villain's lair. I loved everything about this hypnotic  nihilistic  and emotionally touching movie. It is the superior of the three first Scorpion films and features one great scene after another. I can't recommend it highly enough.,positive
The third film in a cycle of incomparably brilliant Exploitation movies  and the third masterpiece in a row  Joshuu Sasori: Kemono-beya aka. Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable (aka. Sasori: Den Of The Beast where I live) of 1973 is a film that differs from its predecessors in some aspects  but that equals (or arguably even surpasses) them in brilliance. The entire original Sasori series with the wonderful Meiko Kaji stands out as the absolute highlight in WIP cinema  and all of the films  especially the first three  uniquely combine Exploitation and Art-house cinema like no other movie does. Beast Stable is the third  and second-to-last Sasori film with Meiko Kaji  the last one to be directed by genius director Shunya Ito and  in my opinion  the greatest of them all. The first film Joshuu 701-gô: Sasori of 1972 is an absolute masterpiece of Exploitation cinema and simply THE Definition of Exploitation-Art. In the equally brilliant first sequel  Joshuu Sasori: Dai-41 zakkyo-bô Ito added more surrealism and symbolism. The third Sasori film  Beast Stable keeps up the surrealism (allthough not quite to the same extent as the second)  and features even more social criticism than its predecessors. Topics like poverty  forced prostitution and the exploitation of the poor are central themes of the movie. <br /><br />This third Sasori film is ingenious and sublime in all aspects and arguably the greatest of the  generally brilliant  cycle (to me it's this one  with the first one as a close second). Once again  Best Stable is both very artistic and very Exploitation-like. The visually stunning film features an enormous amount of brutal violence and sleaze again  as well as sequences of enormous surrealistic beauty. The stunningly beautiful Meiko Kaji is once again brilliant in her role of Nami Matsushima (aka. Sasori). I absolutely worship this wonderful actress  and I'm sure I'm not the only one to do so. The rest of the performances are also great  especially Mikio Narita is great as a police Inspector who is obsessed with catching Sasori. The musical score is the same throughout all three films  with Urami-Bushi  sung by Meiko Kaji herself  as the main theme  which is great  since the score is  simply put  pure perfection. As its predecessors  Beast Stable is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece of Exploitation-Art that no serious lover of film can afford to miss. The entire Sasori-cycle ranges high on my personal all-time favorite list. Beast Stable is arguably the most brilliant masterpiece of them all! 10/10,positive
I have been looking forward to the release of this DVD (and it's follow-up {Female Prisoner Scorpion: #701's Grudge Song}) for some time. I very much enjoyed the first two movies of this series. After just watching this film  I would have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three. <br /><br />All three of these movies were directed by Shunya Ito. What is great about them  though  is that  even though they all feature the same lead character (wonderfully played by Meiko Kaji)  they are each vastly different from the others. <br /><br />The first movie (Female Prisoner #701: Scorpion) is more or less a typical Women In Prison movie. But the character of Scorpion is very intriguing - very reminiscent of the anti-heroes of many spaghetti westerns. And the director often used some very interesting and unusual visual approaches to the material. <br /><br />The second movie (Female Convict Scorpion: Jailhouse 41) is a real tour-de-force. Not so much a WIP movie as the bulk of the film has Scorpion and six other escaped inmates on the lam. <br /><br />This movie (Female Prisoner Scorpion: Beast Stable) is the third in the series and the last one directed by Shunya Ito. This one plays out as much more of a crime drama. Once again  our heroine is on the run. But this time out  she has managed to maintain a certain amount of normalcy in her life (relatively speaking anyway). She gets a job  she finds a place to live  she makes a friend on the outside. But  of course  everything has to unravel eventually. FPS: Beast Stable has a more straight-forward story that is told at a more leisurely pace than its predecessors. But I found it to be engaging from beginning to end. And don't worry: there is still plenty of depravity to go around in this movie! But I think these movies transcend most exploitation films because the more disturbing elements are played in a straighter tone rather than being used exclusively for in-your-face shock value. Yes  there were definitely moments in this movie where I cringed mightily. But I didn't feel that they detracted from the value of the story (well  maybe a time or two). One thing I have greatly enjoyed about these films is the continued build-up of Scorpion's mythos. With this entry character development is used much more extensively than in the previous two. We get to see that she is much more than just a stone-hearted vengeful badass!<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier in this review  a fourth movie followed. It also features Meiko Kaji as Scorpion but had a different director. Without giving anything away I want to mention that FPS: Beast Stable ends in such a way as to make a sequel completely unnecessary. The fourth film is still quite good but it seems to play as a superfluous footnote to a mind-blowing trilogy.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in out-of-the-ordinary films. FPS: Beast Stable can be enjoyed as a stand-alone piece (as can the first two movies) but I would also recommend watching the others first if you have not already done so.,positive
I loved this show. I think the first time I tried rocky road ice cream was due to this show. Wasn't the shop located like right on the beach or something? I actually wrote back and forth with Marci for several years. I lost touch and wish I could reconnect now as adults. Anyone know where she is now? I wish they would put it out on DVD. I seriously doubt that since I think there maybe like five or six people who even remember the show airing in the first place. They just don't make shows like this anymore  do they? I wonder if it would still hold up in this day and age. Do you guys know anyone that could burn DVD's of the show they taped on VHS? I'd be willing to pay(within reason).,positive
I'm sorry to see that it has been rated that low by many people. The series started off very good and after the first season it wasn't that good.<br /><br />People tend to forget the beginning of something and only look at the end. This is not good to do  you should look at the total  not the end result. It is sad that a lot of the usual characters died but  damn  we had a lot of nice NEW characters.<br /><br />Please do not attach yourself to a few characters but attach yourself to the series  the plot. Please do understand that I didn't like it when Boone died  when Augur died but well... it needs to be done. Can you imagine that everyone keeps living the whole series when they are in a lot of danger all the time? Come on  face it  if they didn't die they would be invincible. In this way you will always keep the tension  will he survive  will he die? I do realize that people attach their selves to characters  I do that too. My favorite character was Augur  the one who could get into every computer he wanted. He was the one who was mysterious  he could do things with the computer no one else could do.<br /><br />I wish to make one statement to all the people who vote negative  does a series which started so good deserve to have such low rating? Should we look at the final season instead of the total? Should we not see how good the series was when it started? Should we not see how much we enjoyed it?,positive
Believe me I wanted this series to work  but the early departure of Kevin Kilner dealt a near death blow after season one. Robert Leeshock just wasn't right for the part and Jane Heitmeyer did an admirable job as lead but the series just got too messy and confused at that point. I don't know what happened in Season Five  what a mess. Sometimes its time to drop the red cape and just stick the sword in the bull  if you know what I mean. The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict. If not for their talents and well-written dialogue they would have been two weird bald man-chicks in a B-movie series.<br /><br />If only this series could have ended at season 4 and picked up later by SyFy...,positive
Ok  everybody agreed on what was the best season. The first. And killing off Boone was a bad desicion. Also killing off others was bad. Blame the directors and writers for it. Bad boys. BUT. I still think this is the best scifi series ever! Sorry guys I can't help it! I see that the quality of the series was decreasing after the first season. Still it's easy to accept Liam as the new main character  if you are over Boone. He is really... mysterious. The thing that shocked me most was when Lilli was written out of the story and how. That was something she didn't deserve! And what do we get? Some blonde chick called Renee  with absolutely no character! But these Taelons stay mysterious  and you stay wondering about theyre true plans till the end. True Suspence. The conversations between Zo'or and Da'an are sometimes brilliant.<br /><br />I understand that  when you jump in on an episode from the 3th 4th or 5th season  you may not understand this show. But when you watch from the beginning  you just cant break loose!<br /><br />The acting is great  the special FX are marvellous  the music is beautiful and the plot intriguing. Gotta see this  guys!,positive
Gene Roddenberry never let his fans down. His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that will never be matched. Earth: The Final Conflict was proof! His pilot film and the first 2 Seasons were well written and meticulously produced  but somewhere along the way the Roddenberry touch was lost. The loss of lead  Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely hurt the series as he was a vital part of what made it work. The story involves the human race being visited by the Taelons  an extra-terrestrial race who dub themselves 'The Companions'. After 3 years they have given earth new technologies  helpful information about the Universe and more. Many question their intentions here on Earth. The main liaison on Earth between the races is Da'an (Leni Parker) and he is to many  the most trustworthy Taelon. Questions arise: just why are they here? what are their goals  is Da'an aware of any suspected plots against the humans? There is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen) who utilizes his millions to investigate the Taelons. By the end of the First Season things are going well  Da'an seems trustworthy  Boone assists Doors in his investigation while working with Da'an and the Taelons as a liaison. In the middle of the 2nd Season things start unraveling and the once terrific and fascinating series spirals downward  mostly because Roddenberry had died and was not around to guide the producers  of whom his wife Majel Barrett-Roddenberry was co-producer. Still  the first Season remains intriguing and fun to watch.,positive
Earth Final Conflict began like a new world  a new vision from the creator of Star trek  something fresh and unique full of great elements. A very good cast with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone  an ex cop good begins to work as guard of some kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons)  after the dead of his wife in strange circumstances. But soon the character of Kilner joins to a group with the mission to discover what are the truth intentions of the aliens  why they seem to be so nice and care for the human race. Soon this resistance group begin to discover the sinister plans of the Talons using the humans in they own problems to survive they own destruction. As I said before  the show began great  all was almost perfect  including characters like Da'an  the original Da'an was a big mystery because he seems to be a nice creature but at the same time he has his own evil plans manipulating some people in earth. Soon came Zo'or who wasn't bad but... mark the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first big enemy of humans  the incarnation of evil  killing what could be something greater in Da'an. The first seasons ends in a great way with the dead of Boone and the second shows a new lead character (Liam) an hybrid being of human and Kimera (another alien race) with some very interesting powers. He replace Kilner character in a good way so another storylines make it better  including the conflict with the jaridians and the atavus. But as I said lines before the evilness of Zo'or begin to take more importance so the new conflicts were less realistic as the same Talons. With time the whole great storyline of the alien roots of Liam where almost totally erased the same with other things of the previous seasons. So when the final season began the original Earth Final conflict was just an almost forgotten dreams  all the magic was missing  just to let some vain intents to keep alive the show including the return of Kilner and Liam for a few episodes. The final episode was just the evidence of how bad was the show with so many bad changes (to think the writers of some episodes didn't know anything about the first stories)  it was one of the worst end I have ever seen in a TV show. A real shame because Earth Final Conflict began like something unique  fresh  the stories the cast  after watch so many show from USA  something from Canada from the mind of the creator of Star trek was wonderful but in the end all change to worse. I hope someday someone make a remake of this show  of course using nothing from season fourth and fifth (except the cast  everyone were perfect in his work). I still can dream in a better things.,positive
I remember this film fondly from seeing it in the theatre. I recently found a copy on VHS & it held up to my memory of it. While obviously not a big budget film  the acting is quite credible & the scenery  locales  & costumes are very well done. I only wish the Mammoths had been in more of the picture  but when you see them  they are also well done (remember  SFX was done in those days without benefit of computers  some poor devil had to actually put all that hair & fake tusks on real elephants!)...the same effect was used on the elephants in Quest for Fire. A better than average adventure film & a chance for the star  Rod Cameron to play something besides a cowboy  which he also did very well over the years.,positive
This was a excellent movie. I deal with a child who I am raising that has FAE and watching this movie was more than word can explain. I also purchased the book and it was great. I would like to have a copy for my own use and so I can have my son's teachers watch it also.I would like to know if anyone could sell me a copy of this movie  let me use it for a time or refer me to someone where I could purchase it. Thank You  Myra I would recommend this movie to anyone who deal with children/adults with special ability's. This movie should be shown again on TV. The team of doctor's that have been tracking my son would also like to have a copy. His special Ed teacher has also asked me to try to locate a copy that he can have or that he can borrow.<br /><br />Thank You,positive
Interesting tale of giant mammoth elephants running amok in modern India. Features transparent special effects-elephants dressed in shaggy coats sporting tusk extensions. All this said  we do have a good story and a fine cast at work  and an exciting climax. It's been said that the running time on this one was doubled when it showed in India-courtesy of Robert Lippert  a master at 'padding.' Given a choice  opt for the shorter version.,positive
I can't really criticize this film. It is literally the first film I ever remember seeing and lead to a lifelong love of science fiction and horror films and prehistoric animals. Fortunately  seeing it again years later  it held up fairly well. Rod Cameron plays a big game hunter whose last safari was wiped out by mammoths. No one believes him  including his best friend  played by Cesar Romero  whose brother was among those killed. And Rod Cameron was the only survivor. The film was shot in India and has some good scenery. The acting is on a high level. I don't believe Rod Cameron  Cesar Romero and Marie Winsor ever turned in a bad performance. The mammoths  when they finally arrive are fairly effective. The ending also has an unusual twist  particularly for a 1950's science fiction film. Definitely worth seeing.,positive
The Jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie. The only sci-fi part is the Woolly Mammoths living in the present day.<br /><br />Elephants are attacking villages in a part of India and these attacks are also killing people. An expedition is sent to investigate and one of the members of this  an American hunter blames these elephants are being frightened by Woolly Mammoths  which are suppose to be extinct. Nobody believes him at first  but they do when the Mammoths appear at the end. An earthquake finishes them off.<br /><br />The Jungle was shot on location in India and has a lot of nice scenery and some good Indian music  including some songs which keep the movie moving along nicely. The Mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long tusks stuck on.<br /><br />The cast includes Rod Cameron  Cesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (Cat-Women of the Moon).<br /><br />The Jungle is worth seeing  just for the scenery and music. Very enjoyable.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.,positive
This was a surprisingly very good movie  and an interesting idea.. However  it was just a little bit disappointing in that the 'Twist' was a little too predictable and just a bit too early on in the movie. Whilst watching  it started to get a little bizarre and confusing to the point that  the only reasonable outcome possible was the inevitable plot twist  but it certainly did not ruin this movies flow. There were superb performances  there was never a dull boring moment  so totally well worth watching this one. It kept me interested right up until the end  and for me there isn't many movies that can do that these days. I highly recommend people watch this terrific little movie.,positive
This movie is a mystery. It's not scary  it's spooky. You'll probably jump at some points and for some of it you'll be scratching your head to figure it out. It unfolds its mystery through the main character Eve and her psychotic college project at an insane asylum  Don. He needs her to search for some clues to vindicate himself from murdering his mother  and once Eve agrees to help him  she completely opens up pandora's box and unleashes some very strange things  including Malachi. I won't go into Malachi  but I thought the way that played out was complete genius. I know movie buffs won't regard this movie with the same prestige as other classics because it doesn't have anyone very famous in it (Angelina Jolie's brother was excellent  but maybe he should have asked his sister to show her face just so this movie could get some recognition) but I do think the way the Malachi ending works is something to talk about. I've recommended this to my friends  definitely worth the purchase or rental price.,positive
Stephanie Meyer is going to be so ticked! Now  her book Breaking Dawn will not be first with that title. Sorry  Twilight fans.<br /><br />Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is medical student  Eve  who is assigned to interview psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the twist  and when she found out they both grew up in the same town  I was sure of it.<br /><br />She kept getting deeper and deeper with her patient to the point that I felt there was a shared delusion going on. At times  she even acted like she had PTSD. I really thought she was losing it.<br /><br />Well  she wasn't losing it  and when the end came  I was floored. My whole suspicion turned out to be wrong. The twist was even more amazing than I believed.<br /><br />Overton was fantastic and the story is so much better than something Stephanie Meyer would come up with. A must see.,positive
I caught this movie on local t.v. at about 4:30 a.m. I didn't have expectations for it but after the opening credits I knew I was into something good.<br /><br />There are situations that are left for your interpretation to find out what really happened so your attention is a key factor.<br /><br />The whole psychological thriller situation deals a lot with character development and the way things are executed by the main character.<br /><br />Your sub-conscience also plays an important part because through a series of events and dialogs you will be able to make a correct interpretation and generate an opinion.<br /><br />The technical aspects are very good. Really good in fact. Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and she's candy for the eye although she's most of the time in her white clothes.<br /><br />The fear factor is almost inexistent but there's plenty of mystery and tension to dig from.<br /><br />I would recommend it for those who enjoy supernatural and psychological thrillers.,positive
When i saw this movie the first thing that jumped at me was the acting of Kelly Overton a young (and op and coming star) actress that i saw for the first time totally blew me away.. she is amazing on screen and I'm really looking forward to see what the future brings her....<br /><br />The movie it self was good in the sense that it let Kelly Overton do her stuff and take the wiever for a ride... not much new tho i had the feeling that i had seen it all before.. but a good experience :) I would recommend this movie... if only to see Kelly Overton.. this stage actor takes the screen by storm.. i give this movie a vote of 7... 5 for the acting performance and 2 for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />And on a last note.. sorry about my bad English.. if this is gibberish for you :P plz ignore me...,positive
I saw the film yesterday and really enjoyed it.Although there were several clues which I could realize after second time watching  I was not able to awake the Dow-Dawn case. Maybe this was my carelessness.The subconsciousness of a woman was became concrete with personalization.'Let me go out'the key sentence of the film.Let me go out from deep deep inside of your brain and we will both be free.A discrete film that forcing the limits of human conscious and brain.Anybody who have seen the 'Machinist' would realize the similarities with breaking dawn.A man that could not escape from his conscience (again a psychological and an abstract concept)meets it in an human body.And he will just be free of accepting and realizing there is no way of escape.Also I want to mention about the performances of 'breking dawn's stuffs.In spite of having not many experiences  from actors and actresses to director all exhibited separately reasonable performance that have created a synergy which would increase the quality of the movie,positive
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and to date  this year  it is one of my favorites. The story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and I knew what would happen far too early. Usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me (like The Others) but even knowing the outcome I still enjoyed it right up to the end. Looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from Kelly Overton (Eve)  I'm afraid I was not. Her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me  in contrast to the amazing performance (or characterization) by James Haven (Don Wake) ... I hope we see more of him. What a great little film  highly recommended to all!,positive
This movie was everything but boring. It deals with reality. To the people who think this movie was boring  open your eyes to the real problems in our society. Our children are dying. The consequences of alcohol and drug abuse are not to be ignored. I work in a correctional facility as a chemical dependency counselor and i deal with these problems every day. People of all ages and all walks of life are effected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys families  hurts people and leads to serious brain damage all kinds of health problems  and death. It is all preventable. This movie should be shown in every high-school in the world. If anyone owns this movie and wants to sell it  or sell me a copy  please e-mail me at: Ottenbreit2@netzero.net thank you,positive
Saw the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in Oct '04 . Mark Robertson took a huge chance writing an extremely difficult part for his first film and it paid off big in his casting of Kelly Overton. I had a strong feeling she came from the theater so I looked her up here and ...surprise  I'm right. More Hollywood actors should follow her lead  give up the expensive acting classes and get back to theater because only with that kind of training will you be prepared for a ride like this. For all the great things I can say about the film and the director (and there are many) I just can't stop talking to people about Kelly Overton's masterful performance. We'll be seeing a LOT MORE of her work  no doubt. <br /><br />Congratulations to Mark and Kelly on a daring film. Get it out in the theaters so I can bring all the people I made want to see the film ASAP!,positive
Wow  Stella Shorts are great! Lots of patrons from The State and Stella  the TV show. I never knew that Stella could have gotten any better then they were on the TV show Stella or even Comedy Central Presents: Stella. I also never knew short comedies could be any good. My favorite ones were Pizza  Racking Leaves  The Woods and David arranges to a meeting with his long lost cousin Greg. I think over all that David was the funniest one. Its funny when he doesn't make sense. I like the music in the shorts. Thats something I pay attention to a lot. They always had good taste in music. I wish they still made shorts  either that or bring back there sitcom. I hope they continue making good and funny comedy.,positive
"When I first saw Stella on comedy central I thought god, this is horrible! But I loved Wet Hot American Summer. So I knew something didn't make sense. There was nothing left for me to do but search out for the Stella shorts which I had heard contained more dildos than any other comedy troupe out there. When I found them not only were my dildo expectations met  but I found probably the greatest comedy scenes I've seen in years. The set of twenty odd short films put me on the edge of my seat with water running down my legs. Not only did I laugh my ass off the first time I watched them but continued to laugh harder when I watched them over and over again. It's really a shame Comedy Central had the restrictions of cable television for the Stella series. It would have faired much better on HBO or Showtime. Their brand of humor can't be restricted by censors or popular culture. Given even if it was on HBO I'm sure the masses would have voted it canceled in a season or less  but still it would have been fantastic. Needless to say I'm now in love with Stella and all it's individual members. Any Stella fan should check out David Wain's site with all his short films. They are equally as enjoyable as Stella itself. So my hat goes off to Michael Showalter  Michael Ian Black  and David Wain for the unbelievable comedy they have made with Stella. I hope to see much more of the troupe in the future.",positive
Hilarious and low-budget comedy at it's best. This set of unique individual sketches with extensive self-referential humor is reminiscent of a really raunchy Kids in the Hall. Be prepared for some of the most random and recitation worthy lines  filled with ethnic slurs and awful language. Sex toys included!<br /><br />There should be more comedy like this around today. This collection of sketches on one DVD will warrant many viewings and reviewings in order to appreciate some of the parts. If you enjoyed The State and/or Wet Hot American Summer  get ready for some more glory. If you are even considering this for younger audiences I would say that every child on earth should see this.,positive
I honestly don't know what words IMDB will allow me to use in this review  as a result  I'm having a hard time describing these shorts. Let's just say there's a good amount of gay sex  some necrophilia  some incest  a fair amount of masturbation  and several artificial.... members. And I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />Not that it's ALL crude humor. It isn't. They stray away from fart gags for the most part  with the exception of one sketch entitled Pizza in which they use one very well. They being 3/11ths of the short-lived sketch comedy group that aired on MTV called The State  namely David Wain  Michael Showalter  and Michael Ian Black.<br /><br />The trio go on adventures  usually playing themselves and encounter strange and unusual people  people that are often actually more normal than they are. The supporting cast is fantastic as well. Paul Rudd  Julie Bowen  Bradley Cooper  Zach Galifianakis  and Sam Rockwell all make appearances in various sketches. They're also joined by other The State alums like Joe Lo Truglio and Todd Holoubek. The musical selections are also very well placed.<br /><br />I've enjoyed these sketches over and over again  but they aren't for everybody as they're pretty vulgar most of the time. If you like clever humor that isn't afraid to push the limits of good taste  then I highly recommend this. If you liked Wet Hot American Summer (Directed and written by Wain and Showalter) or The State  then you should really enjoy this.<br /><br />I think it can currently only be ordered online. Check out their website and stream a couple of sketches to get an idea if you really want this first  and then find out how to buy the DVD.,positive
MISSISSIPPI MERMAID is a disturbing and unsettling examination of what it means to be in love with the wrong person.<br /><br />Truffaut's directing is his usual outstanding work. Although this is far from his best. Deneuve is very  very beautiful. Despite the character she portrays.,positive
This must be one of the most horribly titled films of all time. The kind of title that ruins a film because it neither evokes the plot nor the characters. A title like this makes a film flop  even the French title is not much better. Too bad - Truffaut & Deneuve must have been enough to sell it..<br /><br />This is a long film  but largely worth it. Clearly influenced by Hitchcock  we have an intercontinental story about a personal ad bride  her rich husband  a theft  an identity switch  and obsessive love. The plot here is actually very good  and takes us on an unexpected trip.<br /><br />The thing that works both for and against the movie is the focus on the relationship. It is an interesting study in how these plot developments are played out in real life relationship with these two people. Unfortunately  this is what bogs the film down  and makes it ultimately dissatisfying. We do like films to have a real sense of finality  and that is missing here.<br /><br />It was the case in many of her films that Deneuve became a canvas for Directors to play their fantasies out on  and this time it doesn't work as well. Messy here  is the fact that the Director clearly just wanted to have Deneuve take her top off a few times. Deneuve is an actress who always seems very deliberate and thoughtful  so these attempts to make her seem spontaneous fall flat. <br /><br />Basically  the script needed to be worked out better before shooting began  to make this film tighter and shorter and to snap. But Truffaut didn't snap  did he? So - it wanders a bit  but remains interesting.,positive
A very interesting plot of the film based on the novel Waltz into Darkness of the writer Cornell Woolrich. It is a drama rather than a film noir  which tries to send a message that love changes your own life  i.e. your love to any person and the love you received from him/her. A wealthy man really changed his life for love  while his partner finally understood that he was the only one that loved her. Belmondo played well as usual  while a somewhat still young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police agent. Frankly Bouquet was not so impressive in this film  but less than that was the performance of Catherine Deneuve. She was not so convincingly in her role as a prostitute then lover/wife of Louis Mahé (Belmondo). For those who like to visit the world  the film offers the occasion to see part of the Ascension Island  and also Lyon city in France.,positive
This agreeable French movie deals about a millionaire owner of a tobacco factory on an African island nearly to Madagascar named Louis(Jean Paul Belmondo). He's a single man looking wife  then he advertises a bride and gets a gorgeous woman named Julia(Catherine Deneuve). When she spontaneously appears turns out to be much more attractive than expected. He marries to Julia but she suddenly disappears.A French eye private(Michael Bouquet) is hired by Julia's sister and soon he's on the trail of his previous spouse. Later Louis encounters her in a dancing-hall under another name. In spite of the romantic delusion and everything  Louis goes on enamored with his enigmatic wife.<br /><br />This film is a splendid drama plenty of betrayal deception  killing  theft and Hitchcockian suspense. Good performances by Jean Paul Belmondo as young proprietary of a cigarette company who seems determined to fall under the spell of a femme fatale and a wonderful Catherine Deneuve as suspect heroine. The film gets several references to the American cinema  but Truffaut(400 blows) was a fervent moviegoer  such as : Johnny Guitar  Colorado Jim  Bogart  and Hitchcock.The USA version was cut numerous minutes and deserves an urgent restoring and remastering. Loosely based on the novel titled'Waltz into darkness' by Cornell Woolrich (Rear window and screenwriter of Alfred Hitchcock hour) who also was adapted in 'Truffaut's The bride wore black'.Colorful cinematography by Denys Clerval(Stolen kisses) and atmospheric musical score by Antoine Duhamel  Truffaut's usual musician.This is one of the best of his suspense movies along with ¨Farenheit 451 and Shoot the piano player¨. Remade by an inferior version by Michael Christofer(2001) with Antonio Banderas  Angelina Jolie and Jack Thompson  full of erotic and lust scenes.,positive
It has been years since I have been privileged to see this movie on TV. I only wish I could contact someone to see it again. I married a man with three children and two had Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. I didn't' realize this but seeing this movie helped me understand more about their problems and more about how I can love them and help them overcome their difficulties. My step-son is now 35 and thank the Lord he has blossomed wonderfully but still has many after affects of being born by an alcoholic mother. We speak every month to Rehab patients with alcohol and drug addictions and this sharing has truly made monumental changes in their behaviors and endeavors to start out a new life not addicted to drugs and alcohol. Please please let me know how I can get a copy VHS or DVD of this movie or when they will show the movie again on TV. If you have not been in these shoes  you probably could never understand its value. Thank you so very much.,positive
The film is a joy to watch  not just for the plot  which is gripping  but also for the superb performances of the actors  Deneuve and Belmondo. Though considered a 'flop' on its first release it has become a critical success  and it is clear to see why. Deneuve's acting style suited the film brilliantly. she constantly gives the impression that she is holding back or hiding something  and her character in this film is. I will not spoil it with saying what  though it is divulged fairly early on. Belmondo is lovable as the fairly naiive but in love tobacconist. I would recommend this film to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. It is a brilliant Hitchcockian style thriller with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that develop as the film does. The film is approx 2 hrs  so you feel that you have not been sold short. Deneuve steals the show in this film  and it is clear that at the time of making the film Truffaut was very much smitten with her. A definite must see for any cineaste or moviefan. 10/10,positive
(Contains spoilers)<br /><br />People who put a Lonely Heart's ad in the newspaper are often idealists. They try to put into a few words everything they are and expect. The exchange of letters is full of hope...Louis Mahe (Jean Paul Belmondo)  owner of a cigarette company on the ile de la Reunion (east of Madagascar) is so affected by the letters of Julie Roussell that he proposes to her. But not the expected pretty brunette comes from board of the Mississippi  but - Catherine Deneuve. And we know from the start that she is a marriage imposter and that a crime has taken place. She shows no interest in Julie's wardrobe (she does not even get her trunk open) and neglects her canary until it dies. But the most basic tricks of seduction (an open zipper) are sufficient to transform Louis into a pliable little dog. First: a joint bank account. And then  when Julie's sister draws attention to herself  the flight. With 27 850 millions of Louis' 28 millions - she would have needed his signature for the entire sum.<br /><br />Louis and Julie's sister engage a private detective (Michel Bouquet). Louis contrives to trace Marion (Deneuve's real name) in Antibes where she works as taxi-girl - her gangster-lover left her penniless  or rather centimeless. Louis finds himself unable to kill her. She tells her story: Orphan. Precocious. Lesbian experiences. Many sugardaddies. Jail - and soon she leads him by the nose again. The detective turns out to be sly as a fox and tenacious as a blood hound; Louis and Marion bury his body in the cellar. They flee to Paris  where Louis discovers that Marion has a costly taste. She worships money like a deity. He sells his firm at a fraction of its value. But when the corpse of the detective is discovered (a flood) they have to flee again - without the money. Life in a mountain lodge  together with a whining loser - Marion can think of a more cheerful life without this appendage...<br /><br />A high point in the careers of everybody involved. Belmondo's self-deceit makes him nearly endearing. Deneuve looks beautiful in her wardrobe by Yves St. Laurent  and her performance is delightful: At first she fakes the fragile wifey - too timid to ask her husband for money  that's why the joint bank account is needed - but after being exposed she sounds like Katharine Hepburn in the jail scene of BRINGING UP BABY. The scenery is spectacular - the tropics  the riviera  Paris. Truffaut directs with self-evident aplomb: the sixties were the only decade when european films were head and shoulders above american productions. After this film Truffaut was able to look his idol  Alfred Hichcock  full in the face.,positive
In Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean  the owner of a cigarette factory Louis Mahé (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is engaged through correspondence with Julie Roussel and he does not know her. When Julie arrives in the island to get married with Louis  he waits for her in the docks but Louis does not recognize Julie in the passenger vessel and finds that she is totally different from the picture she had sent to Louis. They get married and Louis shares his bank accounts with her. When Julie's sister writes a letter to Louis asking her sister to write to her  Louis discovers that the woman is not Julie that is missing. Further  he finds that the woman has cleared his bank accounts and left the island. Louis and Julie's sister hire an efficient private detective Comolli (Michel Bouquet) and Louis travels to France seeking the woman  but he has a nervous breakdown in Nice and is submitted to an intense sleeping therapy in a clinic. He recovers and finds that the woman  actually Marion Vergano (Catherine Deneuve)  works in the Phoenix Club Privé in Antibes and lives in the low-budget Monorail Hotel. Louis breaks in her room and when she arrives from the club  she tells that she was happy with him but her former dangerous lover Richard had blackmailed her. Louis is still in love with Marion and escapes with her to the countryside. But Comolli is chasing Marion in France accused of murdering Julie.<br /><br />La Sirène du Mississipi is a film-noir by the great director/writer François Truffaut  with an unconventional love story of passion  murder and love that hurts. The femme fatale Catherine Deneuve is astonishing  probably in the top of her beauty and is delightful to see her face and the topless scenes on the road and in the room. Jean-Paul Belmondo is very athletic  and the sequence when he escalates the wall of the hotel is impressive. Catherine Deneuve makes this film worth and gives credibility to the passion and lust of Louis. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): A Sereia do Mississipi (The Mississippi Mermaid),positive
I've slowly been collecting the films available on DVD of both Catherine Deneuve and Francois Truffaut. Both actress and director have done some stinkers in their time - fortunately Mississipi Mermaid is not one of them.<br /><br />Next to The Soft Skin  coincidentally staring Deneuve's sister (the late Francoise Dorleac)  this would have to be my favourite Truffaut film.<br /><br />As well as directing  Truffaut also wrote the screenplay. Something that always strikes me about Truffaut is his almost childlike innocence when presenting a story -- one could almost call it naivety.<br /><br />There's a scene towards the end of the film where Belmondo returns to the apartment in Lyon with the remains of the loot. He rings the doorbell and Deneuve answers wearing a negligee. In the time it takes Belmondo to reach their room from the street  Deneuve changes into her dress  puts on her best pair of stockings and shoes  then lies on the bed and pretends she is asleep. It's a scene that could almost come from the mind of a child - but that's Truffaut for you.<br /><br />Watching Catherine Deneuve in her films of the late 60's is indeed a sensory pleasure. She is so extraordinarily beautiful it is almost painful for us to watch. Incidentally  for those fans  there are a couple of topless scenes of her in this film - indeed a sinful pleasure.<br /><br />I disagree with previous posters. I see nothing 'Hitchcockian' about the film at all. As for the 'look' of it - i love the look of the older film stock used in the 60's. It certainly gives films of this period a unique look.<br /><br />Highly recommended for both Deneuve and Truffaut fans......,positive
This is one of the best films I've seen in the last years.Belmonndo and Deneuve shine in their respective roles  he as a naive plantation owner and she as an enigmatic trickster.Words won't do this masterpiece justice suffice it to say that this is a movie that explores the darker side of love and the pain humiliation and capacity for self-delusion that go with it  although it's dressed as a film noir. Forget that feeble remake with Jolie and Banderas  see the genuine artticle instead and treat yourselves to some moments of great cinematic beauty.,positive
I love this movie. It is the first film Master P have ever done. It is based on the story of his life. It is low-budget  but it is very good. It shows how Master p grew up in projects in New Orleans.<br /><br />Not only did Master P start in this movie  he also was the writer and director with Moon Jones. The DVD also has The No Limit ice cream party on it. This movie shows how Master P goes from bad too good and how he had to deal with the things around him. It also has many of The No Limit Records roster in this film. You should buy or rent this film.<br /><br />It is a great movie to watch is you like rap  or is a Master P fan. I will not spoil this movie for you. Go get this movie as fast as you can and watch it. You will like it.,positive
This movie was marketed extremely well. When it was released in '97  during the middle of Master P's fame and success anything and everything with his name on it was selling off the shelves. That's why it's no wonder this underground urban drama sold over 250 000 copies and still goin'.<br /><br />If you are a fan of No Limit back then or even now check it out. It has a few old school phatty videos and don't get me started with the freaky deaky strippers at the bonus Ice Cream Party. So what I got to say to all the people who don't like Master P or No Limit Records don't watch it because it isn't for you and don't bother voting on it because you're only going to deter TRU no limit fans from renting or purchasing this video with your low votes.,positive
Jewel Thief is one of those suspense thrillers in which the viewers are left guessing till the end who the villain is. Suspense builds from the very first scene when the jewel thief becomes a national problem and there are cleverly concealed clues in the film so that you can guess who is the jewel thief. The story portrays that Dev Anand (Vinay in the film) and the jewel thief have identical faces. But you get a 1000 watt shock when you finally come to know the villain. There are many surprises and a lot of fishy stuff going on but there is time for romance and six melodious ever lasting songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar  Asha Bhosle  Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafi.<br /><br />This film was also talked about for its song's videos. Consider the teasing and counter teasing in Asman Ke Neeche. Or the blocking of road by Dev Anand when Tanuja was going out with her friends in Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara. Or the romantic Dil Pukare Are Are in the beautiful Sikkim. Or the wonderful dance by Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add to it Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you will never forget this film for any reason.<br /><br />Able acting by Dev Anand  Ashok Kumar  Tanuja and Vyjantimala and direction by Vijay Anand (Dev Anand's younger brother) makes this one of the best loved Hindi films of all times even today.,positive
An excellent thriller of all time. Vijay Anand excels as Director and Editor. Performances by Dev Anand  Vyjayantimala  Tanuja and Ashok Kumar prove to be an asset to the film which has its screenplay worked out to the minutest detail. Cinematography adds to the mystery  glamour and other requirements of the story as it evolves. And to top it all  music by Sachin Dev Burman is unforgettable. Yeh dil na hota bechara by Kishore Kumar  Raat akeli hai by Asha Bhosle  Rula ke gaya sapna mera by Lata  Aasman ke niche by Lata and Rafi and Hothon pe aisi baat main by Lata  again reaffirm Burman Dada's unique stature as a top notch composer with a style of his own.,positive
Jewel Thief is *THE* crime thriller of Bollywood  and why should it not be? It is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in Indian Cinema Vijay Anand ('Johny Mera Naam' and 'Teesri Manzil.) I could watch this movie for any of the following reasons (in order of importance):<br /><br />1 Vijay Anand's direction 2 R D Burman's music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vyjayanthimala 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Majrooh Sultanpuri's lyrics<br /><br />Even if Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie it definitely has bond babes. Helen  Tanuja  and the mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some cameos.) But our sauvé Vinay (Dev Anand) is anything but Bond. He is out of control for most of the story and goes where the story takes him almost always as confused as we are. He even flirts with Anju (Tanuja) trying to hit her romantic nerve  just so that he can get employed in her father's shop.<br /><br />Dev Anand might be in a double role - well I don't want to spoil your movie or else I would have told you. That is what most of the mystery is about. Dev Anand works in a Jewelry shop and there is a robbery when he is supposed to be at work - though is not  or at least has a perfect alibi. We wonder who did it  is it Dev Anand as 'Vijay' the person he claims to be or is it 'Amar' someone we have not yet seen but many people claim is his look alike. Comes 'Shalu' (Vyjayanthimala) who even claims that he is her fiancé  in a tense situation Dev Anand has to prove that he is Vinay and not Amar. While everyone wonders if Dev Anand is Vinay or Amar he is asked to remove his socks. Amar we are told has 6 digits on one of his foot. While we watch with bated breath the events that are about to unfold Dev Anand even finds time to joke. <br /><br />The real life brothers Director Vijay Anand and Actor Dev Anand have many movies between them this is not the best of them but definitely the best in Crime Thriller. <br /><br />There are moments of Hitchcock's North By Northwest  but the movies are very different. Except for the confusion about who is who  a treacherous female lead and lot of traveling there isn't a lot of similarity. Dev Anand could very well be Amar in addition to being Vijay. People have seen him  they identify him where ever he goes. There are too many of those people for this to be a fraud. Finally Vinay thinks it is better to carry along with being Amar to find out what is the truth  and it is a sad mistake. He gets too deep into it  only to be saved by the twists of Cinema.<br /><br />When I watched the movie as a kid I was definitely not amused  the ending confused me completely. Even now there are parts about the ending that I do not like  but I'd recommend this movie anyway.<br /><br />Even as a kid I enjoyed the songs this movie has to offer. 'Yeh dil ...' - a definite loafers song in Kishor Kumar's voice. I could hear 'Rulake gaya ...' whole day long. Ditto for 'Aasmaan ke neeche' which is set 'under the skies' of Gangtok (at least the story line suggests that). 'Raat akeli hai' among the sexiest song to come out of Hindi cinema featuring Tanuja as the seductress. 'Meri taraf dekho' - Helen's cabaret and we 'look at her'. 'Hothon pe ...' - now  could there be any better thriller of a song than this. As the song progresses we are more tensed than we ever were and the words 'hidden in Shalu's lips' add to it.,positive
This story focuses on the birth defect known as FAS  or Fetal Alcohol Syndrome  a disease diagnosed too often among Native Americans. In spite of the down-beat nature of this drama  the great script and the characterizations move the story along very well. This is arguably Smits best performance.,positive
Unlike Bond and other detective movies  Alfred Hitchcock's hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage (and luck) would get out of it. Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is Vijay Anand's tribute to the master of suspense. The tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himself.<br /><br />It is the story of a common man Vinay who one day realizes that he has a double called Amar who in fact is a Jewel Thief. Suddenly Vinay finds himself in the middle of a hatching scheme and to save himself goes on a wild goose chase to find this Amar who remains one step ahead of him. The suspense is almost killing throughout the movie and as the plot unravels you are hit by the brilliance of the scheme. Just like Hitchcock's movies  Jewel Thief can boast of a grand climax shot inside the grand palace of Sikkim.<br /><br />Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand  Vijay Anand  Ashok Kumar  Vajyanti Mala  Tanuja  SD Burman  Kishore Kumar  Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. etc. are in their top forms. This is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.,positive
Jewel Thief is a rare breed of film - completely noir in its story but nothing noir about the presentation. A young man Vinay  superbly played by a newly face lifted Dev Anand at age 40+  is estranged from his police officer Dad and finds a job in a jeweler's store. Soon random people come up to him and call him Amar. Using just a few pithy moments the presence of a doppelganger is established. Then a woman Shalini (Vyjayantimala) comes forward and claims to be engaged to said doppelganger. She is accompanied by her loving brother (Ashok Kumar) who is so convinced that Vinay is actually Amar he makes him take his shoe off and prove that he is not Aamr  the 6 toed one. The jeweler's super cute daughter Anju (Tanuja) is completely enamored with Vinay. Amidst all this confusion there is a Jewel thief on the loose and he is stealing at will. Slowly we learn from Vinay's encounter with a super hot night club singer (Helen!) that the thief is Amar the doppelganger. Many many good looking women (Anju Mahendru  Faryal) are after the hero. The police force  including Vinay's Dad  are completely befuddled. Vinay is slowly falling for Shalini/Shalu and her brother seems to bless the union. The action moves to Sikkim as that is where Amar's next heist is to occur. The rest is for you to watch - the duplicate  the girls  the men who hang on to Vinay's every word thinking he is their boss Amar  the loving brother sister duo - nothing seems quite right  and it takes the deft story telling (and direction) by Vijay Anand to conclude this tale in a highly entertaining manner. The movie has numerous moments that you will wonder at until they deliciously weave into a grand finale at a dance in a palace in Sikkim.<br /><br />I was not a big Vyjayanthi fan but she is quite competent here  although at her chubbiest. She is able to add to the confusion in the story in a subtle way  but is best when she is sorrowful or dancing. Tanuja is cute as a button and I loved her in this film. I so badly wanted her to get the man. Dev was  well  Dev. If he were not walking like a man with a congenital shoulder defect (one shoulder always lower than the other) I would wonder who they had found to imitate him! Yet his style  charm and charisma were unfailing. In the song Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechara  only Dev could look cool carrying a fishing rod to which a large plastic fish was attached! Ashok Kumar was simply awesome - Dada Moni did not miss a beat the entire movie and turned this into one for the history books.<br /><br />SD Burman spun magic with numbers like Baithe Hain Kya Uske Paas (Helen in a blood red rooster imitation dancing on a bar top)  Aasman Ke Neeche  Rula Ke Gaya Sapna Mera  and my personal favorite seductive number Raat Akeli Hai Bujh Gaye Diye.<br /><br />If you are craving a great story  with more twists than a pretzel  wanting to be kept guessing  yet amused and entertained - then go buy or rent Jewel Thief. Better to buy it  then you can go back and see it again with your buddies. This one is a keeper.,positive
Nice movie. At the begining  i thought it's a medieve detective kind hi-fi movie  but the ending totally surprised me. I guess  the whole movie covers too many subjects  each of them can be the main subject e.g. avenge  friendship  and dream. But it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them. I think  it'd be a great movie if it's built around the ending from the very begining.<br /><br />,positive
Although I saw this movie in Korea  in Korean  and therefore did not understand the language  images sure say more than enough. From what I can make of it  this is the story: Two superb sword fighters become friends in their service as the king's guard. One of them finds himself opposed to the ways of the king and starts assassinating important men. The other has to hunt him down. This movie is visually great. The swordfighting is great. And the movie has a gripping end. I just hope this movie will be marketed for the western cinema goers. And be released on DVD  of course.,positive
I must say: out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out. It wasn't as epic as Musa-The Warriors and didn't develop the characters as well  but it had many nice ideas. Simple story: a elite soldier thought dead  returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval days. His counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him. The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. The motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end. You might need to watch it again to get all the connections right. And me personally...I loved the end. I could watch it over and over again. Maybe a little pathetic  but a real freedom fighter story.... People can be killed  but not the ideas they stand for....,positive
After seeing a preview for this film at my local mall where there is a stand for purchasing foreign films  I thought it looked very entertaining. Before watching the movie i went on to IMDb to see what ratings and comments it received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. Despite the hype  I watched to movie and to my surprise I found it unbelievable. <br /><br />The story was great (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the film is astonishing. I haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time. I really felt for both characters and sensed a strong bond. As reading previous posts about this movie not being epic enough or a lack of martial arts I could not disagree more. This film is what it is  its not Braveheart and its not Enter the Dragon but it is still a wonderful film that does an excellent job combining story both and action.<br /><br />While Sword In The Moon isn't perfect (what movie is?) it still is wonderful and moving. Just wait until the ending scene  with the music and cinematography together  its breathtaking. I only hope more people can see this movie to give it a fair voting.,positive
I saw the movie on its North American premiere (July 14  2004) at the Fantasia Festival. I was slightly disappointed as I had been expecting a more epic  ensemble cast movie along the lines of Musa the Warrior. Instead  the movie concentrated only a much smaller number of characters. Still  the movie was solid  thoughtful and visually intriguing. There were slightly jarring tone shifts from the dominant thoughtful and realistic tone of confused loyalties  intrigue and blood  versus the lighter  more flamboyant  martial arts sequences. It almost seemed as though the filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about whether the movie was supposed to be a martial arts flick or a historical epic. The story touches nicely on the issue about the need for loyalty versus the need to adapt to new situations. Is it really worth your life and those of your friends to be loyal to one's master or does there come a time when one must submit to the winds of change? Is there perhaps greater courage in leaving the old ways for new ones? How does one decide? These questions are raised in this movie  and ironically  there is the suggestion that the answer given  may in fact be the wrong one!,positive
Well  SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in Korea  and despite the mostly negative responses I've heard to it  and the suspiciously tardy DVD release  I couldn't help but pick it up - any wu xia film is better than most non-wu xia films in my eyes :D Perhaps low expectations were an advantage  because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyable.<br /><br />An assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne  and the government's top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit. This doesn't take particularly long  but the answer is not one he wanted to hear. Through prolonged flashbacks we learn why  and the history of the swordsman and the assassin  and of the revolution.<br /><br />The film is typically melodramatic for a Korean film  and resolutely serious in tone - no HK style comedy moments to be found here. The story can be a little difficult to follow at first  but all makes sense eventually. The film goes a bit wobbly at the end  but no worse than a Chang Cheh film might do  and for the most part I found it enjoyable. The production values are high  with some good cinematography to capture it. The fight scenes aren't up to the calibre of the better HK wu xia films  but perhaps they're not meant to be - the fights are more realistic  in that they're less like choreographed dance routines  but there's some wirework and occasional cgi that put the film in wu xia mode. The film doesn't have the best cast  unfortunately  with the leads being a tad lacking in charm and occasionally difficult to distinguish from each other. There's a young lady in the film that I don't think I've seen before  but makes the best impression of any of the principle cast - not just because you see her nekkid... or perhaps it is :p The film lacks the charm and grace of the better HK wu xia films  and perhaps the beauty too  but I only wish HK would make them half this good anymore - TWINS EFFECT 2 does not give me hope that *that's* about to happen any time soon  though Tsui Hark surely still has it in him if he can get the funding and cast. SWORD IN THE MOON is not going to go onto my list of favourite wu xia by any means  but it's a whole heap better than ROMANTIC WARRIORS or LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE - perhaps better than BICHUNMOO too  though I did like that film quite a bit more on a second viewing. Obviously it's nowhere near the wonderful MUSA  but it's a different affair altogether really. SITM will probably get a second viewing within three years  which is perhaps the best indicator of how much I liked it :) 7/10,positive
Spawned by the same Monty Berman / Dennis Spooner partnership which produced The Champions and Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) - the latter retitled My Partner the Ghost for the US market - Department S remains a classic example of the action-adventure series which the UK produced in bulk during the late 1960s. Like those two shows  its internal dynamic of two guys and a girl might seem to indicate a progressive attitude towards equality (Dept S also has a black superior)  but it's mostly facade: the launch episode  Six Days  is barely halfway through before Rosemary Nichols is called upon to parade around in bra  panties and one (yes  one) stocking in order to extricate herself from a dodgy situation. Still  it's an interesting time capsule  even if the appalling fashion sense of Peter Wyngarde's character (which  amazingly  degenerated even further in the spin-off series Jason King) should definitely have remained buried.,positive
With all due respect to Joel Fabiani and Rosemary Nicolls and their characters  Department S will be forever associated with Peter Wyngarde's Jason King.<br /><br />Most people remember him as this camp  flamboyant and debonair womaniser cum detective in the mould of Austin Powers but that will do a disservice to the character: He's far more nuanced than that.<br /><br />Jason King is lazy (he often lets Stewart fight all the bad guys and only chips in at the end)  he is egotistical (his appreciation of people is based on whether they've read his novels or not)  a lot of his detective work is speculation without facts to back them up and he sulks whenever Annabelle is right...and she often is. He's clearly a man having a mid-life crisis and drink drives but.......Jason King is brilliant. If Wyngarde had played him purely as a dashing hero  it wouldn't have worked but he shows King often as a paper tiger  led by his libido  love of finery and prone to grandstanding (and it gets in the way of his detective work at times) but he has some of the best lines and put downs in TV history. And by not playing him as whiter-than-white  the chemistry and interactions between the three lead characters is all the better for it.<br /><br />Watching it again on DVD recently  you get to see just how much depth Wyngarde put into Jason King.,positive
This is a piece of cinematic beauty  and it shows more of Quebec culture to others than probably any other work to come from la belle province. It takes everybody into a first-person experience of the culture  to the point that you wish you glued your hair in place and lived  breathed  and ate everything Maurice Richard. The book does this as well as the short  and I'm glad that in all the time I did spend studying French in high school  this was required reading in both languages.<br /><br />I thought it was brilliant to have Roch Carrier narrate this story. His molasses-thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story. The animation was good  as well  very surrealist  which brings attention to the idea of this being a whimsical daydream  fancying over better days gone by.<br /><br />Again  as a symbol of culture quebecoise  this is unsurpassed. One can almost smell the tourtiere being cooked slowly over a wood stove. This whole film deserves endless praise for making people proud to be Canadian  and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots. I'm from Ontario  and this film made me fall in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard va toujours vivre dans nos coeurs.,positive
Created by Dennis Spooner  'Department S' was a glossy thriller show about an offshoot of Interpol  based in Geneva  created to solve baffling mysteries the police could not handle. If a plane landed at Heathrow with no-one aboard  if a man was found wandering around London in a space-suit  if the passenger of a Rolls Royce suddenly transmogrified into a skeleton  if a train pulling into a tube station turned out to contain dead commuters  you called on 'Department S' to sort things out.<br /><br />Peter Wyngarde played 'Jason King'  a flamboyantly dressed crime novelist whose fertile imagination helped crack many of the bizarre cases. King caught the public's fancy and was later awarded a spin-off show. He was ably assisted by American 'Stuart Sullivan' ( Joel Fabiani ) and the delectable 'Annabelle Hurst' ( Rosemary Nicols ). Unusually for a '60's show  the department was headed by a black man - 'Sir Curtis Seretse' ( Dennis Alaba Peters ) If the show looked and felt a lot like 'The Avengers'  it was hardly surprising. It shared many of the same writers and directors! The colourful titles were designed by Chambers & Partners  and are worth tuning in for alone. As was the case with so many I.T.C. series  the music was composed by Edwin Astley. His theme for 'Department S' has got to rank as one of the best television themes of all time.<br /><br />Predictably  the show looks a little sexist and dated now  but don't let that dissuade you from tuning in. Imagine a hybrid of 'Jonathan Creek' and the 'Austin Powers' movies and you've got 'Department S'!<br /><br />Trivia Note: the episode 'A Small War Of Nerves' features a young Sir Anthony Hopkins in a major role!,positive
Like NIGHT STALKER and then X-FILES  the show set up a fantastic situation and the main characters had to sort it out. Unlike these  the hero(es) weren't left holding an empty bag at the end. They had usually tangible results. It was also made clear that the 'good guys' were in a dirty profession where they occasionally had to pull some nasty things. Imagination  wit  acting which didn't always take itself too seriously ... I miss it. One reason being  I'm hard pressed to think of too many shows - BANACEK aside - which did as good a job of taking the viewer and grabbing their attention right off the bat. The writers excelled at setting up hugely improbable  if not downright impossible situations which the characters then had to find an explanation to. explanations which often took 90 degree turns into the clearly unexpected yet  for all that  still made sense. Too  I agree with another reviewer that the Anabelle character was somewhat underused  but when she was on screen  it wasn't just for eye candy. She was quite competent in her own right and stood up to the two male leads when she felt the point she was making warranted it. A rarity in those days. Sullivan? If he wasn't in the Department  he'd be working for the KGB or CIA. He's that sort of coldly efficient  ruthless type. He knows how the world works and realizes what it can take to get the job done. King? It's clearly a game to him. One he excels at and which he parleys into ideas for the detective/spy novels he writes as his ostensible 'real' job. He's probably the most fun to watch of the three  although they all have their moments and often  too. I do agree that the eventual spin-off series featuring only his character lacked the interest of the original  however.,positive
The incomparable Laura Gemser appeared briefly in an erotic scene from the French Emmanuelle 2. This amazing woman did not go unnoticed  and was soon cast as the lead in this all new Italian series  where she is the centerpiece; a beautiful photojournalist who travels the world experiencing all the mysterious eroticism that the world had to offer. In this first installment  Mae Jordan/Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the people as well as the stunning landscape and wild exotic animals. Much like Sylvia Kristels character  Emanuelle has not come into her own when it comes to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality. This first film is basically about how she becomes the Emanuelle that most exploitation cinema fans are familiar with. Filled with gorgeous cinematography  beautiful people  and an intoxicating 70's score from the legendary Nico Fidenco  this one is sure to please. Those who enjoy the more story-driven style of the original french Emmanuelle should definitely like this as well. The main story here being an interesting cat and mouse tale of a womanizing playboy who comes to the realization that he has fallen in love with a woman who is the female version of him! Sexy  fun and totally entertaining throughout; a soap opera to be sure  but one with enough skin and general eye candy to keep the male viewers entertained. For some reason this is the hardest one in the series to find on DVD. there has never been a legitimate DVD for this  which is very strange. The bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do until someone gives this diamond of a film a proper release.,positive
You know you're watching softcore with the wrong attitude when the poor dubbing bothers you. I'm okay with the crappy lip syncing but the sound mix is really of too. Every time someone says anything it sounds like there's a narrator. Either way  this is pretty much the purgatory between boring French professionalism and the heavenly campy Joe D'Amato flicks involving cannibalism and whatnot. Don't get me wrong  there's a fair dose of exploitation in this one  but there's always room for more. Laura Gemser stars  and that's good because she's hot. It's a bit freaky how at times you can see her bone structure  but she still rules over her white counterpart. You can also make a cool drinking game of how often she takes her kit of. Often. Every reason is good. Every person is good. Every location is good. One scene even involves an entire hockey team  whatever they are doing in Africa. Sometimes the plot gets in the way  and the supporting cast consists of some really vile looking people  but there's enough Laura Gemser for all.,positive
Laura Gemser plays a magazine photographer who is sent to Africa for a photo shoot. There she is met by a couple and other swinging couples. They all stay at this huge  very touristy hotel with a gigantic swimming pool. One night they have a pool party complete with real live native dancers. It's very un-politically correct and very kitschy. Later  Emanuelle finally has her photo shoot  which turns out to be in one of those drive-through  stay-in-your-car safaris (albeit the photography is gorgeous). Throughout the film  Emanuelle is going after every man she meets. The photography is very well done in this film. There are scenes with cascading waterfalls  galloping giraffes and ancient ruins. The film is worth seeing for the soundtrack by Nico Fidenco alone.,positive
The first of the Italian rip-offs of the French soft porn blockbuster (though it might be interesting to note that the boot-shaped country actually got their first with Cesare Canevari's 1968 IO  EMMANUELLE starring Erika Blanc) is a very different kettle of fish than the sleazy sequels provided by the late  questionably great Joe D'Amato. It is much closer in spirit to the now very dated Just Jaeckin film from 1973  taking a pokerfaced look at male/female relationships  questioning such then hot topics as fidelity and jealousy  all in luxurious exotic surroundings. Unlike D'Amato  director Albert Thomas (aka Adalberto Albertini  who also made the hard to find YELLOW EMANUELLE  actually a sexed-up version of MADAME BUTTERFLY !) does not present us with predatory drug lords  snuff movie makers or rampaging cannibals  making for an admittedly less sensational yet far more erotic viewing experience.<br /><br />Photo journalist Mae Jordan aka 'Emanuelle' (lovely Java-born Laura Gemser in her first lead role following bit parts as a Thai masseuse in EMMANUELLE 2 and an 'unspoilt native' in Just Jaeckin's portion of the rarely seen COLLECTIONS PRIVEES) flies down to Nairobi where she's to shoot the stills accompanying an article by noted British writer Anne  played by the very Teutonic Karin Schubert with a butch haircut that takes some getting used to. Anne shares an 'open relationship' (remember when this was made) with her Italian husband Gianni (Angelo Infanti)  meaning that both pretty much jump anything with a pulse. Contrary to her subsequent reputation  Emanuelle appears positively reticent compared to her heavy breathing hosts  smoldering seductively at Gianni by way of foreplay until the exquisitely tantalizing pay-off. Okay  so she does make up for this lack of wantonness at the end when she does an entire male hockey team on the train. I kid you not.<br /><br />Production on this sexploitation classic is quite impressive  especially the superb cinematography. And Nico Fidenco's musical theme is a solid favorite of anyone with more than a passing interest in the genre  a hilarious Eurotrash pop ditty (try to make out those totally nonsensical lyrics and have a full evening's worth of fun with the family !) that turns up throughout the entire film in every conceivable type of rendition from slow 'n' sexy to hip-gyrating disco.<br /><br />This is entirely Laura Gemser's show though. Billed simply as 'Emanuelle' (as was another actress on the same director's elusive EMANUELLE NERA 2)  she lights up the screen from start to finish. Not yet submitted to endless rape scenarios (as she would be once D'Amato took over)  she seems much more relaxed than in later films  even smiling from time to time  a rare occasion as anyone who has seen some of the lady's work surely knows. A flawless Eurasian rather than as the title suggests black beauty (she hails from Dutch India now Indonesia and is actually quite close in physical appearance to the supposed author of the novel Emmanuelle Arsan)  she projects a slightly passive  even submissive sensuality which somehow detaches her from the 'depravity' her morally corrupted cohorts indulge in. Unlike the French film  cheapskate moralizing is kept to a bare minimum  almost thrown in as an afterthought near film's end when Emanuelle tells Gianni that he hasn't lost her as he never possessed her to begin with. I swear you could hear audiences of the Just Jaeckin version groan whenever Alain Cuny's supremely irritating Mario showed up on screen as it meant we were in for too many minutes of halfbacks libertine philosophizing as an alibi for getting the divine Sylvia Kristel (now living in the Belgian capital of Brussels by the way...) to disrobe  the real reasons theaters were packed for years on end. Gemser's later husband  Gabriele Tinti (now deceased  she has remarried)  appears on the sidelines as the constantly drunk 'Scottish' (huh ?) writer who forces himself briefly on Emanuelle amid the African ruins at some point  but no real sex scene though.,positive
The main reason to check this one out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory.<br /><br />That's reason enough for me.<br /><br />She heads to Africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films.

I have so much hope for the sequel to Gen-X. Luckily  my hopes have came true. You got a whole bunch of action  comedy...silly comedy  and surprises. I think the newcomer Edison  is really a hit in the movie  but I really find Sam's 'Alien' stupidly annoying with English. Although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue  the action always keeps it strong. The action set-up is much stronger than the 1st.<br /><br />This movie is getting more of an American feel since 60% of the movie is in English from the Cantonese. This movie will not disappoint you. I recommended this for young 'uns that care about pure action-packed fun.<br /><br />,positive
"I think this movie has got it all. It has really cool music that I can never get out of my head. It has cool looking characters. IS REALLY funny(you know  the kind that you'll crack up on the ground and you'll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks).Despite the bad acting  bad cgi  and bad story(about cops going after a robot)  its really cool. Its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch  get together  eat pizza  laugh like crazy  and watch it two more times.<br /><br />There are so many funny parts  like when Kurt was trying to get Edison's attention and gave him the finger  and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball. On that part  I kept saying Remember, Remember?to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened. There was also a really funny part when Edision ran into the room and Kurt was there(just before they fought) and Kurt was talking about his Strange dream and how he was Superman. I LOVED that part  although it has been a while since I saw it  so I don't remember that part. Everything the actors said were funny  like how Kurt says  I worship you, like a GOD! to the robot.<br /><br />Although there was some bad things  in all it was a GREAT movie. Man  I can't stop laughing. I wish I had that movie. );",positive
I'm a Petty Officer 1st Class (E-6) and have been in the USCG for 6 years and feel that this movie strongly represents the Coast Guard. There were only a few scenes that were far fetched. The most far-fetched was when PO Fischer (Kutcher) went down inside of the sinking vessel to pull the vessel's captain out of the engine room... that would never happen. Swimmers are not allowed to go inside of any vessel no matter the circumstances. Second  the Command Center (supposedly in Kodiak)  it looked more like a NASA command center... we don't have any gear that hi-tech. Third  the Captain of the Airstation would not be running the search & rescue cases with like 10 people on watch. In reality it would be an E-6 or E-7 as the SAR Controller and maybe 2 other support personnel like an assist SAR Controller & a Radio Watchstander. Otherwise the movie was dead on  I think they should have incorporated more of the other rates in the CG and their roles in search & rescue instead of just Aviation based rates. Some of the scenes from A school reminded me of my days their and the dumb stuff I did and got in trouble for in my younger days.,positive
Gen-Y Cops...since I heard of the film being in release  I have been wanting to see it because I loved Gen-X Cops. I was a little disappointed that A) Nicholas Tse didn't return and B) too much slapstick. Nevertheless  I enjoyed the sequel because it may not be good as the first film  but it is good in its own way.<br /><br />Stephen Fung returns as the ultracool ladies man Match  who has a steady girl in Oli (NOTE: Where is Haze?) and Sam Lee returns as the insane Alien (this time sporting a mohawk and speaking a lot of English!!!!). The real star of the film is newcomer Edison Chen. He makes a great replacement for Nicholas Tse as...Edison. I also enjoyed Paul Rudd's performance of Agent Curtis...he seems to be the tough as nails  smartmouth FBI Agent you'd love to hate...but soon  you'd like his character.<br /><br />The fight scenes are a lot better in this one...even though there are very few  but they are great  courtesy of Jackie Chan stuntman Nicky Li.<br /><br />Look for a cameo from Ron Smoorenburg as a cage fighter who has a teeny little fight with Match. Smoorenburg also is the stunt double for Rudd.<br /><br />If you liked GEN-X COPS...you'll love GEN-Y COPS!!!,positive
This film is great. All the hi-tech machinery and technology is mind-boggling. It is packed with action  humour and not to mention  guys. You will want to see it again and again. Very very funny. Also  it has a very unique plot which is unpredictable. You wouldn't want to miss out on it.,positive
I am having a holiday in hong kong now  and i just saw gen y cops at the cinema.... what can i say... it was sooo cool!!<br /><br />Everything you could wish for was in it! Basically... just see it if ya can... I'm gonna get my friend to send me the vcd when it comes out....<br /><br />Only bad thing was the dodgy American style of talking employed by some of the hl actors... like Edison... What's up my man?! but it did add even more humour to iy... hhehe<br /><br />See it... especially if ya like any of the following geners: HKfilm  action  comedy  sci fi! SEEITMAN!! Edison did a good song for it too... so download it... Edison Tse - Heroes,positive
This is a well done action movie. There are plenty of fight scenes  the acting is convincing (for this genre) and RS1 is awesome. I don't know why people feel compelled to trash RS1  I thought his effects were executed very nicely and his design looked great. The plot was acceptable for a martial arts movie.<br /><br />Having said that  I must tell you Richard Sun is one of the worst actors from Hong Kong I have ever watched. At least RS1 had the right idea by killing him. Now  for all of you who thought Sam Lee (Alien) was a bad actor...he wasn't meant to be taken seriously! I have just had the pleasure of watching Gen-X Cops (prequel) and Sam Lee played the same character the same way!<br /><br />Now  please  all of you guys who watch highly reviewed Oscar winners: DO NOT JUDGE THIS IS A THINKING MAN'S MOVIE! IT ISN'T SUPPOSED TO REQUIRE THOUGHT! Just meant to be enjoyed  that's all. I hope they make another soon.,positive
Genius or utter madness? That depends on your interpretation of this film. I responded to it on the level of a self-aware cop-movie parody  and I sincerely hope that was the intention as I don't see anyone taking it seriously! :-D Paul Rudd for one seems to be chewing up the scenery and really getting into the spirit of things! Is this film supposed to mark a departure for Rudd from his core background in the comedy genre? Some kind of insane attempt to reinvent him as a hard-boiled action star? I think not! <br /><br />With the cheesy  almost awkward acting  low budget FX  and zany over-the-top action set pieces  it all kinda evoked that old TV show Sledge Hammer for me! HILARIOUS!!! :-)<br /><br />Of course  I may have totally interpreted the film wrong. If it was in fact an attempt at a 'straight' action movie  then it was certainly an amusing failure!!<br /><br />Watch with lots of alcohol and some mates!!! ;-),positive
this movie is certainly worth a watch. it's full of action. it's also humorous. you'll laugh until your stomach hurts if you watch this movie. this movie also includes lots of hi-tech things hence the name gen-y. i recommend you to watch the prequel of this movie which is gen-x.,positive
This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments but overall the movie relies a bit too much on just one comical premise.<br /><br />The comical premise this movie mostly relies on is very simple; Stan Laurel not wearing any pants. Laurel plays a Scottish naive young person who arrives in America in full kilt. For some reason he gets the center of attention because of this and his uncle played by Oliver Hardy thinks because of this that its time to put some pants on Philip.<br /><br />Its humor is well executed but the main premise also gets a bit tiresome after a while. Although the movie definitely still has its comical great moments  it at the same time is also far from the best of the many Laurel & Hardy comedy shorts that are still around. The movie is simply too simple to be considered one of the greatest  although it definitely is most fine executed all  for most part.<br /><br />Great good clean fun  just nothing too remarkable or memorable all.<br /><br />7/10,positive
This is one of L&H's shorts most frequently cited as the first real L&H teaming and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who has come to the docks to greet his nephew Philip  whom he's never seen. At first Ollie is laughing it up with everyone when this strange little man unboards and draws a great deal of attention to himself by the way he's behaving during his medical exam  but is quite humiliated when it turns out that this is the fellow he's supposed to be greeting. He has been told that Philip is a good boy  but he has one weakness--women. Mumblethunder and Philip set off to go home  but their journey there is continually interrupted by Philip breaking into a little dance every time he sees a woman  then chasing after the woman. Huge crowds gather each time this happens  not so much because he's chasing skirts  but because Philip himself is also wearing a skirt (a kilt). Finally Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a tailor's shop to be measured for a proper pair of pants  but Philip escapes from there as well to chase more skirts. There are lots of laughs all around. It's also nice to see a short like this because the boys aren't exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is pretty much his usual character  but it's such a joy to see Stan acting so differently from his usual man-child character. It shows he wasn't a one-trick pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance. With a run time of 19 minutes its short and sweet  providing classic one liners which still have me in stitches.,positive
Stan Laurel regarded PUTTING PANTS ON PHILIP as the first true' L&H film. THE SECOND HUNDRED YEARS was the first 'official' L&H film  but this was the one where Stan completely resigned himself not only to performing (he had signed on with the Hal Roach Studios as a director and 'gag-man'  before certain situations - among them Oliver Hardy's accident with a leg of lamb leading to Stan having to replace him; and the extra money that performing would provide for himself and his new wife  Lois - brought about his historic return to performing  as well as writing  directing  editing and involvement in other areas of production)  but also realised the fact that he was part of a team that worked well together. This  therefore  is an historic and very important film in the history of comedy.<br /><br />It is also a surprisingly funny little silent film; rather different from what Laurel & Hardy would become known for and from what they are more immediately associated with today. The characters of 'Stan & Ollie do not appear - Scottish Stan Laurel plays the nephew of Oliver Hardy  a respectable man about town who is reluctant to be seen with this strange-looking fellow with a kilt and the habit of chasing pretty girls. There are some very funny moments in this well-made  charming little movie  and the performances of these two Kings of Comedy are spot-on - watch Stan's little 'scissor-kick' and smile that says  Well waddaya know? when he sees girls  or the hair-ruffling scene at the airport  for instance. Hilarious.<br /><br />Watch this film if you can  with backing music from The Beau Hunks Orchestra (available on the VVL video releases) which enhances the 1920s feel and is very  very pleasant to listen to. It's a brilliant and underrated little film  which is why I said it was 'surprisingly' funny.,positive
Transcendental  sophisticated  incisive  emotive  powerful... I could think of a hundred adjectives to describe this fantastic work of art and intelligence  and still I would feel they were insufficient. All I can really say is that I am infatuated with this film. Applause to Krzysztof Kieslowski  Zbigniew Preisner  Irène Jacob  and Jean-Louis Trintignant. May Rouge live forever.,positive
I throughly enjoyed this short  even as a Toronto Maple Leafs fan. <br /><br />Director Sheldon Cohen and Narrator Roch Carrier captured all of the boy's emotions perfectly. From the feelings he had for his hero  Maurice Rocket Richard  to the excitement  anticipation and hope of getting a new Montreal Canadiens sweater soon  to the look of horror on his face when he got his sweater from his mother; A Toronto Maple Leafs sweater was priceless and the shame of having to wear this dreadful (in his eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leafs sweater; Not the rouge  bleu and blanc of the Montreal Canadiens with Richard's number nine  like his old sweater. And worst of all  his Mum made him wear this Maple Leafs sweater out of the house. You could envision and anticipate the ridicule he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that sweater before he got there.<br /><br />I was laughing the whole time and this is one of the best animated shorts I've seen.<br /><br />,positive
What some Hollywood-movies try and practically never succeed  creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons (without becoming unrealistic)  manages this beautiful movie perfectly well (resembling in that way a little to the wonderful 'La Double Vie de Veronique' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress). This is a REAL movie  that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story  masterfully directed  excellent main actors  masterful cinematography. I've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time  and I still think it's one of the best I've ever seen. And if you should be unhappy with the ending of 'White' - 'Red' puts an happy end to the whole trilogy.,positive
This movie made by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadians dynasty years in the 50's 60's and 70's. My 5th grade teacher played this in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I have been a Canadians fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. on a scale of 1-10  I give this film a 117. All hockey fans should see this as I hope it will be placed in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto and shown at the Bell Centre in Montreal or here in Edmonton at Rexall Place. Watch this film with your family it is a great movie. I also recommend the book in both French and English. Go Habs Go.,positive
A wonder. My favorite film. The most important film about relationships ever made. Brilliant writing. Magnificent directing. Image systems and symbolism that leave you thinking about it all days  weeks  years later. Wow. A truly great work of art.,positive
This movie is not only about feelings and human emotions  it is also about everything that could be but it's not. Poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying  but this movie is delightful to be watched. Not to mention the amazing Irène Jacob  a great actress in France - one of the best  actually. When the movie ends  you can only feel sorry. After all  when something is truly great  we want more (Well  for another great movie by K Kieslowsky with Irène Jacob we can always watch La double vie de Veronique),positive
"They both believed that a hidden sentiment has unified them. This certitude is beautiful,but the incertitude is more beautiful. They believed that they had never been met.Nothing has happened between them.But those roads,those stairs,those corridors for all that time they could have been met. Although it did not mean to be it was a swan song.Two young people who are neighbors and have never been met are found in the same places the same times doing most of the times the same things.They finally meet in the dramatic and very brilliant end that brings them together.Meanwhile the woman has met an old man.Their relation is brotherhood-like.He told her his life.It was like the young one's but with better prospectives.The young man can do whatever the old man has not lived.He can be happy with the woman. The ending is exceptional.There is a ship wreck.The only survivors are the heros of the Three colors.The man and the woman finally meet.The scene lasts a few seconds.The woman there looks like the photo she had taken for an ad in the beginning of the film;sad in a red fond.But every start is only the continue.The book of the life is opened in the middle.",positive
Irene Jacob is mesmerizing in this final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it succeeds in tying all three films together. I am simply in awe of the amount of talent it took to do one of these stories  let alone all three. Everything seems to fit together so precisely  all the elements of filmmaking so eloquently executed  and the end result so much greater than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs on any list of great cinematic achievements. Simply brilliant!,positive
Most of Kieslowski's films seem like puzzles to me  meant to expand mind and soul. The characters are not very believable  are idealized  are schematic. Nevertheless  the way Kieslowski presents their winding ways through life  their complicated interaction with others  with the universe  with chance or destiny  makes me understand faith  makes me (want to) believe in God. That at some point it all has a meaning  if not to me  then certainly to someone.<br /><br />Trois couleurs and especially Rouge comes closer to making me touch  feel  experience the truth  the meaning than perhaps any other of his films. The only problem being the paths of the puzzles explored are a bit too similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable. There is still plenty of joy to be had here. It is like a familiar brand of wine - you know what to expect and it delivers  sometimes with a newly found bouquet which might come from aging - either the wine or yourself.,positive
"Rouge is part of a trilogy  but very much stands on its own. It isn't a sequel of any sort. The very end  which I won't divulge  ties the three films together  but not seeing the other two doesn't make it too confusing. <br /><br />This film amazes me because it is so spare  so subtle and simple  but is as effective  emotionally and intellectually  as any big-budget spectacle or all-star melodrama. Kieslowski here investigates the phenomena of chance and destiny. Both themes are loosely woven together in the story. The film is very much a puzzle  but the message is pretty straightforward: Everything happens for a reason. Love is in all of our destinies as long as we open ourselves to it. The title  Red refers to the French flag  where red represents fraternity, or brotherhood. The color dominates the visuals of the movie. I tend to think of it as representing love or passion  or the blood of life. It's great when a film allows the freedom to do that ;)",positive
There's a spartan  unsentimental edge to this film that allows plenty of room for us to participate in the action without any stylistic encumbrance telling us HOW we're meant to be feeling; in 'Blue'  everything was overtly sad (sure  powerful as hell  but still); in 'White'  it was delightful whimsy. But there are no such emotional clues  or cues for that matter  in this one. It's as if he finally let the force of the tale work its own magic without razzle-dazzle embelishment. I think that's what makes it the most initially enigmatic of the three  but finally  the most transcendent and redemptive. Never has remorseless  unsparing honesty been quite so beautiful.,positive
Valentine Dogkiller Dussaut and Joe The Judge Kern join forces to clean up the mean streets of Geneva! Thrill as they put the kibosh on international heroin smugglers  Polish fugitives  peeping toms  philandering girlfriends  renegade dogs  and litterbugs who are too lazy to bin their recyclables. Don't be fooled by the deceptive Miramax ad campaign that paints it as a pretentious  art house flick. This movie is 100% action!,positive
I use IMDB very much. Mainly reading comments of other people about movies I´ve or not seen. I´ve thought it was time to write a few words about this movie that changed my life  and the way I look a movie. I think I have seen it at least a dozen times since autumn 94  when I saw it in the theatre for the first time.<br /><br />I feel Kieslowski is one of the best directors of all time. And I think this is his best one. It was his last one. I was very sad the day I knew he has died  because sure we lost the chance to get something more from him.<br /><br />RED is just the best Kieslowski + incredibile performance by Trintignant & Jacob + cinematography by Sobocinski. If you haven´t seen it LOOK FOR it!!! If you have  just come back to it!!<br /><br />Red: just a masterpiece. please  forgive my poor English!  reader,positive
The greatest movie ever.<br /><br />How's that for a contention? However  if we look at it through purely cinematic terms  it is clear that Three Colours Red is a masterpiece. It is not enough to merely say this - Three Colours Red is the masterpiece of world cinema. If you accept that Citizen Kane is not human enough  if you accept that Star Wars is not actually very good  if you accept that Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colours Red is the foremost masterpiece of all time. As a discussion into human morality  Three Colours Red works on an intensely metaphysical level  with a depth that none can match. Blue went almost as far into the human psyche  but stopped as it was going to pull the rabbit out of the hat. White forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - this  in retrospect  was better still  but still not quite there. Red  however  is the real thing. What he expresses in this movie  is an expression of what it is to be human. In fact  what he expresses is _how_ it is to feel human. It forces us to examine up to the minutest detail  the very nature of our souls  of our ethical selves. In Red  one may find meaning on one of its several levels. On the first level  Red achieves a high level of verisimilitude - we could have no trouble in calling Red an exceptionally entertaining story. However  the coincidences inherent in the film and its conceits force us to examine the movie as a movie. It is as if Kieslowski is saying: Ceci n'est pas la réalité. In effect  in pursuing a humanistic goal  Kieslowski can also challenge reality. It is a trick that Kieslowski has been attempting since Le Double Vie de Véronique  but not until this  his final film  did he finally manage to reach this divine intertwining of fate  philosophy and circumstance. The actors and actresses  too  appear to be at the mercy of a greater power. Valentine (Irène Jacob)  is aptly name  for she seems to represent an almost pure love. Meanwhile  the idea of first impressions is challenged by Jean-Louis Tritignant's Judge Kern  a cantankerous man  who  by the end  becomes an almost all-knowing observer of events - a character who symbolically seems to possess the power to bring characters together - a power to make people happy  a power which he could only achieve through Valentine.<br /><br />We have a capability to see films as more than just a series of pictures. In fact  films have the potential to possess more meaning than literature. It won't happen  of course  but at least we have the power to view this film  knowing that it gives us the power to achieve the something that we can't define  but all possess. A synopsis of this film read: A film about a woman who runs over a dog. Well  it is.<br /><br />Isn't it?<br /><br />-Simon Huxtable<br /><br />,positive
This is a classic continuation to Bleu  the likewise excellent film  with Juliet Binouche as a main star  moreover  she is a cameo appearance here  in Rouge  just for a second at the very end. But this film  truly red and very sweet although very sad  is a real winner. The main heroine  played by ever great Irene Jakob  is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full  active life  only darkened by her traumatic relations with her weird friend Mike  who is in England. By some lucky chance  she gets friendly with the old Judge  who spends time listening to the private telephone talks of his neighbors. The story starts to weave even further  and we see him in court  being almost universally condemned for his pastime. She is the only one who feels sympathy for him  for his cute doggy Rita and her pups  and for all the people who surround them. We also witness the break-up of a happy couple of a young lawyer and his lady  and their quarrel is also fueled by that telephone scandal... But the film is not about this  even. It is mostly about the loneliness and deep rifts between people  far and near. When she sails to England on a ferry  with that lawyer as a chance fellow-passenger  as well as that earlier mentioned Binoche who starred in Bleu  the ship sinks and we see the horrified look of The Judge when he watches the news trying to guess if she survived. She did  and still we feel very heavy at heart. Mr. Kislowski managed to draw a grand  subtle story about the solitude  misunderstanding  secrets and pain. Deep  dark personal pain of those who are lost and lonely. Brilliant film.,positive
In my analysis of Trois couleurs: Blanc I wrote that its tone is much lighter than the tone of Trois couleurs: Bleu. I think it's the same with this film. This time it's not because of a tragic comedy-element  but much more because of the main character Valentine. Although her boyfriend is living abroad and is ridiculously jealous  she manages her life with lightness and optimism  it seems to me that she might be Kieslowski's image for a carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge  who is very pessimistic  a grumpy old man  who experiences big loneliness. In my view  Valentine and the judge are pretty similar to each other  the judge is just much older and has experienced many more disappointments. They share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn much from the other one. Finally I would like to stress Irène Jacob's performance  she rounds off the run of amazing female contributions to the Three Colours-trilogy.,positive
Well every scene so perfectly presented. Never before had I seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene.<br /><br />Well while I was watching this movie I remembered watching Amilie. Amilie is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch. These movies are both based on a same plot line. But both of them are Perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own.<br /><br />Red is able to provoke lots of thoughts in people about destiny and dejavu s. And I am still thinking about it.<br /><br />The story is great and the ending is a bit funny. I was laughing in the end scene. Well funny how this three movie Red White and Blue are connected.<br /><br />All in all a great work of art. A work of a masterman.<br /><br />10/10,positive
I believe I share the same psychological outlook on the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish  I am Dutch  yet we share a synthetic mind: the world is not void of the metaphysical amidst total coincidence. Hardly ruled by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister  so that as a social and cultural 'low pressure area'  Poland could play the role it did in WWII  being critical yet Christian towards the Jews but often not less critical toward oneself. There are innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's world view  as the symbols in Catholicism: the White versus the Black Madonna. In Rouge  the Black Madonna is she who the judge fell in love with when he was a young man. Flashbacks are magically-realistically intertwined with the present  although totally coincidental  such as the camera simply swinging to the other side of the street or the then young judge's red jeep passing by the now young woman's car after she accidentally hit his dog with it. That we leaped through time in those same camera moves  is what we grasp later. His love was unanswered  so that his life wasn't as he had planned it. He lost his ability to love other people and animals. Being a judge  he feels he is actually spying on other peoples' lives and when he retires  he simply continues to do so  spying on his neighbors this time. The innocence and sense of righteousness of the younger woman (literally) accidentally getting into his life  reinstalls his better judgment and it is because of her that he spontaneously confesses his spying behavior to his neighbors and the police  accepting and even holding on to the stones consequentially thrown through his windows. In the process  history repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves  although this time he is old and the woman not the same. Kieslowski may have wrestled with this bit for the old judge is his alter ego  and it is said he was infatuated by Irène Jacob. Both women play the same essential role in his psychology  of the one (!) who possesses his heart and soul and therefore can make him or break him  even as an old man! It is as if the 'powers in the air' are  or God is  bringing them together. Coincidences are *too* coincidental to just be chance or even good luck. There has to be some mystical  supernatural or theological source influencing these unfathomably deep life-decisions. The study book fell and opened at the page of the exam question is another example of this. Or the moment the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman  the wind outside the opera house suddenly slams the open doors and breaks the windows. The gigantic picture of the young woman happens to predict the one on TV  after the drowning accident on her Canal crossing trip. These moments are effectively accentuated through the human voice of liturgy or what sounds like it (Van den Budenmayer).,positive
Are we allowed to interfere with our fellowmen's everyday's life? Is it possible to intrude upon their intimacy  to penetrate the inwardness of their thoughts violating the privacy of their own home without being blamed? The director raises some doubts about these apparently solvable questions  almost sympathetic towards judge Jean Luis' destabilizing decision of coming to terms with his own inducted self-seclusion by means of fragments of lives embezzled by him.<br /><br />Trois couleurs: Rouge is based on the concept of UNIVERSAL COMMUNICATION CONCEIVED AS THE HUMAN DESIRE OF AN OPEN WINDOW ON THE WORLD. The phone may be considered the main character of the story: after its performance in Dekalog 9 it gives in the beginning the encore to Kieslowski's onlookers  followed step by step in its fast run across the world. The director looks deeply into the faculty of communication of human beings  without taking up a definite position about the ethical side of individual behavior. Once again he points out to us the unpredictability of future events  venting careful descriptions about strange courses and recourses of life separated from each other by a considerable number of years. Inexplicable combinations oddly converging in a series of continuous and upsetting situations. - Some books falling to the pavement. - One of them opening casually on a fatal page  predetermining the destiny of a future profession  as in a past similar occurrence. - Glimpses of daily life meeting fleetingly  ideally joined by their fondness for the fictitious musician Van den Budermayer. - Human fortunes marked by the most ill-fated coincidence.<br /><br />In this piece of work deserving to be seen with our heart's eyes instead of our mind's ones we can witness a dialectic game between judge Jean Luis' (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and Valentine Dussaut (Irene Jacob  maybe the sweetest actress of our times  together with the beautiful Winona Ryder)  in a generational conflict between the experience of a world-weary old man and the self-conscious immaturity of a nice girl on the point of facing the steepest path of her ascending way. Kieslowski talks about dialogue tests between a disappointed human life and a youth unaware of her future  between a spiritless misanthropist and a spontaneous girl full of good sense of unselfishness.<br /><br />And the final parade when the damp odor of tragedy still lingers in the air  with all the main characters of the whole trilogy in full evidence  saved by an accidental stroke of luck thank to the providential script cleverly written  gives us the extreme greetings of this movie master fully used up by his great passion for cinema. Only a sense of bitter regret and emptiness is left to remind us the existence of a void impossible to fill. GOOD-BYE KRZYSZTOF. WE MISS YOU SO MUCH!,positive
Master Kieslowsky came with an idea in 1993  the idea was to portrait how human relationship are in the world today  passing from Blue (a crafted visual masterpiece about a woman's life) from White (A visual comedy movie about marriage) and finally arriving to Red (A masterpiece dealing with human interaction).<br /><br />While I'm not going to spoil the move I can easily say Red is the best movie from the 90's decade because it has one of the strongest messages in a script I have ever ever seen.<br /><br />The movie begins a little slow but finds it's rhythm early enough to keep you hooked through the whole movie.<br /><br />The performances are perfect  sublime. since the characters are completely realistic and they're not clichéd in any way and one could expect no less from the actors and one doesn't get disappointed... seriously I believe Jean Louis Tringtignat deserved an Oscar nod at least.<br /><br />The music from Zbiegnew Preisner is amazing it's one of the best musical scores ever. Piotr Sobocinsk Cinematography is also outstanding he got an Oscar nod for it (and deserved to win).<br /><br />Overall the movie is a perfect 10 and will be loved by people that love foreign cinema and people who don't. Don't Miss it.<br /><br />How did the awful Pulp Fiction beat ed this masterpiece at Cannes is beyond my comprehension,positive
Trilogies are very interesting. Some go out with a bang (Lord of the Rings)  some get progressively weaker (The Matrix)  some get lost in obscurity (Blade  Back to the Future)  but some maintain the genius  that seemingly ever-growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless exterior. Case and point: Three Colors Trilogy. This chapter in the trilogy  being the last one  is the most philosophical and thought-provoking. In Blue we had a more visually stunning  more character-driven plot  in White it was more of a light hearted  narrative-driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything. Red  however is focused on the what ifs and how comes. It questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the present.<br /><br />This chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings him back to his owner. She soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors' phone calls through advanced spying equipment. All three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines  but bring a lot more to the story. Consider in Blue  the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary French society and how that reflects the character's behavior. Red is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man's life  but it is also about chance  hope  and fate.<br /><br />Irene Jacob stars as Valentine Dussaut  who at first finds the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant)  whom we never find the name of  extremely self-centered and disgusting. Though through self reflective analysis  and her voyeuristic intentions  she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her  if only he was 40 years younger. Irene lives across from another  younger judge  who highly resembles the old man. This is the what if that keeps circling in the movie. What if Irene were born 40 years ago? The old man would have been her perfect match. But what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match  since he so closely resembles the older one. Valentine doesn't know this  only we do  and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame which Irene is in. We are constantly smacked in the face with his presence  as almost a suggestion of Irene's fate.<br /><br />I mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason. That reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story. We are to compare the old judge to Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit)  the younger judge  in more than one way. We learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away. In another scene  we see Auguste heartbroken as the love of his life gets away with another man. There are constant reminders of whether or not Valentine will ever meet this man. Even though they pass each other without noticing every single day. There is also the motif of the telephone  to Valentine it is a way of keeping sane and updating her life  to Auguste it is what leads to his heartbreak  and to the old man  it is the only thing he has left. These three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology. It is a sort of statement about what they are and who they are.<br /><br />All three Colors films stand for a certain principle  most common in France. Blue stands for Liberty (the personal being)  White stands for Equality (being accepted by more than one)  and Red is Fraternity (to socialize  to learn). And although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the Fraternity principle  Kieslowski makes sure he brings in the other two as well  in order to connect all three stories. For example  we see the old man trying to reach out to Valentine and enlighten her with his spy equipment  which is a reflection of the Equality principle. We also see near the end that Valentine is doing some soul searching and that she's more concerned about herself than others (not picking up the phone when Michel calls)  a clear example of Liberty. And with all three principles established  Kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well  in the final and most heartfelt scene.<br /><br />Red is about where you could have been if you were older or younger. It is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone  and whether or not one person can change your life. The final chapter in the most awe-inspiring trilogy ever made  this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling. It is not only about our modern life  but about where life could and should be in our modern time. And although the movie is more subtle than both Blue and White  it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassion.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine that Red was Kieslowski's last film  and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless  the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with Bergman  Fellini  and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who's never been awarded with an Oscar. Kieslowski  you have been missed!,positive
In the goofs section for this film there's a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where Auguste's car is seen to be parked in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene. This is incorrect. One of the views is from Auguste's flat  the other is from Valentiné's flat across the street. The whole purpose of this segment is to show how Valentiné and Auguste - who may be made for each other - almost cross paths (as happens several other times) but never quite do so  until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film. (And here there is the implication that Joseph has manipulated things so that Auguste is on that ferry  having inspected Valentiné's ticket to see which sailing she is booked on.),positive
I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada--particularly in Quebec. That's because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades. As an American  the closest thing we have to them are the New York Yankees. If you are a fan  then they are the greatest and winningest team in history. If you are not a fan  then they are Satan's team!! Well  at least that's how it was as I grew up in Washington  DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys. So I am pretty sure when this film was shown up North that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction--their national sport AND the closest thing they have to a national team in the NHL.<br /><br />Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for the Canadians AND Maurice the Rocket Richard. However  when his mother accidentally buys him a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey and forces him to wear it  I knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy. This ability to connect to the character--even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film. The way the other kids treated him and his conversation with God at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film. Very clever and memorable.,positive
Its my favourite film because there's so much going on that you don't see at first and so many things that make you wonder Did Kieslowski mean that or is it in my head? For instance - is the judge meant to be God or some supreme being ?<br /><br />Also Irene Jacob as in The Double Life Of Veronique is outstanding  there may be a few superficially prettier actresses but none who manage to convey beauty of spirit with physical beauty the way she does.<br /><br />Tritingnant also is magnificent without really saying much and the things he does say are excellent such as his answer to Valentine . . . Be.,positive
Valentine  a model in France is separated from her lover who is abroad  they plan to meet up in England  but seem to be growing ever more distant as the film progresses. One night after declining a pass made by her coworker  she hits a dog named Rita. The dog survives and she returns it to her owner  a hostile retired judge who's is living as a hermit and eavesdropper  listening in on the conversations of all his neighbours. She becomes intrigued by the nature of this man and visits him often  often becoming part of his eavesdropping games. One conversation the two listen in on is of extreme importance though  the conversation between a young soon to be judge and his wife  which we find out parallels the life of the man who is eavesdropping upon them. As we find out more about the couple  the man reveals more of his story  then continues his story  and we find out if the two men will continue towards the same fate. Little does Valentine know how her life  this encounter and the fate of the young judge will become entangled together. Her hitting the dog that day seemed to be fate  a divine sacrifice by the dog for her owner  allowing Valentine to be the saviour of the young judge  who is traveling the same path as her dear friend  to prevent him from having such a grim future  filled with loneliness and solitude. It seems the old man's dream will come true after all  and he can sleep with a smile on his face for the rest of his days.<br /><br />An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time! Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me. He is one of my favourite directors  and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema. His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible  every shot  every scene was like a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen. And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome. Usually signified with a subtle pause  or late focus in a scene  see if you can spot some. I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER  i loved the ending  how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster  with Valentine and the young judge together  and the old man watching it on her TV  solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years. I couldn't think of a better way to end the film  but a smile on my face  great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy! I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film  movies  anything...A Work of Art! 10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.,positive
and there are not many in cinema history. Rouge seems to be a bit of a hope. Hope in mankind and in life. But to say only that may be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell the story of that embittered judge and the twentish but wise model. Perhaps that old and disappointing love affair will not be repeated -there's the new couple with the young judge after the accident-. But what to say about this master of the camera? You can't miss a second of the movie because you have to watch every and each one of those faces. Kieslowski loved human beings and that is quite evident in the way the camera treats the actors. Ms. Jacob and Mr. Tringtignant are perfect It's not only this movie but the downbeat Thou shall not kill and A story about love that may you think about contemporary cinema as a way of expressing an artist's point of view. Pity American public -the average one- could not see these films. At least they are not in the Maltin's dictionary. And even the Baseline does not know what to say about this unique man. abel posadas,positive
It is not only difficult to comment separately on the three parts of Kieslowski's trilogy  it seems obvious that the filmmaker wants us to do just the opposite: view them in order  Blue  White  and Red  and consider them together as one complete work. It is true they are distinct stories with distinct themes: liberty  equality  fraternity  and each them is developed with unique applications of intrigue and artistry. They are each well worth seeing independently  but I believe they are best seen as one work. Collectively  I would rate the trilogy as a 9; separately  I place each in my top ten for the years 1993 and 1994.<br /><br />The color red is most memorable in the third movie as a backdrop in a billboard ad  the profiled model of which is the central of the movie's three main characters. The other two characters do a double-take of a varying degree of recognition when they first come upon the ad  posted larger than life alongside a busy city intersection. This ad is not a major part of the plot of this movie  yet its image becomes striking and is one of the reasons I have called Red a `mind-bending' film. This is the third of Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy  based on the Blue-White-Red of the French flag and the three parts of its motto  `Liberty  Equality  Fraternity.' The films stay primarily focused on these themes  keeping with the basic levels of one  two  or three main characters  yet with each film the complexity of plot escalates as the three principles move from fundamentally personal (Liberty  Blue) to relational (Equality  White) to social (Fraternity  Red). Red is my favorite of these films  and I give it a 9. It stands by itself as a great film  but one should see Blue and White first for the fullest effect.,positive
The final part of Kieslowski's trilogy based on the colors of the French flag finds the director at peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the cinematic image. In Red  imagery is paramount  as well as the obvious but clever color coding. However  rather than adhering to empty aesthetic contrivances based on the 'cinema du look'  Kieslowski's Red is a multi-layered  densely plotted meditation on the nature of fate and love. In Red  love and fate are intertwined but complex notions  dictated as much by the whims of human beings as the invisible parallel associations that seems to pass us by. You sense Red is really an allegory  a reenactment of Prospero's omnipresent gestures in The Tempest  yet it is more than its story appears. Red demands countless viewings  and in each viewing something new is discovered that weaves itself into the already immaculately plotted structure.<br /><br />Although Red stands alone as a masterwork from Kieslowski  it's best viewed as part of the trilogy. Elements of Blue and White are referenced in Red  which knowing viewers will enjoy.,positive
This film is not only the last piece of the Three Colours trilogy  but also the best of the three and one of the best movies of the 90s. There's hardly another movie that so wisely and consequently asks for humanity and respect for every human being. <br /><br />Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva  where she works as a model. Though she has a boyfriend  she seems to be rather lonely. One night she has an accident and injures a dog and who leads her to his owner  a retired jugde (Jean-Louis Trintignant)  who is cynical and spies his neighbors phone calls. Disgusted by him she cannot go away and they meet again. Two lonely souls meet each other and they become friends and develop a deep love for each other. <br /><br />The story itself is too complex to be told completely  there is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and Valentines real love and there is more to their relationship than only friendship.<br /><br />The actors are wonderful  Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant developing a deep and authentic friendship. <br /><br />The topics are of an endless validity  Fraternity  not only in contact with each other  but also in the respect for the right of privacy. Alarmingly we seem to loose this right more and more  which makes movies like this one even more important than it might have been in 1994.<br /><br />Red is one of the strongest colours that exists  representing inner turmoil  love  anger and passion. Used here as another protagonist  it brings a unmatched depth to the movie. A masterpiece!,positive
See Three Colors: Blue and Three Colors: White. They are both wonderful films and will give an added dimension to the finale Three Colors: Red. Red is a fantastic film. It can be enjoyed in a single viewing  and indeed  the climax of the film is very powerful in that first viewing. But  watch it again. Once you understand the use of symbolism and character parallels in this movie  you will see new things with each viewing. With the first viewing you understand that the film is the work of a brilliant mind. With each additional viewing  you find yourself discovering that it is  in fact  a work of genius. Red is meant to symbolize fraternity in the French flag. The story turns the theme of fraternity around to be viewed at angles one would never suspect. The facets of fraternity shared by the different characters is as deep as you care to peer. If you are used to the blatant symbolism in most mass films  you may find Red a bit slow. You may find yourself looking at a screen filled with intensity that you do not fathom... and yawning  wonder what all the excitement is about. This is not a mindless  vicarious experience. Everything is not explained to you. You must think as you watch. You must see... not simply look. Wonderful movie... one meant to be enjoyed by a wonderful moviegoer.,positive
This is the last film of Krzysztof Kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema. He intended to retire after this film  so in a way it is his artistic testament. He died a couple of years after making the film  and though it is said that he intended to return to directing  Destiny decided that this was indeed his last. And what a film!<br /><br />'Rouge' the last film in the three colors French trilogy is actually a very Swiss film. Set in Geneva  one of the two main characters is a Swiss retired judge  and Durenmatt immediately comes to mind. But there is more Switzerland in the cool atmosphere  in the lack of communication of the characters  in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life. Several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final  which only a great artist could have staged.<br /><br />Little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times. Yes  the film starts slowly  and the fans of the American style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers. They deserve it. The film gets quality as it advances  and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the Hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters. Cinema quality is very original  the image being a 'Study in Red'  as the title shows. Acting is fabulous  with Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant - the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age. <br /><br />A great film. Seeing it again probably adds  and I am happy to have it recorded on tape. 9/10 on my personal scale.,positive
I feel at a loss  so brilliant is this film. Kieslowski is a writer  a philosopher; and while an excellent filmmaker  his greatness lies in his writing; and Red is his paradigm. This film is a metafictional study of the artist's judgement in the creation of his fictional world; of how an artist can attempt to remake life -- even his own -- thru his art  even as he cannot escape the knowledge that  no matter how he involves himself in his story  it is still fiction and he is still outside of his remade world  still burdened with its unreality and the reality of the life he has tried to artistically remake. And magically  all of this is not to the smallest degree at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and fate and the characters who live out this story  this pre-judged destiny. If I had to choose  I might nominate this the greatest film ever made.,positive
"It's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people in on some of the ideas that Krysztoff Kieszlowski has explored in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them  and imagine myself in their world  the more I get its theme: that we are more linked to each other than we would want to think ourselves  and all it takes is a little hand of fate to set some events in motion. In BLUE  Juliette Binoche played a grieving widow whose plan to live her life without connections to the past had her meet someone unexpected. In WHITE  an act of cruelty spawns an unlikely friendship between two men who will  against the odds  conspire to bring the perpetrator to justice and full circle. And now  in RED  all the elements of fate and apparent coincidence apply themselves into the meeting of a young Genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of prying into other people's lives.<br /><br />This young girl is appropriately named: Valentine (a luminous Irene Jacob)  who has this radiance about her and even smiles openly while working the runway. Not that she is without some baggage: she has a boyfriend  unseen  who also demands to know what she is doing at all times  she has a brother who troubles her  and she rejects the advances of a photographer who is working on her image for a huge billboard. She strikes a dog while driving and nurses her back to health  but when she takes her to the owner  a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant)  he does not want her. I want nothing, he coldly says  and elements of BLUE suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man  who also lives in anonymity and apparent  free-floating freedom  conducts surveillance on unsuspecting people. This male version of Juliette Binoche's character at first shocks Valentine -- she states she can only feel pity for him as she walks away in horror  but a chance event has her back at his place  and here is when he begins revealing who he is  and his great loss.<br /><br />At the same time Kieszlowski is unfolding a parallel story: the story of a young man  Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit)  about to become a judge and who lives right across the street from Valentine -- but they keep missing each other. Chance is the word. Like Valentine winning the jackpot at the grocery story she visits  elements of chance pepper her life and Auguste's. He has a girlfriend who also supplies people with telephoned reports about the weather. One of them happens to be the old judge. He knows more about her than Auguste does  and he's never met her. Like God  or Prospero  he is slowly creating a storm which will crack the walls of this present state of conformity and bring a new meaning to the expression We meet again. It's this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes RED so beautiful and transcendent  because time is  in reality  a lot more fluid than we would like to deem it. There are people whom we meet in life that if only we had been born in similar time frames  so many things would be different.<br /><br />Such is the case with Valentine and the old judge. I believe that there is definitely a strong fraternity of souls tying them together in a tight bond: she is that woman whom he did not meet -- by chance or not -- and is  whether he knows it or not  trying to make amends  hence why he goes to the great risk of revealing his surveillance and becoming the social outcast. But it doesn't end there. One of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large garbage container. Where Julie did not see her (and would not have helped her anyhow)  and Karol fresh from his public humiliation sneers at her thinking  Someone is worse off than I am, Valentine is the one who helps her. Frailty in need can happen anywhere  and Kieszlowski even applies it here in a minor character.<br /><br />Now  RED is so much more than a story. Valentine  the old judge  Auguste  even Rita the dog: these aren't characters confined by storytelling. An American version would ruin the idea and commercialize chance encounters and even bring forth a dumbed-down ending. RED is so devoid of a linear  defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could have veered off in so many directions had one crucial element not taken place at the exact moment and place.<br /><br />Adding to the concept of characters who mirror each other despite time frames or location is the theme of sexual betrayal. This is also an important and character defining element in all of the three films: in BLUE  Julie's husband had a mistress and she also betrays Olivier when it's become clear she's emotionally dead. In WHITE  Dominique has Karol listen to her moan over the phone (which becomes an important device in RED) as she has sex with a man while the billboard of Brigite Bardot's CONTEMPT looks on. In RED  the old judge's tale of love and betrayal gets re-enacted. And all this time  Valentine's billboard image looms over them like a presage of what is to come at the same time that Rita  the dog Valentine's car struck  bears seven pups  life renewed for the six major players in this complex trilogy obviously filmed with care and love. Why do I say six? You'll have to watch the movie and wonder.",positive
Brilliant Aussie movie... A little slow at the beginning  but once it gets going you can't stop laughing. When I originally saw the movie I vaguely knew the plot line  as I am not sure if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story  and more so in particular  the director and his mother (obviously names have been changed). I only knew this fact as the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I saw the movie  somehow my stepmum kept it secret that we were to meet Matthew Newton after the screening... Such a nice gentleman (except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex)! Brillian casting as well with Sam Neill and others! A great reason to keep supporting the Australian film industry,positive
A boy who adores Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens receives  much to his horror  a Toronto Maple Leafs sweater in the mail. I recently watched this in a class in which few of the students were interested in hockey  but nearly everyone knew about Maurice Richard and the Toronto/Montreal rivalry. Highly entertaining  amusing  and accurate.,positive
I saw this film purely by chance. It was shown very late  or more correctly very early one morning on television. I had woken up and was having trouble getting to sleep and this film came on.<br /><br />It deals with a subject covered many times elsewhere (it certainly isn't as good as Educating Rita  despite a couple of additional twists) and has a very predictable ending.<br /><br />Despite its very obvious shortcomings I did enjoy the film and this was thanks to the acting of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a whole.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Sam Neil and have seen him in many different films including: Dead Calm; The Piano; Sirens; Children of the Revolution; Event Horizon; Bicentennial Man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park. He was very good but he could have played this part with his eyes shut.<br /><br />Some of the acting was  in my opinion  dreadful Rose Byrne for example and some of the elusions were rather heavy handed (all the board woman in empty lives all dressed totally in white for example).<br /><br />However  two actors (who I hadn't  or don't remember  seen before) impressed me a lot Sinéad Cusackn as Frances (Frank) Kennedy  and especially Matthew Newton as her son David. He  in particular  was very convincing and I would like to see a lot more of him.,positive
This marvelous short will hit home with everyone who  as a child  specifically asked for something because it was hip or cool  only to be given something that would mark you for life with your peers and were told by your Mom or Dad (or both) that it didn't matter  as you earnestly began considering enlisting in a Witness Protection Program in order to avoid ridicule. For those U.S. residents who don't get the horror because you don't follow hockey  it's like a Dallas Cowboy fan getting a Washington Redskins jersey or a Yankees fan getting a Red Sox jersey. It isn't pretty. For our European friends  think of two great rival football (soccer to us) clubs and imagine a fan of one getting a jersey from the other. Ouch!!!

"A fantastic film featuring great Aussie talent. Director Mark Lamprell dealt with the potentially sob-inducing subject matter in a way which was humorous and refreshing. Definitely the highlight of the 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival. Australian film veteran  Sam Neill was  as always  fabulous in the role of Frank's uni professor and new talent Matt Newton gave a performance which will have people saying   you know, Bert Newton, Matt's dad! Get out and see this movie!!!",positive
The Australian public and the Australian film industry are often heard to complain that there are not enough great Aussie films around  or that they are all the same.<br /><br />Well in this case this film is not a carbon copy of other Australian films. It is unique - it will make you laugh out-loud  it will make you cry and it will make you feel really good about yourself.<br /><br />The casting of this film is superb and the acting is second to none. The script and the photography (colour/light etc) is wonderful. But more important this is a great film. I don't want to talk about the plot as I think it is always best to see a film knowing as little about it as possible. Suffice to say this film will appeal to a wide range of audiences. Take your girlfriend  take your Mum  take your friends - for a great evening out.<br /><br />10/10!!!!,positive
I can't see how a film of this quality only gets an average of 5.7 from IMDb voters. It's a classic Australian production that resembles recent efforts such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES  THE SUGAR FACTORY  OCCASIONAL COARSE LANGUAGE  RUSSIAN DOLL  SAMPLE PEOPLE  THE SECRET LIFE OF US  LA SPAGNOLA  STRANGE PLANET  FRESH AIR  DUST OFF THE WINGS  DOING TIME FOR PATSY CLINE  etc...  as a 19-year-old uni student (Newton  in perhaps his best role yet  on par with CHANGI at least) with a bored  over-religious mother gets the shock of his life when she decides to enrol in the same course as him - and before you go thinking ANOTHER GOOFY MOVIE  it's not  there's some real substance here. Sure  it's a simplistic view of life in general and arts students in particular (but then they are rather simplistic under all that philosophical mumbo-jumbo aren't they?)  and maybe the study of Sinead Cusack's character is a little muddled at times  but the film is bright  funny  and has some important messages. The principle cast is terrific: Cusack and Newton are wonderful  and Rose Byrne (see her also in THE GODDESS OF 1967) is so underrated it's not funny. She's a beautiful  fresh  confident actor who deserves every accolade she receives. I gave MY MOTHER FRANK 8/10.,positive
My Mother Frank begins as a warm  amiable comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank  short for Francis  played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes herself out of the doldrums by enrolling as a student in her son's university. Most of her friends and family are horrified  not least her son (Matthew Newton)  who is busy falling in love with his best mate's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile Frank has raised the ire of her disapproving English tutor (Sam Neill).<br /><br />Matthew Newton is utterly disarming as David; relaxed and natural in the role  even when the character's uptight. He generates valuable goodwill  steering the audience through some of the film's more awkward  broad comedy moments. Not long after the half-way point  first-time writer-director Mark Lamprell expertly steers his film into darker emotional territory and gives Cusack a real chance to shine.<br /><br />The supporting cast is full of familiar and welcome faces (Lynette Curran  Sacha Horler  Nicholas Bishop) and all the principals (including a more animated than usual Sam Neill) are excellent. While it meanders a little towards the end  My Mother Frank delivers more than it promises and is a genuine Australian crowd-pleaser.,positive
The Japanese have probably the most sadistic movies around the world and this is one of the strongest examples.With a running time at about an hour it contains enough sexual violence and gore to disgust every single sane person on earth(even those who are hunting this type of movies).Three men and a woman are making a porn film.After some normally shots(which are pixelated) the girl is tied up and the madmen cut her food arm and tong.After that they make a hole in her abdomen and a man has sexual intercourse with her intestines.He is knocked unconscious too and has his penis cut off.The special effects are good for an obviously low budget production(only the tong cut scene looks fake) and we can't talk about acting direction or screenplay.After hearing a lot about this film I was very happy when I finally found it.The first part is pretty boring but the second one totally f***k up my mind the torture and killing scenes being some of the most extreme and disturbing I have ever seen.The gore hounds will be satisfied by Tumbling Doll of Flesh but an unknowing viewer shouldn't even read the synopsis.,positive
Tumbling Doll of Flesh (aka Niku daruma and Psycho: The Snuff Reels) This was on my want list for quite a while  and then I finally scored a copy on Ebay a while back. It's never been on DVD  and what I got from Ebay was a very good quality DVD-R  which I'm quite satisfied with. The movie is I believe the most extreme example of torture porn  with an emphasis on porn. A woman responds to an ad for a porn movie and goes with the producer to a place where it is filmed. The porn is definitely real  with the annoying Japanese pixelation to try and hide the hardcore shots  without much success most of the time. After the porn movie is shot and the actress is ready to leave  she gets clubbed over the head with a baseball bat  and taken back to the room and savagely dismembered in slow shots  and in one of the most disgusting scenes  the male porn guy screws her in an open wound in her chest. This is after both legs have been severed  her arm  and a few other niceities. This movie outdoes the Guinea Pig series by a long shot  in fact  they are not even close to the realism  although cheap gore effects  shown in this movie. This is indeed one of the best fake snuff films I have ever seen  if not the best. Now I must warn you  that if you are not into this stuff  you should stay far far away. This movie is very strong  and with the real sex  it is in a very sick way  erotic to an extent. And I mean  in a very sick way. But wherever you come down on this subject material  this movie brings the goods home  and I would definitely recommend you seek it out. After reading about the movie  I was expecting something very strong  but it exceeded that by a bunch.,positive
First of all   you should watch this only if you don't mind the lack of subtitles   pornography   kinky sex and utter   horrifying and truly shocking depravity . I mentioned kinky sex   but to call sex in the second half of the movie  kinky  would be a great understatement . It's more like a punch in the face if you aren't prepared for this sort of sickness . That being said   I can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo - snuff genre brought to us by our fellow Japanese .<br /><br />The plot seems to be fairly basic   almost nonexistent : a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movie . Don't expect much in first 30 - 40 minutes . There is some dialog - if you don't speak Japanese it's not going to mean much to you - that seems to be an occasional chatting between the girl and the crew & performer   then there is some porn ( straight sex )   and after the scene is finished the performers and the crew take a break . And then ... it starts to happen .<br /><br />It seems that the girl is talked into performing one more scene - this time tied with the rope . The abuse begins : whipping   slapping   hot wax ... In the end   girl breaks down and cries . They untie her .<br /><br />Then we see performers and crew sitting at the table as if nothing had happened - except for the girl . She is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave . She walks to the door   sits on the floor to put her shoes on ... and that's when hell breaks loose .<br /><br />She is hit in the head with the baseball bat   her wound is treated   she is tied to the bed . What ensues can be briefly described ( I'm not going to spoil everything for you ) as rape during dismemberment . Think of  Flower of flesh and blood    mix it with porn and you will get the idea .It goes on for about 20 minutes or so . SFX are very good   makeup too . Everything is shown   with no mercy for the viewer . You have been warned .<br /><br />I thought  Visitor Q  was a very sick movie . After watching  Niku daruma  it looked like a fairytale to me .This movie is so sick   so depraved   so twisted   so disgusting that the harshest words pale in comparison to it's finale . Too bad it's released only on VHS so there are no subtitles available . But the movie still works without them . So   if you are into ultra sickness   extreme sadism and other beauties of this beloved genre   check this out . I hope you won't have nightmares .8/10 .,positive
If you were enjoyed by watching Guinea Pig - then you'll like this movie to! Psycho: The Snuff Reels is a nice pseudo snuff movie with lots of sex elements. Actually the effects are not so realistic like in Guinea Pig  but its still pretty gory.<br /><br />Psycho: The Snuff Reels contains 70 minutes of sex  fetish and then torture scenes. First 20 minutes is like a normal porno movie. After that you'll see fetish sex scenes. And last one is a torture scene. The guys torture and rape girl - they cut off her legs  hand  tongue... In the end guy rapes girl in her stomach (!) and after that other guy beat him and cut off his balls. Sounds pretty sick  isn't it?:) <br /><br />Like I said - it's pseudo snuff movie. Psycho: The Snuff Reels is pretty rare Japanese movie and as I know it's really hard to find it. But if you are crazy about that sort of films I believe that you can find it!,positive
Tumbling Doll of Flesh by Tamakichi Anaru is a Japanese shocker about three thugs who sexually abuse torture and dismember a young woman whilst filming their horrible actions.Typically twisted Japanese porno sickie that offers plenty of sadistic sexual violence and grisly gore.There is no plot to speak of just plenty of hard core sex scenes(optically censored again)and lots of blood.The special effects are quite impressive-the dismemberment of Japanese porn actress is shown in unflinching detail.The tongue cutting scene really made me squirm.Her arm is also chopped off and her stomach is graphically sliced open and finally one of the sickos is having sex with her intestines.Psycho:The Snuff Reels actually reminds me Guinea Pig:Flowers of Flesh and Blood but it's not as memorable.So if you're a fan of ultra-depraved Japanese sickies like All Women Are Whores or Raping My Virgin Slave give this one a look.8 out of 10.,positive
The word Ghilli actually means a small sharp wooden game instrument that is used in a game called ghilli-danda (a precursor to Cricket) in India. The use of the word as nickname for the principal character is stylish  as it signifies one who is sharp  fast and can hurt badly when rubbed in the wrong way.<br /><br />Ghilli is one of the best movies for Vijay and in it is unrivaled in its pace and action. The movie never slacks for a moment  and keep you always with some exciting action. The movie is set in Madurai and Chennai and its story core is simple. A rich landlord tries to covet a beautiful girl in his town  and his unquestionable power and authority  prevents the girl from seeking a justice. The hero tries to rescue her and the majority of this movie portrays the week in which all this action happens.<br /><br />A very exciting movie and though the story is nothing new  the director and the actors receive praise for the full-paced action.,positive
Animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful Canadian film. This short feature is dripping with Canadian references  and so  this film will probably be appreciated by Canadians most of all. But the basic story is universal  and it is told lovingly by writer Roch Carrier. It is a hilarious story that I have known for quite sometime  and I was recently fortunate enough to see it again  so I simply HAD to write a hearty recommendation for it. This is a masterpiece  and a must-see whether or not you are Canadian.,positive
if u haven't seen Vijay in Ghillli  Gilly or Ghillie. go watch it. wow. its devastatingly hilarious. i don't know if Dharani (the brilliant director) was being serious or not. There are tons of hot guys in this one  look out for someone who calls Velu Maacha. The one with the brilliant braids  devastatingly hot. His teeth are brilliant as well. Vijay rocks. Trisha cries every 5 seconds. It is very deep. Watch it  you won't regret it. There are some great laughs in this one. If you don't speak Tamil  learn it. Then you will get all the inside jokes. It is one for the whole family  except maybe the violent bits should be skipped. I've seen this movie around eleven times .... and counting.<br /><br />Wow!,positive
Ghilli is the best movie of vijay & one of the biggest hit in his career.... As I had not seen the Telegu movie so I could enjoy this movie even more.The story is about a girl wanting to escape the clutches of a local goon who wants to forcibly marry her. Since he is a goon so no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay who had come to play a Kabaddi match there sees this and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how vijay helps her & how the girl ultimately escapes the clutches of the goon & the goon's father's political cronies. The movie has lot of the edge of the seat thriller moments and will keep the viewer engaged till the end. Vijay is as usual very good in role of the kabaddi player. Trisha Ashish Vidyarthi the bunch of vijay friends all have done their job competently. A special mention has to be made about the villain of the movie Prakashraj.The villain's character has been properly etched out and prakashraj has portrayed it very well. Surprisingly  for the first time  I felt sympathy for the villain in the end. The dialogue Hi Chellam has really caught on with the masses. The music by vidyasagar is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage all over..Dharani has to be credited with such a nice masala movie which will be enjoyed by not just die hard vijay fans but also by the general tamil movie audience all over the world.,positive
brilliant screenplay..<br /><br />the screenplay is very tight ..that u will be gelled in seat..<br /><br />this movie is an example for movie can survive only with screenplay and no-story needed..<br /><br />story is very simple that u can write in one line. but screenplay was amazing..<br /><br />brilliant performance by Vijay and Prakashraj..<br /><br />though plot is similar to okkadu.. director adapted only the plot. Tamil version is much fast paced than Telugu.<br /><br />Movie travels straight without any chance of deviation  though u can understand each and every characters back-drop.<br /><br />keep going,positive
Am an ardent Vijay fan. I have never seen another movie of his which is as good as this.<br /><br />It has all the regular clichés that one can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is bad in studies but a star in his forte i.e.Kabbadi. His friends to fill in the comedy quota. A heroine in a life-and-death situation. A villain  which I say is the best ever portrayed by the protagonist. High octane chase and action sequences. Music that can make one dance. And above all that a perfect storyline to keep all the above factors within an enjoyable circle. Perfect.<br /><br />The director doesn't give any chance for the audience to loosen up. He just goes on from one nail on the head to the next. And one can see the lighter side of Vijay in this film which he rarely executes.<br /><br />All said.....This movie was and will be perfect for many years to come....,positive
If you have seen the Telugu version of Gilli Okkadu you will find this to be very similar in story line  but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu not Andra pradesh. Although this is a remake of Okkadu you will find that Vijay and Trisha make this a unique film  Vijay and Trisha make a great pair. A few negatives were when Vijays character slaps Trishas character for going to buy a present for him  he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end. Good action and songs make this an all around great movie I recommend it.<br /><br />I give it a 10/10  one of the best I have seen.,positive
I have to admit that I absolutely loved this movie. Of course as I'm sure you know that Malcolm's in the Middle star Frankie Muniz  and the ever so sweet Amanda Bynes The Amanda Show starred in this children's comedy as two friends that I'm sure that we can all re-late to. The movie is about a boy Jason Shepard(Frankie) and his friend Kaylee(Amanda)going onto an adventure in Hollywood.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />As it begins Jason is a typical 14 year old boy whom lies to get around every day life's problems. One day Jason is hit by Mr. Wolf(the big bad director). Jason's english paper is stolen by Wolf and begins the adventure along with kaylee to earn his father's trust back. They fly to Hollywood in search of Wolf to get him back. Frankie and Amanda do all sorts of crazy stunts to get Wolf back  and all he has to do is call Jason's dad and tell him he stole his idea. But the end is no real surprise  being the good proveles and wins.<br /><br />The story is cute and fifth grade humored but what do you expect it's rated PG. I really belive this is one of the years best family comedies. Not only is the childrens acting great  exceptional casting  well written  but it's good clean fun. It made me laugh as well as fall in love with it's innocent message. I highly reccomend it and would like to disagree with that someone who gave it a zero out of ten. The unemployed critic isn't unemployed for nothing. I give it (well i voted a ten out of ten) a perfect.,positive
Big Fat Liar is the best movie ever! It is funny  and cool. Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz) proves that he was not lying and goes to Los Angeles to Get his paper back from Marty Wolf( Paul Giamatti). Along with friend Kaylee(Amanda Bynes)  mess up his life since Marty won't call Jasons' dad and say he wrote the paper! Yet it all turns out good and is a good movie to watch!,positive
Well it might be a kid's movie...perhaps but i'm not gonna let my kids from 9 watch it! so the one who say it is a kid movie hmm?! it is teenager movie i agree.. so but back to the movie it is about a boy who can lie very good.. so good that at the end nobody nows truth or lie.Anyway it is a nice movie to see nice screen play i vote a 8 for screen play and story ...i think they writers mend a litlle lesson whit it...''the truth is never overated''.,positive
I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious; It's not like American Pie or something. I know not why people are offended by the Universal plugs; since it's part of the plot  the advertising is excusable.<br /><br />This is a funny movie with good dialogue  good subtle wit  a good story  a good moral (that thankfully doesn't get too sappy)  GREAT acting  and a cheesy ending.<br /><br />(minor spoiler) The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy (Muniz) who lies so much that no one believes him when the Wolf (Giamatti) comes along. So he gets his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they go and drive the Wolf crazy.<br /><br />Frankie Muniz can be annoying in other roles  but not as Jason Shepherd. He handles the suave confidence of his character perfectly well  and what appears to be a lack of expression at first glance is really a perfectly executed nonchalantness.<br /><br />Amanda Bynes. What more can I say? The girl's got the gift. She's funny  talented  versatile  and very  very attractive. (I'm only 6 months older than her. I need to get to California sometime soon.) In fact  the 'best-friend' part was originally a boy  but became a girl as soon as the makers saw Amanda's interest. Which works out pretty well  since the part would've been pretty dull without the blessing of Bynes's abilities.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. While some would play Marty Wolf as evil and diabolical  Giamatti made him-not just a jerk  mind you  but a LIKEABLE jerk  a jerk that livens up the screen  rather than intentionally dimming it. And I doubt many other actors could pull off the psychological breakdown that Wolf undergoes as well.<br /><br />All in all  great movie. Loved seeing Jaleel White able to mock himself. Loved seeing all the little references & such built into the film. (one of the guests in the party scene is the director  Shawn Levy  another is Bynes's former co-star Kenan Thompson) Loved seeing Amanda in those outfits........ Get the DVD if you can. It's got all kinds of great extra stuff  and the lovely Ms. Bynes is your guide through the menus. :),positive
Having been raised in Canada  I saw this short many times mostly on the CBC. I have seen it numerous times  at many ages in my life  and each time the reactions are the same. It is a joyous bittersweet  beautifully animated film that tugs at your heart. I am sure I have it on some VHS tape somewhere digging around.<br /><br />Every kid growing up can relate to the situation  and wanting to fit in with your favourite idols. The scene and look on the kids face when his mom is filling out the Eatons catalogue and his jumping around the room is priceless. I haven't seen someone capture that carefree mood of youth on film as well as this little short has.<br /><br />Sure I am a Montreal habs fan  and that makes my appreciation for it more special. But in the end it is the nostalgic look and feel of pond hockey  and the memories of your family telling you that you should be greatful for what you get even if it isn't exactly what you wanted. And oh yeah  the animation is beautiful too ;)<br /><br />Rating 10 out of 10,positive
Who said it had to be believable? Do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film. You'll enjoy the experience much more. You'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie's more outlandish plot set-ups  and simply accepting it for what it is--a great family film. I appreciated not having to be concerned about questionable elements in a children's film for once. That  to me  is worth the price of the ticket. And it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it--older chidlren will enjoy this film. Enough good humor to keep adults interested. Very good film.,positive
Fun movie! Great for the kids - they found it very entertaining. Somewhat predictable  but there are a few surprises. Great movie to watch if you're looking for something just to entertain (don't expect to be seeing a classic!),positive
With all of the R movies out today  it's hard to find something you can take the whole family to see. My kids loved it. It was good clean fun. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take the whole family out for a nice evening at the movies.,positive
I wasn't expecting much from this tale of a kid whose term paper is stolen and turned into a movie script.. who then he travels to hollywood to get even.. but.. hey.. it's still a fun film. Frankie Muniz of Malcom in the Middle fame stars as the kid and is fairly good and Amanda Bynes as his friend is also very good. Yea the film does work as an advertisement for Universal Studios theme park and is really kinda a silly kids film.. but i enjoyed it anyways. GRADE: B-,positive
SPOILER ALERT!!!! This was my son's review of the movie  which he wanted me to post.He wrote this  I swear.<br /><br />With Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz  and Nickelodeon's Amanda Bynes  they get to go to show business. They team up on the actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's essay on Big Fat Liar  and makes it in to a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) have to go to L.A. to get it back. Jason's dad does not believe that he wrote that essay. So every time they see each other Jason asks Wolf (Paul Giamatti) to give Jason's dad a call because he wants his essay BACK!!!! Wolf does not make the movie but the President of the company makes it. At the end the family and Kaylee see the movie  Made by Wolf Pictures and based on a real story written by Jason Shepherd.,positive
After seeing Big Fat Liar  I think Jason learned a lot more. When he told the truth about Marty stealing his story  it was like the boy who cried wolf. People heard him  but they didn't believe him. Nobody did anything to help him. Besides  not only Marty's movies stink  so does his advice. The truth is not overrated. I am so glad he got exposed for what he really is. Everyone found out that he stole from that boy  including his parents. Not only he stole from that boy and lied about it  he gave them someone else's work and tried to call it his own  which is plagiarism. Doesn't he know that it is illegal to plagiarize someone's idea? Another reason why he got fired. He is not trustworthy. He's a liar  a cheat  a thief  a crook  and a plagiarist. You got that Marty? You're a plagiarist. Plus  you got everything that you deserved.,positive
Big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. But as I was watching it  I thought about something. Some of the events that occur in this film are unbelievable. So really  the film is kind of a big fat lie. There is no way that he could've gotten away with all of this. Here are all of the unbelievable stuff.<br /><br />1. When he fakes his father had choked on a meatball  and acts like he is the father. Jason(Frankie Munez) couldn't have gotten away with that. Well  luckily for us  he didn't. So it didn't stick with it  the outrageous.<br /><br />2.Even if the Grandmother was blind  she still could've figured out that that wasn't her granddaughter. <br /><br />3.They couldn't have gotten on the plane  flown to L.A.  acted like they were coat salesmen  sneak into the studio  and then  and then... Well  some of the film is a little unbelievable. But it doesn't hurt to tell a little white lie. Trust me  I do it all the time.<br /><br />Big fat liar  though unbelievable at times  is fun. It's also very funny. But let me just say one thing before I continue this review. If Paul Giamatti wasn't in this movie  it would really suck. It would be horrible. Big fat liar is also pretty funny  though corny at times. I give it a thumbs up.<br /><br />Big fat liar:***/****,positive
Big Fat Liar is a great watch for kids of all ages  even adults. I had a great time watching this movie and recommend this to kids of 10 years and under. The laughs never end and the adventurous plot is pretty good too! Frankie Muniz is funny and Marty Wolfe is hilarious! Overall  a nicely made film for kids to enjoy and just have a great time.,positive
"BIG FAT LIAR  in my opinion  is an absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it. When Jason (Frankie Muniz - MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE) and Kaylee (Amanda Bynes - ALL THAT) played those tricks on Marty (Paul Giamatti - DOCTOR DOLITTLE)  I really smiled and felt good. That's what I liked most about this movie. As a matter of fact  everything that happened after Jason's essay erroneously ended up in Marty's hands was hilarious. I especially loved Jaleel White's cameo. When I first saw him  I couldn't be certain  but  when I asked my mother if it was him  she said  Of course! Before I wrap this up  I'd like to say  Like I said earlier, there is a moral to this story, and that moral is, always tell the truth. Now  in conclusion  if you are a fan of Frankie Muniz  Amanda Bynes  or Paul Giamatti  I highly recommend this absolutely hilarious movie with a moral to it.",positive
SPOILER WARNING<br /><br />We've all heard the Boy Who Cried Wolf legend. But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well it might be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd ( Frankie Muniz from Malcolm in the Middle ) is always lying to keep himself out of trouble. One day he is pressured to write an English essay  but it winds up in the hands of sleazy film-maker Marty Wolf ( Paul Giamatti ) who plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood blockbuster. No one believes Jason when he for once tells the truth and he ends up in summer school. However Jason is determined to prove to his parents the truth and travels to L.A. with his friend Kaylee ( Amanda Bynes ). When Wolf refuses to admit he ripped off his story  Jason plans to make Wolf's life a living hell. B.F.L. is no masterpiece but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes of you're time. I wished they could've made it a bit longer though and there aren't that much pranks although they are clever enough ( I like the pool-dye the best ). I might not have liked this as much as I do if it weren't for Paul Giamatti. He is simply hilarious in this. If you have 90 minutes to kill try this out. You might just enjoy it.,positive
I love this movie. <br /><br />Yes  the main character lies  but that's why it's called big fat liar. Even though this kid runs away to Hollywood  it doesn't give kids the idea that they can. Besides  he doesn't just do it for fun or to get away from anything  he does it to regain trust. <br /><br />I don't think it was just one big ad for Universal Studios  because I liked how it gave an inside view of what it's like for kids who don't know how cool movie-making is. <br /><br />It has good music and fun characters. This family/comedy is totally fun for kids and parents alike. It has humour  excitement  and real life difficulties like lying.<br /><br />In the end  Big Fat Liar sends out a moral: don't expect lying to be easy.,positive
This isn't a life-changing movie; it's not an epic  or anything like that. But it's entertaining  and it's fun. It's a film that the whole family can watch together  and at the moment there are precious few kid-suitable films that DON'T have a love story in them! It tells a good story in a lighthearted way without trying to dazzle the audience with over-the-top special effects  like lots of films these days are. It's got some fairly good acting in  and all the music that's been used fits in pretty well with the movie content. The acting is quite good too  the actors look comfortable and believable in their surroundings and most importantly the jokes are actually funny. I'd recommend it for people of all ages - it certainly made me laugh. :),positive
This is one of the funniest movies I've ever saw. A 14-year old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English paper called Big Fat Liar. When his skateboard was taken  he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. When he went into the limo  he met a famous producer from Hollywood  Marty Wolf. When he left the limo  he forgot one thing: his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie! When Jason admitted that he left his paper in the limo and Marty took it  his parents and his English teacher didn't believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood to make Marty admit he stole his story to Jason's parents. When Jason told Marty to call his dad that Marty stole that paper  Marty tricked him and burned his paper! Jason got so angry that Marty burned that paper so Marty called security to get Jason out of his site! Jason and Kaylee realized Marty isn't going to admit the truth. In order to take Marty down in Phase 2: The Takedown  Jason and Kaylee put permanent blue dye into the pool and when Marty jumps in  his body turns all blue and it wouldn't come off! Then they put permanent orange dye in Marty's shampoo and when he uses it  his hair turns all orange and it wouldn't come off too! Finally  they put lots of glue on Marty's earpiece to make him call Jason's father and when Marty uses it  it sticks to his ear! It was funny when Marty's hair and body turns all blue and orange and his headset is glued to his ear! After that  they tricked Marty by telling Monty  who is Marty's assistant  that Duncan moved to a house where there's a party going on. When Marty went in to see Duncan  he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! When Marty was in the house  Jason and Kaylee switched the controls of his car. When Marty drove his car  he knew all the controls were switched and he didn't know which button to push. He's stupid enough to fall for it. When Marty hit the rear end of the masher  the masher wrecked his car! It was so funny. So Marty starts to call Jason's dad and tricked him again! He was on the phone  but it wasn't his father  he called security! After the security got Jason and Kaylee out of Marty's site  they suggested them to go home. Monty was going to be on Jason and Kaylee's side cause she knew that Marty was a liar and a jerk so she told Rocco  who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids. Jason told his father the truth of what he's been up to for the past 2 days and had his parents come to L.A. When Monty came to the kids  she's going to help the kids move into Phase 4: The Payback. Jason splits the crew into 3 teams for Phase 4. One team will distract and trick Marty until Jason's parents get to the set. Marty first rode with Frank Jackson  but his car broke down so he rode with Jaleel  but he took him into the desert and leave him there. When Marty was in the desert  a helicopter came to rescue him. After that  one of the blades are jammed so Marty and the pilot got off the helicopter. After that  he was on the way to the set and when Jason saw him  Marty stopped and saw what Jason has: his monkey! So Marty went after Jason and Kaylee and when they saw Lester  he released the water and when the water came  it pushed Marty away. Marty was still after the kids and when Kaylee went the other way  Jason led Marty to the top of the apartment building. At the top  Jason was challenging Marty by making him admit the truth and Marty will never ever tell the truth. When the crew caught Marty in surprise  all the people including Jason's parents who were at the set knew what Marty did. Marty was going to kill Jason but the only way for Jason to escape is jump down from the top! After that  his parents believed him that Marty took his story. When the people who were on the set left  this is the end of Marty. At the end  Jason's story  Big Fat Liar was a movie. I cant get enough of it.,positive
I could watch this movie ALL DAY! I LOVE it. Probably my all time favorite movies. But  by the way  badger1970 there are a few parts with bad language  not TOO bad  but it's not exactly G rated. GREAT movie!!!!! I recommend it to everybody. Any way  it's making me type 10 lines of text  so I am going to keep typing until it will let me post this comment. Okay... Still typing... This is getting annoying. Ugh. I still have four more to go. Anyway  WATCH THIS MOVIE! Even if you have already seen it. I DON'T CARE! Has it been 10 lines yet? Nope. Only 2 more lines left. I don't even know why it wants me to do this. I think I am done. Wait a minute  I'm NOT done  SORRY  people. I know it's torture listening to me. WEll  I suppose that you don't HAVE to read this comment... But you should  because I wrote it. I am probably done now. Finally  bye.,positive
Much better than expected. Good family flick - catch it on reruns. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti chews up the scenery - he has way more talent then the role deserves. A treat to watch Inspector Uhl from The Illusionist go over the top. The blue man scenes had my 11 year old in stitches. The cameos were particular fun for the parents - nice to see Lee Majors and Urkel (umm  Jaleel) again. It's going to be tough to think up 10 lines for this film   but let's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents! Amanda Bynes does a fine job when she gets to be part of the sting. I normally can't stand Frankie Muniz but he is just fine here. Hats off to the casting director - if only for hiring Giamatti!,positive
I can't understand why IMDb users would rate this movie 5.2/10? It really is great  very funny. I would strongly recommend this movie for all of you  adults  teenagers and especially children! <br /><br />The story is about a 14-year-old kid who always tell lie  at home and school. One day he had his homework of writing a 1000-word-story. But he didn't  so the teacher told him to write it and gave her in 3 hours  or he would have to go to Summer School. Yep  he wrote it in 2:45. Big fat liar  I think it was a story of himself. On the way to the school he hit a limo of a famous Hollywood producer  and he gave him a ride. But the kid forgot the story in the limo. He told his parents and the teacher  but of course  they did not believe him. And the movie producer  he took the kid's story as his new movie  Big fat liar. When the kid saw the trailer of the movie  he told his parents he had written it  but they didn't believe. So  he and his friend had to go to L.A to prove one thing: The truth is never overrated <br /><br />Enjoy this great movie  you won't be disappointed. Don't trust the 5.2/10 rate  it should be 9/10! Believe me! <br /><br />P/S: so sorry  my English isn't good enough to make a better comment!,positive
I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one. Paul Giamatti lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot. He would probably say it was easy  but he really does a great job and should have won something for it. We've had the DVD for several years and my kids (boy now 4 1/2 and girl 9) will watch this one over and over  and the humor is adult enough that I don't mind having to hear it in the background (and I do run to the TV for the really funny parts). Simple moral message  lots of decent action and slapstick  bad grownups acting goofy to take the edge off  minimal bad language and minimal potty jokes make it hard to beat for a family standard.,positive
This movie was fun! Especially if your between 8 and 15. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes make a believable team of 8th graders getting back at an adult who really deserves it. Paul Giamatti makes a great adult who you really want to 'get'. My 13 year old daughter and her friend loved it. Parents: No really bad words or any sex to worry about. Recommend it for the 'right' crowd. AP,positive
Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing  great production  and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap. The two stars work great together  and--what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Putting Irkel and Lee Majors in the film were brilliant touches. Watch this film with your kids. If you don't laugh throughout it  you must not have been paying attention.,positive
I've seen this story before but my kids haven't. Boy with troubled past joins military  faces his past  falls in love and becomes a man. The mentor this time is played perfectly by Kevin Costner; An ordinary man with common everyday problems who lives an extraordinary conviction  to save lives. After losing his team he takes a teaching position training the next generation of heroes. The young troubled recruit is played by Kutcher. While his scenes with the local love interest are a tad stiff and don't generate enough heat to melt butter  he compliments Costner well. I never really understood Sela Ward as the neglected wife and felt she should of wanted Costner to quit out of concern for his safety as opposed to her selfish needs. But her presence on screen is a pleasure. The two unaccredited stars of this movie are the Coast Guard and the Sea. Both powerful forces which should not be taken for granted in real life or this movie. The movie has some slow spots and could have used the wasted 15 minutes to strengthen the character relationships. But it still works. The rescue scenes are intense and well filmed and edited to provide maximum impact. This movie earns the audience applause. And the applause of my two sons.,positive
"I saw this movie on my flight from Philly to Denver. The screen was three rows in front of me and about 12 x 10. So I really wasn't going to watch it. But I like Malcolm in the Middle  so I thought I'd watch just a few minutes. Next thing I know I'm sucked in  having a great time  and was pleased as how good it was and how fast it seemed to make the time go by. I agree with that the acting is very good for this level of entertainment. Being one of the older baby boomers  I was also pleased to see Lee Majors with a role in the movie  as with a couple of other actors who were famous (Jamiel?) yesterday but are out of the spotlight today poking fun at themselves.<br /><br />It's your basic kid is wronged, kid gets even (and then some), and everyone enjoys themselves in the process. No heavy thinking  no great analysis needed. Just a good fun way to pass the time.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5.",positive
"Big Fat Liar comes as a welcome -- shallow  but welcome -- breath of fresh air after one too many films featuring bathrooms  bodily fluids  pets on acid  gaseous jokes and crotch gags. After all  See Spot Run, Max Keeble's Big Move and Snow Dogs had signaled The Degenerative Spiral of Kiddie Movie-making. Worse is the realization that the young audience would later be satiated by the smuttier offerings of Not Another Teen Movie and Slackers. Written by Nickelodeon producers Dan Schneider and Brian Robbins (who coincidentally co-starred on the '80s sitcom Head of the Class)  the film stars Frankie Muniz as Jason  who's always ready with a good lie to get out of scrapes. (Where's the English paper? Dad choked on a Swedish meatball.) His teacher (Sandra Oh) issues an ultimatum: Turn in the paper by the end of the day or take summer school. Jason whips out a story called Big Fat Liar and is struck en route to school by a limousine carrying insensitive Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). Wolf gives him a ride  but Jason leaves his paper behind. No one will hear the truth this time  and Dad tells him he's lost his trust.<br /><br />Months later  Jason and best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) see a movie preview for Big Fat Liar, and head off to Los Angeles to wreak havoc on Wolf's life -- all to get a confession that he stole Jason's paper to make the film. They even gain the sympathy of some of Wolf's abused employees  including his assistant (Amanda Detmer)  former chauffeur (Donald Faison)  movie star (Jaleel Urkel White  playing himself) and stunt coordinator (a much-aged Lee Majors).<br /><br />Because Big Fat Liar is without the edge that his sitcom Malcolm in the Middle is known for  Muniz is easy to root for but doesn't have much to work with. Likewise for Bynes  who headlines her own Tracey Ullman-like sketch show on Nickelodeon. All the hamminess is given to Giamatti  whose eyes bulge and cheeks wiggle with every sneering insult.<br /><br />The film gets snaps just by attempting the high road  and should be enjoyed by its target audience (especially since most of the high jinks occur on the Universal Studios lot). But here's one head-scratcher: The message is that it pays to tell the truth. But didn't we just see Jason getting to his payback by telling white lies throughout the film? Well  at least there's no poop.",positive
This Movie is really an entertaining  good clean fun movie  for the kiddies. Kaley(played by Nickelodeon's talented Amanda) is the sidekick to a rambunctious boy who has a hard time telling the truth. He eventually works this into a movie script that gets stolen. I won't bore you with the details. If you have children and want to see an entertaining if not thrilling kids movie  I highly recommend this one.,positive
Okay  I'll admit that if I didn't have kids  I never would have seen this film and would never see it. But  considering all the rotten kids movies I have seen (such as SPY KIDS 2 or BABE: PIG IN THE CITY)  this is a significant improvement. And  it had enough in it that I wasn't totally bored out of my skull or contemplated suicide (something I did repeatedly in the other two movies). Sure  the performances are pretty broad and the plot is kinda silly--but it IS a kids film. And  compared with other films in the genre  this is definitely better than average. Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bines actually appear to have some talent and probably will continue to have careers after puberty--at least on infomercials or doing voice-overs.<br /><br />So  if you are looking for a film to see with your kids  you certainly could do a lot worse!,positive
It is a nice comedy. It has the great features of the childhood  lying or trying to get away from own generated troubles. The casting is great  great acting. And the special effects ? Well  some stunts are really impressive. Watch it! :),positive
For a TV movie this was definately worth seeing. All the acting was very well done and the story itself had a touching universal theme. I have not read/seen the original and as a rule I can't stand Shakespeare  but I enjoyed this movie(the civil war setting was very well done as well). Dont expect to see an epic  however you should find it moving enough to enjoy. By the way (on a side note) don't compare this (or any other movie for that matter) to the original work. Movies aren't supposed to transfer a book to the screen  but rather take the general idea of it a then adapt a story from it. When people say the book was so much better (they're usually wrong anyway) what they are really trying to say is the book was so different.,positive
Never having read or seen the Bard's original work  I can't begin to compare this work to his story. So I won't. Instead I will just say that this was a very entertaining story with some very nice special effects (and some that looked a little lower in budget  but still decent enough to enjoy). I thought all the primary actors did a fine job performing. The style of magic seemed more black than white and is almost certain to offend anyone easily upset about that sort of thing  but I thought it was well done.,positive
...but it's still an entertaining TV movie. The transposition to the Civil War makes a nice change of pace  and adds a few subtexts (such as Ariel's servitude to Prosper/Prospero) that you might not otherwise see. Thankfully  they didn't try to make it a mini-series: at 90 minutes  it's just about right.,positive
This is a masterful piece of film-making  with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian  self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship  lust and love  dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns  jealousy  rivalry  cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more. A mature  subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to  though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it). But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment  with inventive and elegant use of close-up  camera angle and lighting  including pointillistic faux home movie footage  is a wonder and joy to behold. It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci  but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work. A very rare type of film these days - it holds the attention and stirs the emotions without abandoning artistic integrity and succumbing to manipulative  superficial shortcuts.,positive
Can't grade this very well  because I can't say I liked it. But it is the story that bothered me  not the realization of the film. The acting  directing  atmosphere  music were all good. It's just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you can't truly relate to  the movie ends. It is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings don't need to make any sense at all and still be strong  but that's about it.<br /><br />The plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet Dylan Thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex-girlfriend. He is married  brings his wife and later the kid  while the ex (Knightley) marries some other guy. But the tension is there  Dylan is a self obsessed jerk and the new husband comes back home from the war with a slight case of PTSD. Add in some pretty temperamental characters and you have your hands full.<br /><br />Bottom line: you have to be in the mood to like this film. The hard part is defining this mood. I don't think I've ever been in it yet. Ever. So it is probably better watched by adults with a grasp on weird complex human behaviour and maybe a curiosity about Dylan Thomas.,positive
This short deals with a severely critical writing teacher whose undiplomatic criticism extends into his everyday life. When he learns why that's not a good idea  we learn a bit about the beautiful craft of writing that he's been lecturing on.,positive
Although I am very familiar with poet Dylan Thomas  I know nothing of his life. Whatever his life and specifically his marriage involved  I would imagine that The Edge of Love (based on the novel) manipulates things a bit  but unless you are a historian or a poet  who cares.<br /><br />The movie is less about Thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life. One is his wife Kathrine  and the other is Vera who was his first love. One romantic night on the beach as youths is something that both have tried to put behind them but cannot  now grown up they are good friends. I forgot to mention that this is set during the war. Vera becomes engaged to Captain Will Killing who he gets her pregnant and leaves for war. While he is away  Vera starts to fall for Thomas again  and Kathrine has fallen out of love with him. She is also carrying another man's child. Things get even more emotionally complex when Capt Killig returns<br /><br />As you can see  it is a very soap operatic plot  and it takes shape in a fairy drab slow manner  with perhaps one too many sequences of sappy dialogue. But all is not lost yet. For a non- Hollywood production  I think that the Edge of Love is about as stylish a picture as one can get. It is certainly more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary romances  Hollywood production or not. Some of it has to do with being set during the war  which sets up emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial  a bit like Atonement. this one features acting and cinematography of equal talent to Joe Wright's Oscar nominee  but it is in far greater need for stable pacing and progression. Things are okay at the start and finish  but the middle section is where your attention span may be tested  unless you are deeply and profoundly rooted in the story. <br /><br />I doubt if The Edge of Love will have that kind of an effect on the viewer  but is a good film to check. it might even make a good date night movie  considering it is so much smarter than the chick flicks that boyfriends are forced to endure today.,positive
This movie  with all its complexity and subtlety  makes for one of the most thought-provoking short films I have ever seen. The topics it addresses are ugly  cynical  and at times  even macabre  but the film remains beautiful in its language  artful with its camera angles  and gorgeous in its style  skillfully recreating the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories  Tobias Wolff.<br /><br />Not wishing to spoil anything of the movie  I won't go into any details  other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself. It takes pride in what it does  and does it well. It shows the most important memories of life  all of which can be topped by the single most elusive feeling: unexpected bliss. This movie  of its own volition  has created in me the same feelings the main character (Tom Noonan) felt when words transformed his very existence  and that is one impressive feat.,positive
Given that Dylan Thomas is an icon of modern Anglophone poetry I expected a movie that would be prone to a hagiography of the subject. On the contrary the poet is presented as sexually irresponsible  a drunkard  a bad father  a lier and a hypocrite and perhaps a coward. Of course one could argue that all those things are an advantage when some one is an artist and especially a poet since one of the purposes of art is to subvert the standards of conventional morality but still I do not thing that a positive role model could crop up from such a bundle of personality traits. Any way I found the other male hero of the story Captain Cillic a more endearing character. The two female roles were played by actresses Knigtley and Miller and were truly charming especially the first when she performed songs in slim outfit to inspire bombarded Londoners during WW2. Another good point is the role that sexual jealousy plays even in relatively progressive milieus that think that age-old conventions can easily be surpassed.The atmosphere of the Blitz was also convincing as well as the portrayal of the distinct outlooks among people who have experienced war as opposed to those who talk about it theorizing on it's possible political outcomes.I think one would recommend such a movie.,positive
This is primarily about love in WWII  yet we must remember that it's also a biopic for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this particular stage in his life.<br /><br />The movie's timing is just great. It really captures what I think would have been the spirit during those times; smiling and hoping you're not going to get bombed. While it may prove boring to some  the movie does have a particularly dangerous edge to it.<br /><br />At one point  my heart was racing towards the end as the movie hits its climax. It really does feature some poignant moments that are handled with skill by the four main actors. Cillian Murphy is on fine form here  as is Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and it makes for an interesting watch. The relationship formed between Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley's characters is wonderful and we have the acting to thank (and watch out for a cameo by Suggs of 'Madness'). <br /><br />Despite all of this  it's a rather slow movie. Coupled with the fact it's just shy of two hours  it's quite a slog to get to the conclusion.<br /><br />Overall  it's a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderfully crafted moments that were no doubt helped by the splendid number of well-known British names behind the scenes. But it really does drone on for too much at times. Still  a worthwhile watch. 7/10,positive
i did not expect to enjoy this. in truth i watched it because a friend knew a friend knew a friend who wrote the script but wasn't credited. knowing Dylan thomas  and really being appreciative of his poetry but aware and rather disconcerted by the man  i didn't feel i needed to see a twee adaption of his lame bohemian life laid bare. and this was not it. critical and yet appreciative it was. it made me cry. kiera knightley was superb  even with that slightly strained welsh accent and it is a sad tale that they tell. Dylan thomas is not the hero as sadly he was not throughout his life and neither really are the so called 'feisty woman' of the pr spiel. it is cillian the william of the movie. a man that leaves the woman he loves to fight a war that they ignore. his challenge to reoonnect with that indifference is what is of real interest to this film and what a beautiful performance from that actor. i thiink this film is underrated because it was marketed so badly. Dylan thomas fans will expect something more from their so very flawed hero and get less  and well that is how it was marketed. it is not a film about Dylan thomas and it is much more interesting for it.,positive
"This film flopped miserably in the UK  and it didn't deserve to. The trailer of this film is slightly misleading  and I guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was Atonement: Part 2. While the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of Joe Wright's BAFTA-winning film  it's very different in tone. It focuses on an imagination of sorts of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas' life during the Second World War as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort  and his subsequent return to Wales. Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan's (Matthew Ryhs) childhood sweetheart Vera Phillips  played by Keira Knightley. She was Dylan's first love in their homeland  but the moment has passed  and singer Vera only wants it as a beautiful memory. Or does she? Vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in Dylan's life  Queen of Ireland, love of my life, mother of my child Caitlin Thomas (Sienna Miller). The three form a sort of menage a trois in war-struck London  but Vera then falls for a dashing soldier  William Killick (Cillian Murphy). They quickly marry  with Killick leaving for War. A frightened Vera convinces the Thomas' to return witb her to Wales  but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of Vera's child  William's jealousy and shell-shock after returning home  and Caitlin realising she cannot share Dylan with her best friend.<br /><br />Filmed on a low budget  this is more of a mood piece than anything else. It works best as a realisation that some memories and feelings need to be treasured but not renewed. The performance of Sienna Miller is particularly excrellent (unfortunately the paparazzi nonsense detracts from the fact thats she's quite a talent)  and Knightley and Murphy are once again very good. The let-down is Rhys as Dylan  who  while the Welsh poet himself was no bed of roses  lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in Dylan. The writing is very choppy  some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness. It's certainly worth watching  however.",positive
Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller stars in the story of two of the women in the life of Dylan Thomas. Knightley is Thomas's boyhood sweetheart he re-encounters during the Blitz. Meeting at a bar they reconnect  however things become complicated when Thomas' brings his wife (Miller) along the next time he meets her. The women hit it off and things proceed at pace until the trio are joined by the man who will become Knightly's husband. This further complicates things as jealousy begins to show its face.<br /><br />Beautiful to look at  extraordinarily written and wonderfully acted (everyone disappears completely into their roles) this is a sumptuous feast for the eyes and the ears. It's so nice to see a film about adults being adults. On a purely visceral level I really enjoyed watching the film because the film is so artistically pleasing. Rarely have I ever seen a film that is this beautifully crafted.<br /><br />The trouble with the film is I'm not entirely sure of everything that happened. Something seemed to be missing and a couple of times I had to replay the film to see if I missed something. Its not bad  but its not completely satisfying as a result. (I tried to look up on line to see how much of the film is true but I couldn't find anything) Still I think this is a film worth seeing. It's a beautiful film for adults with probably the best acting the leads have done.,positive
Welsh poet Dylan Thomas excused from serving in active duty is doing his bit for the war effort producing bits of prose for some propaganda branch of government in Whitehall.<br /><br />Thomas is portrayed as a freethinker believing in free love married to a woman with an equally demanding artistic streak and likewise with a penchant for extramarital romance. Thomas writing and reciting his poetry in systematic domestic mayhem throughout becomes somewhat priggish towards the end  resting somewhat uncomfortably on his society connections and pulling rank on a war veteran  who had shot up his house  and who was incidentally married to the woman he had been having an affair with.<br /><br />The real story of this film is the love of two women  one (Keira Knightley) whose first love was Thomas (Matthew Rhys)  the second (Sienna Miller) who is Thomas's wife. At times it reminds of The Singing Detective  as in very good television with slightly sinister overtones laid on top of scenes of surreal camp absurdity.,positive
"Where would Hollywood have been without Fredric March as Robert Browning or Dennis Price as Lord Byron  famous lovers in their day? Even an actor as normally straitlaced as Michael Redgrave once brought some moody charm to a portrayal of W.B. Yeats. Writers' lives are an endless source of inspiration.<br /><br />But of all poets it was Dylan Thomas  the roistering  free-loving Welshman who enjoyed a pint or two (and drank himself to death in New York at the age of 39)  who was closest in spirit to the film industry. During World War II  he produced scripts for British propaganda documentaries. He even wrote the screenplay of a vapid melodrama called The Three Weird Sisters  in which three old maids in a Welsh village plot the murder of their rich half-brother. All that is now forgiven.<br /><br />In John Maybury's The Edge of Love  Thomas is played by the Welsh actor Matthew Rhys. It's not a full-scale biopic. The film covers four years in the poet's life during World War II  when he lived with two women: his wife Caitlin (Sienna Miller) and a former lover Vera Phillips (Keira Knightley)  whom he met again by chance during the war. It seems he loved them both. The relationship of these extraordinary women -- to Thomas and to each other -- is at the heart of Maybury's absorbing film.<br /><br />How it came to be made is a story almost as remarkable as that of the lovers themselves. Rebekah Gilbertson  the film's producer  is the granddaughter of Vera Phillips and William Killick. William  a war hero (played in the film by Cillian Murphy)  married Vera while she was still in love with the poet. Gilbertson was inspired to make the film when she discovered a book about her grandparents  Dylan Thomas: A Farm  Two Mansions and Bungalow  by David Thomas  describing their tangled lives. Sharman Macdonald  who wrote the screenplay  is the mother of Knightley. The part requires Knightley to sing  and her mother included songs especially for her. Surely no film with such felicitous family connections deserves to do other than succeed.<br /><br />We begin in London during the Blitz. Bombs are falling  sirens are wailing  and Phillips is singing to sheltering crowds in an underground Tube station. In a pub  by chance  she meets Thomas and discovers after all these years that he has a wife and child. Phillips and Caitlin form a friendship untroubled by jealousy or rancour and are soon sharing beds and bathtubs  listening to Thomas read his poems  exchanging intimate secrets and smoking their heads off  as everyone did in wartime. Caitlin turns out to be more experienced in the ways of the world (My first was Augustus John, he seduced me when I was 15). But it's the refined and soulful Phillips who stirs Thomas's deepest responses and eventually succumbs to his charms. In the meantime  she has reluctantly married Killick  who has seen her in the Tube station and been instantly captivated by her beauty (if not her singing).<br /><br />It is an intense and strangely beautiful film  though Thomas himself may be its least impressive character. He is best remembered for Under Milk Wood  his verse radio play about a day in the life of the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub  whose name spelt backwards was not something polite English teachers drew attention to. I once had a vinyl recording of Richard Burton reading the poem (he appeared in a film of Under Milk Wood in 1971)  and I've never forgotten the creamy  seductive quality of his voice. The legendary charisma  the magnetism of the man  is something I missed in Rhys's performance. Thomas comes across as a strangely pallid  even secondary  figure compared with the women in his life.<br /><br />In his previous film  Love Is the Devil  Maybury explored the turbulent life of painter Francis Bacon and his sadomasochistic relationship with his lover and model  George Dyer. The Edge of Love seems to me a richer and more satisfying film. If you ask what insights it offers into the springs of Thomas's creative inspiration  I would have to say Llareggub. But as an insight into his egotism  his smouldering moods and his general indifference to the feelings of others  it is wonderfully sad and revealing.<br /><br />Thomas had a good war  boozing and writing while other men (including Killick) were being traumatised by the horrors of battle. In one scene near the end  Thomas's behaviour towards his friends seems unforgivably callous. But this is not  after all  Thomas's film. Murphy gives us a magnificent study in doomed passion and the emotional debilitation of war. Miller is charming and pathetic as the wife. And Knightley looks almost too exquisitely delicate to be real (as she did in Pride and Prejudice). But this is probably her finest performance. And in every respect the film is worthy of her.",positive
With its ww2 timing  falling in and out of love  and easy on the eye Kira  this is re-Atonement. <br /><br />This a relationship story with focused main characters working out the the balance between first and fast love in the home front of WW2. Poet Dylan Thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales. <br /><br />Vera's ex and next spark off each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls bond and share. An easy watch that works well in the era bouncing along with just a few dips in pace. Would work well with French subtitles but then I may have been to too many art house movies lately.,positive
